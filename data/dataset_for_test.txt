NotSignal	Hi Everyone,This is my first post on reddit ever, so I hope I'm not breaking any rules...I am not usually someone who has trouble sleeping, but I am often a heavy drinker and during COVID, I was depressed and drinking a ton of vodka, and therefore not getting any real sleep. After a while I started noticing some weird visuals that got more and more intense. I dont think that they were because of alcohol withdrawal because Ive seen this before and they were way different - and really scary. And I was still drunk. But anyways, I would look at an object passively and the object, lets say a fan, would start to vibrate and expand into a cloud, and then these really creepy skinny tentacles would rush out. This would happen until I took my focus away. Loftcraftian sort of ...There were auditory hallucinations and other stuff going on as well.This has happened twice to me and I was lucid enough to do some research on google. Once I though I had discovered that I wasn't completely crazy, I came to think of the Tenticale monster as my friend. Its sad because once I got some sleep, he had left and I felt so alone. I live by myself and COVID has been hell. Has anyone else seen this or anything like it ? I have found one post somewhere in which a woman who was staying up for finals describes something similar, but that's it. Trying to find a visual online that resembles it, but can't.Thanks for listening
NotSignal	Is this safe? It has happened at least 6 times in the past 2 hours of trying to sleep. It’s driving me nuts
Signal	I have pretty bad sleep anxiety that causes me to have insomnia. If I don’t want to spent a part of the night awake, I sometimes take sleeping pills. The only bad thing is that these pills sometimes knock me out. I can be browsing reddit on my phone one minute and waking up hours later and not knowing how and when I fell asleep. Any tips and tricks on how to deal with that?
NotSignal	So I just moved back in my with my parents and I noticed I been sleeping really well. I would fall asleep around 10pm probably wake up around 1am, but in 10 minutes be able go back to sleep. I can't seem to figure out why. Back at my house I couldn't sleep at all and I'd be in my bed wide awake till 5am. Just wondering if anyone experience this problem. Wondering if my bed is the problem or my location.
Signal	I’ve been on ambien for about 2 months now and my insomnia hasn’t improved. I looked up long term sleep aids and found that lunesta was approved for long term use. Just posting this because I would like to hear some success stories with lunesta.
Signal	Hello im a grown 23 year old. Since the quarantene time I developed rly bad insomnia couldn't sleep for 6 days straight, and then I slept every other day but with rly rly poor quality, I went to a psycholog and he prescribed me melperon, mirtacapine, and paraxetine. Now to be straight up honest with you I'm not a fan of medication and I don't feel like taking them, but not sleeping is slowly getting a pain I can barely do anything anymore because I'm super tired. I went to another doctor who said I should maybe try one med at a time and see if it works for me. The thing is I don't know if those meds will solve my problems, or just mess me up, but I rly can't take this much longer I'm scared something might happen to me if I don't sleep well soon... Can anyone help me? :/
Signal	I haven’t slept at all this week, I keep seeing hallucinations and flashbacks. Is this part of my depression? And should I be worried?
NotSignal	I think i should called the Guinness world records. My psych is the reason for this too. When I was crying and saying I didnt sleep for 7 days he said he'd call me back but never did and had to wait more than a week to get a call back and even now hes refusing to give me something to sleep(he has never given me anything for sleep before) so yeah this is literal fucking torture and I think my hearts gonna give out. I went to the er three times and they didnt do anything. Just gave me like elvail and doxepin and sent me home.
NotSignal	So I'm just here laying on my bed doing nothing on my phone im going to be here for a while so let me know how your week has been going if you want you don't have to
Signal	I’ve been having trouble sleeping ever since 2012 but it hasn’t been this bad before. The last week or so I’ve only been able to sleep every other day and the days I don’t sleep I just seem to not be able to fall asleep and experience a ‘tight chest’ idk how else to describe it. It’s an uncomfortable feeling but not horribly bad. I also do feel this tightness throughout the working day, it’s so weird. I’ve been really sick these last 2 weeks (negative covid results) and have been taking meds for it (cold & flu day n night & Tylenol extra) which I usually don’t do. I usually let my sickness ride out and go away naturally but cuz of covid I just want to be back to 100% ASAP. Maybe the tightness could be due to the meds and my body’s lack of exposure to them? I have no clue...Has anyone else experienced similar?
Signal	Alright, so once again I’m dealing with insomnia. It’s currently like 4am and I don’t feel tired, not one bit. Why is this? Usually with my insomnia I feel tired but when I try to fall awake feel alert again, but tonight I’ve just been not tired at ALL even though the other night I only got like six hours of sleep. Why can this be?
Signal	Hi, first time posting here, just looking for some advice since I'm pretty desperate, and I don't know anyone else with my level of insomnia.So just as a background I've struggled with chronic insomnia since I was 12. From then until college I averaged maybe 3 hours of sleep a night, but when I went to college and started taking evening classes, and going to therapy, my sleeping improved. It still takes me 3-4 hours to get to sleep and sometimes I won't at all, but when I do sleep it's around 8 hours. I usually expect to fall asleep around 4 AM, that's normal for me. Because of this, my therapist mentioned I might have DSPD instead of insomnia, but I've never done a sleep study so I don't know for sure, and I can't afford a specialist right now.Lately with the quarantine my sleeping has gotten way worse. I'll sleep like every other night and I'll often have panic attacks or start crying or something out of nowhere when trying to sleep. I know a lot of people are struggling with this too, but if anyone has DSPD I'd love to hear what you do to deal with it right now. Maybe since none of my insomnia coping techniques are working, those might help.
Signal	Falling asleep isn’t too difficult for me but when I do, anything will wake me up and it would be impossible for me to go to sleep. If I have to pee, that’s it no more going back to sleep. A tiny light coming from the crack of the window? I wake up and can’t sleep. One sound from a bird chirping or any other random small noise? Awake.I’ve been like this for years now and I’m still trying to figure out how to turn into a heavy sleeper where nothing will wake me up. I was addicted to Ambien, sleeping pills, or cough syrup to put me to sleep back in the day but I try to rely on those.Is there any way I can make a progression into being a heavy sleeper again?
Signal	I'm looking for something that's comparable to or approaching the effectiveness of ambien, but does not share side effects and tolerance and can be cycled with ambien so I can keep my ambien use down and remain unaddicted. I tried Diphenhydramine and it completely fucked me the next day. Is there anything else?
Signal	Even on nights I was somehow asleep for the majority of it, I'll still be exhausted. It feels like those nights I barely broke the surface of sleep. If sleep were a pool I won't be at the bottom of the deep end of sleep,. It feels like the "sleep" I get is me floating in the shallow end just barely I'm the water. Anyone else feel like your sleep is super shallow and unsatisfying.
NotSignal	(this happens at night regularly too) even tho half an hour before that I finally was getting actually tired on the couch around 7ish am
Signal	I’ve had vague insomnia on and off since I was a young teen (now 22) that was usually just induced by depression, anxiety and overall bad sleeping habits.In a better place now mentally, and even though I’d often hang out with my seriously insomniatic girlfriend till dawn when I couldn’t sleep, I thought the issues had mostly gone away - meditation and hypnosis worked well for me.Then was diagnosed recently with extreme sleep apnea (oxygen levels dip to ~75%, stop breathing an average of 66 times an hour) and started fearing being tired. Was sleeping for 14-20 hours, not able to stay awake longer than 6 hours. My relationship came into a bit of strife during that time because I wasn’t able to spend any time with my girlfriend.Being drowsy makes me anxious now, and even though my sleep apnea has died down a little, the fear of constantly being tired is keeping me from sleeping at all - or, sleeping at 10am and waking at 5pm.Some days are worse than others. It’s 9am and I’ve tried meditation, hypnosis, getting up for a little then coming back to bed, music, rain sounds, having a cigarette, getting a drink, even getting *frisky* to try to tire myself out. Nothing.Just feeling a little hopeless at the moment. I went to bed at midnight last night hoping to get a decent sleep. It’s not like when I was a teenager and I wasn’t trying, just wanting to stay up all night to chat to friends or whatever.
Signal	It all started in January, and most of the time I would sleep fine taking my medication (clonozopam, started taking in March) but other times I still jolt out of the pre-sleep stage and when that happens I become incredibly anxious and worry that something is wrong with me. Can anyone relate, medication or no? It isn't helping me move forward with improving my sleep associated anxiety..
NotSignal	This night, every time I go to bed and about to fall asleep I wake up. It’s been going on for 6 fucking hours. I tried everything like switching bed sides or taking an hour off to relax before going to bed. Now it’s 5:30 in the morning. What should I do?
NotSignal	Me: Has 3 days in a row of blissful sleep,thinks I might become one those people that sleeps effortlessly.Bedbugs:Watch me ruin this man's whole life
NotSignal	I’ve noticed the first full sleep after getting near zero hours for a couple days straight isn’t exactly perfectly refreshing. I can function 100 times better than before and I’m not a zombie, but the waking up is never comfortable. I always have a major headache, my body aches, and I generally feel like crap. Do any of you experience something similar?
Signal	I've had insomnia for the past 8 years and I am still trying to find ways to actually get to sleep. Now I have a nightmare disorder as is, but have discovered last night nyquil and melatonin combo makes absolutely terrifying ones. Anyone know any methods that won't make me even more psychologically screwed up?
NotSignal	Does anybody else have the same thing I have tension in the lower jaw also and ever sense I have really bad time
Signal	I was diagnosed with Infant Insomnia at birth and I've had it for the last 22 years, it's hereditary and my father had the exact same thing as did my grandfather.As weird as it sounds their Insomnia suddenly disappeared at the age of 20 and my Doctor said it's likely I would experience the same thing.When I hit 20 I was disappointed to see no changes, but then a year ago when I hit 21 it suddenly disappeared for me too. I was sceptical of jumping to conclusions and thought it would come back, but since then I no longer spend 2 to 3 hours trying to sleep, it takes me 10 - 15 minutes and I sleep better than ever. I'm pretty confident in saying I no longer have it.My productivity is up, my health is up, I feel better as a whole.I'm posting this because I know what a struggle Insomnia is, don't ever give up. I simply waited it out and beat it.(Never took supplements or pills, didn't take any treatment whatsoever. I only experimented with meditation and it made it worse)
Signal	I've had insomnia for several years. You DON'T deal with it, I've tried everything. Please don't give me the typical \[insert "have you tried this"\] question, I have tried virtually everything. And I have FUCKING DREAMS. I want to do so much in life, I'm still so young. I can't fucking exercise, I can't study, I can't think, I'm just a dysfunctional being at this point. And the worst part is that I can never do anything with these dreams I have. I remember my primary school teacher talking about how tough it is being the prime minister, because they only have time for 7 hours of sleep. I HAVEN';T FUCKINGG GOTTEN 7 HOURS OF SLEEP IN LITERAL YEARS. I WISH I COULD BE EXAGGERATING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I'M STILL ALIVE.I have fucking read all these articles, browsing pharmaceutical stores like I'm looking for a god damn Ferrari. I try to be productive, then my body gets stressed. I try to take breaks or just give up on my goals, then I get stressed. The absence of my efforts stress me and my efforts stress me. I am fucking mentally capable of dealing with this, my stubborn body just won't sleep. I'm fucking convinced any one of you bitches who recommend to "count sheep" and that other bullshit would literally go insane in my circumstances. The only reason I'm still sane enough to rant is because my dreams are too precious to give up on, BUT THEY ARE THE REASON I'M SUFFERING IN THE FIRST PLACE.I've seen so many articles on insomnia I could get a fucking degree. I don't want to eat, I don't want to do anything. I want to love life but I'm being reminded EVERY FUCKING SECOND ON HOW SHIT IT IS.And you know what fucking sucks? You know what hurts so much? When you have to uphold an ideal, even if it means other people distrusting you. When my parents come to check up on me sleeping, I am sincerely FUCKING TRYING 100% to get some shut-eye. Then they fucking walk up to me in the morning professing about how I slept like a log, I FUCKING REMEMBER EVERY MOVEMENT AND STEP OF YOU WHEN YOU ENTERED MY ROOM. And the fucking birds, the washing machine, my family's fucking noises, I hate it all. I've hit a post-nut clarity except I'm only capable of rational thoughts of hatred. Please, please, can someone just beat the fuck out of me and let me enter a coma. Can I just get amnesia or something and reset everything in my life. Can I just be a baby again? Lord, why do you give me these feelings just so I experience pain?
Signal	Some evenings I get anxious without any apparent reason. Then I start thinking about how hard it's going to be to fall asleep with this anxiety. Obviously when trying to fall asleep later, I can't. Last night was one of the worst ones I ever had. 2 nights ago I slept fine which made me feel like I might be able to beat this shit soon. Then yesterday evening I got increasingly more anxious before going to bed without any clear thoughts why I'm getting anxious. Couldn't sleep until 3 in the morning, took some benzos to fall asleep until 8am at least. Still feel like shit today obvsly.How do you guys deal with this anxiety when not being able to fall asleep? I do feel no anxiety during the day. Actually I'm pretty high functioning as an athlete that trains up to 13 hours a week. It just builds up some/most days the closer I get to bed time. And at some point, when I notice that I can't fall asleep today, it's like a gun goes off with steadily increasing anxiety ("What's wrong with me? What am I gonna do now? Will I ever be able to beat this? ..."). I think for now I have to take some meds whenever I feel that it's one of those anxious evenings, as taking sleeping meds at 3 in the morning is a horrible thing to do. Even though taking sleeping meds is not so easy anymore since I've built up quite a tolerance for mirtazapine, which was awesome in the beginning. But I could try taking it on those bad days again I guess after a 3 week break, maybe the tolerance has somewhat reset. Any experiences on tolerance reset with mirtazapine as well?
Signal	Hey everyone, I really need some advice. I’ve been struggling with insomnia for about two weeks now like I never have before. Some back story: a few months ago I found out my hypothyroidism switched to hyper and since then I’ve been off my medication trying to get levels right. I got my levels tested a few weeks ago and my t3 and t4 are now normal but my tsh is still >0.01. My doctor said no treatment is needed and we’ll retest in two months. I contacted him about this insomnia and he told me it could be from my thyroid but to take melatonin for a little. I’ve been taking either 2.5 mg or 5mg and it does nothing. Other sleeping aids aren’t helping. I work out, eat healthy, drink tea before bed and nothing seems to help. I can fall asleep pretty easy but then I wake up and then keep waking up every hour. Then around 2am I can’t fall back asleep. I usually fall asleep around 4am and get up around 7:30am. I’m really at a loss. I’m tired during the day and get headaches. I look like I’m sleep deprived. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Does anyone have any advice?
Signal	Sup. My circadian rhythm is fucked. I nap in the day. I work from home so I do that and fuck my self. Now I’m here. Chilling. Can’t sleep. Sup.
NotSignal	I can't post links as it gets auto removed but you can find it on youtube by typing sporadic fatal insomnia, in that video the mans health rapidly deteriorated by the end of the video he was so far gone, He stopped sleeping, he was in constant motion and he could no longer talk anymoreJust wanna point out that real case shows sporadic fatal insomnia progresses fast anyone who thinks they have it you'd be like that man, You wouldn't be on here you'd be very unwell like he was
NotSignal	Firstly my sleeps got mildly better but it’s absolute SHITE. This tablet has worked well in the past but not really much anymore. Think a benzo is better as I can feel my jaw clench every morning and nightmares so I’m guessing anxiety at the moment. But also I’ve had this for years but everytime I take zopiclone I get into a state where a focus on tiny irrelevant details and have to repeat. It’s very much like ocd. The details are words or things or ideas or theories my brain has to go over and over several times. Mental checking and repeating. Does anybody else get this?
NotSignal	if you see this please pray for me (or whatever you do.) i have a one month old baby and she sleeps pretty well but i get woken up early in the mornings and i am so sleep deprived. my insomnia isnt as bad as usual right now because my body is just so exhausted but i haven't been able to take a nap in weeks because of anxiety. i just took 3 unisom so hopefully i will be able to today...
NotSignal	It’s the first day of the new semester tomorrow and even my ptsd medication won’t knock me out. I’m so anxious. Ugh.
Signal	I've had anxiety problems for as long as I can remember, but this is the first time it's caused insomnia through the whole night. It sucks. I think I have caffeine sensitivity but the cup I had was at noon. I hope this is not a beginning to some new problems, as my anxiety was generally improved otherwise in my life. I wonder if the quarantine messing up my life schedule has added stressors that I'm unaware of. Anyone else?
Signal	I've had chronic insomnia for about five years now, and I'm a 23 yo female. Ive basically tried every prescription drug out there that is used for insomnia and I have to say, my body honestly does not react well to daily consumption of any drug. Seroquel was definitely the most helpful, but after about five weeks of taking it, my insomnia is back and the seroquel is giving me depression, low sex drive, headaches, etc. I want to stop taking it, but I'm worried I will have horrible insomnia once I do. Anyone have recs? I was thinking of trying magnesium.
NotSignal	I’ve never had insomnia like this before. Last night I just could not get comfortable in bed and didn’t end up getting any sleep at all.Now tonight I haven’t been able to sleep at all either. I don’t know what’s going on, it seems so out of the blue. It’s 4:11am. I’ve been lying here since 10pm and still I can’t sleep. I’m in the verge of a breakdown here. I just want to sleep.
NotSignal	i’m quarantining with my bf, who falls asleep in about 15 minutes. i’ve been trying to sleep for four hours and i’ve gotten nowhere. i love him and i want to stay in bed with him, but i’ve been moving to the couch in order to fall asleep a few nights a week. has anyone found a way to fall asleep with others???? i’m desperate
Signal	Hey guys. Just wondering if anyone here has tried CBT for insomnia and has it worked?I have been on a cocktail of medications for sleep since 2011 when I suffered my first manic episode and was hospitalized. If you know anything about mania, it causes severe insomnia. I remember being up for a couple of days straight and then when I did sleep it was only for an hour or two with crazy nightmares. It took a while to come out of that episode and get my sleep back on track and the only way I was able to do it was to take a bunch of medications. I guess you could say I just got hooked on sleeping meds. Anytime I tried to come off them I couldn't sleep.Currently, I am on 7.5mg of mirtazipine and I also take melatonin for sleep. I am trying to get off the mirtazipine for many reasons. I am trying to get off of sleeping pills all together. But as I feared, it's 2:30 am and I can't sleep. I'm not really worried about not sleeping because it's Friday and I don't have anything to do tomorrow. I'm just not tired.I'm determined to get off these pills. So, CBT? Will it work?
Signal	Hi, just tried Melatonin a few days Ago, for people with insomnia do you Build up toleranse against it cuz just a small dosage worked on me and ive tried diffterent sleep meds within my work area allows but melatonin worked better i feel.
NotSignal	Does anyone else experience a headache the day after a decent nights rest? Or, is it only an after effect of taking melatonin?
NotSignal	Hi, first time using this reddit page. i'm a 21 year old guy who has been struggling a lot this year with anxiety, especially insomnia. I've always had issues with sleep in the past but nothing too extreme, i barely even worried about how much sleep i got before until this year. At the very start of this year i remember having a really bad panic attack, which caused me not to sleep for 5/6 days straight until i decided to just drink myself to sleep. Ever since this happened i have struggled a lot with sleep but it mostly happens when i am anticipating an event or responsibility the following day. An example would be arranging plans to meet up with a girl for a date, as soon as i have made these plans i get worried about not sleeping. This happened last week & even though i tried to convince myself i'd be fine & there's nothing to worry about, i didn't get a single second of sleep. I would lay there for hours & hours & every time i felt myself drifting off it's like a huge panic/electric shock type of feeling would stop me from falling asleep. I ended up turning up to the date looking & feeling like a zombie. I've also been out of work for most of this year & i'm petrified of starting a new job because i think i'll end up not sleeping at all due to the responsibility & anticipation and end up getting fired straight away for being terrible. I understand there's people out there who have it much worse & i'm sorry if i come across like i'm over-reacting but to me this feels like such a huge barrier in my life right now, it feels like i can't arrange anything at all because i know i'll not sleep for it which will ruin the experience for me. It's like my brain is trying to sabotage everything for me. And i'm really fearful that this will never stop & life will always be like this so i guess that's why i'm venting on here to see if it does get better. If anyone has any sort of advice or similar experiences then feel welcome to share. It's worth noting that i did smoke weed for a few years before quitting towards the end of last year, so maybe the insomnia/anxiety comes from stopping? but i'm not sure. I would be open to trying any sort of medications, techniques or watching any videos on improving this situation. Thankyou for reading.
Signal	When I first started taking ritalin, I was worried it would aggravate my insomnia. Strangely, the higher dose I take, the better I sleep at night. And now I'm realizing if I take my afternoon dose later, I also sleep through the night more solidly. Anyone experience this?
Signal	I’ve tried taking melatonin occasionally but never have consistently. I’ve taken from 5mg to 25mg and never noticed a difference. It feels no different if I didn’t take any at all. My problem is waking up many times through the night
NotSignal	Why do I feel so gross, sweaty and sticky when I wake up. Even if I slept a good amount. I feel like so smelly too and my eyes are like stuck together. It's a very unpleasant feeling
Signal	I see people here saying they toss and turn but I don’t have that problem. I can fall asleep ASAP (usually around 10), but have been waking up around 3:30-4:00 for the past 6 months now. With very rare days that I’ll get 6+ hours of sleep. I’ve started taking magnesium pills and only drink one cup of coffee at like 5AM, no soda, energy drinks etc.
Signal	I’m so sorry if this is not the right place to post this but I’m so desperate for sleep I caved on taking the sleeping pills again, forgetting that I just took some Gaviscon about half an hour ago. I looked online and can’t find any issues with mixing the two, but now I’m kind of freaking out. This will really help my sleep for sure 😪
Signal	Insomnia makes my life a living hell, and even if I overcome a relapse, the anxiety of having a relapse still remains, leading to a cycle of relapses.I don't know why I ask this, probably to give myself just some small bit of hope that my anxiety can one day be eased? But is there just a teeny, tiny small chance that there is a permanant cure for insomnia.Or maybe there already is, I don't know.
Signal	I have that orange screen shader app that was supposed to help ease my eyes in the evening and make the backlight on my phone less harsh in the middle of the night.At 6am my mind was still racing so much that I started scrolling. I know it's bad but I'm staying with family right now so there's nothing else for me to do and nowhere to go. I just wanted to distract myself enough to get away from the anxiety spiral. Now it's 8am and I just turned it off because fuck it. I'm giving up. Clearly I'm not sleeping tonight. Hoping for better tomorrow.
Signal	Dissociation- Lack of REM- Interrupted Sleep- Daytime Sleep- Hypnic JerkAll in the span of a week- Melatonin doesn’t work- Anxiety mess don’t work- Relaxing doesn’t workDo I need brain surgery?For example: if I got to Sleep now, I’ll just wake up at 3pm
NotSignal	I’ve had bouts of insomnia and seem to always wake between 2am-4am which is impacting my health a lot. I read somewhere that this may be a Liver issue. It need a level of glucose to operate properly. So a cocktail of 1/2 cup of Orange juice, tartar sauce, and salt seems to help a lot of people. I may well at least try this.Since the OJ would be 12 carbs, I wonder if there is a replacement for that would do the same job supplying some glucose? (I am on Keto so keeping carbs low).
Signal	I’m headed off to work after only getting a half hour of sleep. Meds don’t work and I can’t call in because I already have a write up for two call ins in the past two months which were due to insomnia making me feel sick. I guess it’s up to redbull to save the day again, although yesterday I had a huge can and a coffee and I was still tired af, instead it just gave me a racing heart and increased anxiety.Insomnia is a frustrating disorder to have. And most people don’t get it, or they tell me how they only got 6 hrs of sleep and they are tired or they treat me like I’m exaggerating. I literally went to sleep at 9pm and woke up at 930pm and have been up since then. Now time to run to the bus to make it to work as a fucking janitor. I’m an artist but I can’t ever seem to get my shit together because the lack of sleep fucks everything up in my life. My goal is just to stay sane enough to keep the panic attacks away but it’s getting harder everyday. I hope someday this will just go away and I can sleep like a healthy person.
NotSignal	Listen before I start this I take what I say with a grain of salt and humor because I know things could be worse I’m not in the most messed up situation but it sucks man.Remember this 18 male.Enter June 3rd schools out and I basically become a high school senior, great congrats yeah yeah, so I stay up that night I’m talking no sleep and I look myself in the mirror and say “ oh no no no no no no, no not like last summer and one before and the other one before that one and NO” but if you couldn’t guess it ended up being the exact same, video games at night then self talk shen I’m tired (in my head) hey let’s jerk off? Yeah fuck yeah we did it 2 hours ago but why not I’m not even horny let’s just do it OK! You know what tho GTA5 isn’t gonna play it self Oh oh okay you got my dick out and decide to play game fuck you then. Yeah that’s the type of shit me and me do ok... anyways so basically no sleep until 3-6am and I’m up at 9-11 my parents are lean on me it’s summer what the hell no plans no care really why the hell would I care anyways aren’t I supposed to rebel against all things like go get 4 tattoos 6 piercings and a girlfriend who dates me only because I’m getting street Cred, well I decided fuck dating I want tattoos and I only like piercings on girls noses I find that cute unless she’s a total whore then it’s just like women I could rip it out! I could! Don’t fucking fuck my friends! Anyways no no no back on track man, so I can’t fucking sleep I live my night as if it’s the day part2 “private mode” ya see I may be 18 but that doesn’t mean I’m free. Under this roof they don’t care what I do as long as I don’t express my self much and do as I’m told including not working because “it’s complicated” oh man I could unpack all this shit but I don’t want to because what the hell I don’t trust people like that , anyways I’m looking for help or something words of advice anything but hate fuck you and goodbye with you’re hateful bigotry fucking shit Reddit I’m sick of hate. ANYWAYS, I did fall asleep on the toilet mind you I’m a male and took a piss I guess I sat down sometime and slept this was a week ago, anyways man hey good luck reading this garbage I hope you’re all doing well
NotSignal	Every night I just go to sleep and wake up after five hours and can't fall back to sleep afterwards. Then in the afternoon I feel like my eyelids are anvils, I'm just consumed by the urge to dose off.
NotSignal	The use of sleeping pills in the US has grown by 60% in the last two decades. People not sleeping means big business. And your business should be getting a good night’s sleep so you can get to the business of tomorrow.

NotSignal	Hey guys so I had sleeping troubles a couple of weeks ago which started to get better however, I noticed that I never feel tired. I can close my eyes even though I’m wide wide awake but in 20-30 mins I’ll be asleep. Even if I sleep 5 hours I’m not tired.I normally do wake up on the night though and the same thing happens. Not tired but if I close my eyes and think about something in 20 mins I’ll be asleep.The feeling of sleepiness is never there, is this okay?
Signal	So apparently I dozed but now here I am @530am still scrolling through Reddit. Anxiety is gone for now as my brain has turned into mush.
Signal	Got no sleep. Feel like I’m high on something haha. In the past, I feel this “high” for a couple hours and then just get more tired. Feel like I have less anxiety because I don’t have the energy to worryWho else experiences a “high”?
NotSignal	Hey everyone, i'm 18F and up until recently, have never in my life dealt with the troubles of insomnia. I'm very much a night owl, and i find myself most productive in the solaced hours of the late night. This has greatly affected my ability to fall asleep around 2-3am when i finally lay down in bed and start to get anxious about the mere 4h i have to sleep before having to wake up for school at 7am. Over the past few weeks especially, i find myself unable to still my mind even though i'm greatly fatigued mentally and physically. It almost feels as though my consciousness and my body are at war and in the midst of closing my eyes to try to fall sleep, i become acutely aware of the fact that i am still very much awake and somehow that hinders me from going to sleep. There is this persisting sense of inner unrest as the awareness of time slipping by registers within my mental space, inhibiting me from falling into that complete deep sleep i was once so fond of. I'd really truly appreciate it if someone here can share a similar experience and perhaps even how they got through it? :) I'm also not looking to consume any drugs to help with my sleep, as i'm opposed to its potential side effects and generally want to try to resolve this in the most natural way possible.Thank you so much for your help, have the best week ahead!
Signal	Every time someone brings up my insomnia I always tell them it’s hell and they should be grateful for their ability to switch off in a couple of minutes. God, where did it all go wrong.
NotSignal	I cannot sleep at all today. I've done a lot of research during this 8-9 hour period figuring out the causes. Whenever I sleep my heart beats fast and I keep getting this random pauses in my heart I'm not really sure how to explain it but it definitely leaves me shocked and having a fast heart rate. Previously I've been only taking strepsils for the fears of the covid19 virus to which it did said that alcohol might affect? I'm not sure I've taken lozenges but I've followed the guide lines every 2-3 hours though I didn't really have a sore throat only that I felt a little under the weather and as well now I'm having a little trouble breathing. I suppose it comes from my allergic rhinitis. My nose inside of my nose is like itchy it's so damn annoying everything is building up.My main cause of concern is my heart and my breathing. I'm not sure if I can call it a heart palpitation I think it's most likely that? In any way please help me. Anything. I'm not sure about going to the doctor. Here in the Philippines healthcare especially with the rise of the virus may lead me to getting and contracting deadlier diseases in the Hospital... i just want to sleep in peace. I hope it's all pshylogical? Anxiety? But I've been getting this frequently for the entire night... 9 hours straight. I've been doing all kinds of positions to sleep... I looked at the mirror my eyes only under my eyes were red and that scared the crap out of me. Am I internally bleeding right now or something?! What's even happening. When I try to force myself to sleep my heart rate speeds up and it gets really uncomfortable and I feel maybe a little something on my chest. Right now I don't feel sleepy. It's so weird. But I'm definitely tired and needing sleep. Half sleepy half awake. I've had previous after the death of my father of increased heart rate but It was for a short time and I was able to sleep. This time it's different. I really think this has something to do with the strepsils... My biggest fear is the entire build up of everything. The covid 19 virus(idk), allergic rhinitis, asthma, pneumonia, I have a little cough but it's not bad at all like it's white not yellow ish, the increased heart rate, the shortness of breath, I feel a little something on my left side, Oh I get a left headache as well only the specific left side of my head. Plus my sleep deprivation. I also did body weight training my body's sore. I weigh about 70kg 5'6. I fear that all of this combined only leads to a recipe of disaster... Please help.
Signal	Hi im suffering with dp/dr since 5 to 6 weeks since i had a panic attack and have depression. My sleep was always not the best but the last weeks are HELL! I cant feel my body anymore and its making me so so anxious. I feel tired and exhausted and my eyes are burning but when i close my eyes there is this feeling of my body is not here, its difficult to describe & a very strange phenomenon. It feels like my body has no weight at all and im floating.. when i close my eyes i see nothing but black, no visions no dream kind of state. I cant do this anymore please if somebody knows what can give me my sleep back and relieve this symptoms text me. Thank you
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for as long as I can remember (I’m 25) and the past 6 years have been the worst ever.I get so little sleep (1-2 hours a night if I manage to fall asleep) that I now at night time unintentionally say to myself ”I’m so tired, I need to go rest now.” instead of sleep. 😒
NotSignal	Every single night I wake up around 3am and can never fall back asleep. I used to never be able to fall asleep until 3am or much much later, but now it’s the other way around.Can anyone else relate?
Signal	I literally haven’t been able to sleep for over 2 months since the stress of the virus and quarantine. I have went 3 days without sleeping even 1 hour because I physically can’t fall asleep. I can’t even make up for not being able to sleep during the day as I CANT NAP!!! Is anyone in the same position ? I can literally only fall asleep with Zoplicone plz help. I’m extremely tired during the day also yet I can’t fall asleep :( worried it’s sfi
NotSignal	Hi, I am interested in starting CBT-I, and I have been trying to record my sleep for a few days. The hard part is not knowing whether I am awake or asleep at night. Sometimes during nocturnal awakenings, I am awake enough to check the time so I can record it in my journal. It's hard to estimate how long it takes to fall asleep because my brain goes from racing thoughts to unconsciousness and I'm not aware of how long that takes. Is it bad to check the time in order to understand how much I am actually awake? I think I have a hyperarousal issue because I never feel sleepy at any time of the day and my heart and brain are constantly racing. Will CBT-I help someone who is suffering from sleep state misperception/paradoxical insomnia?
Signal	anything that works for you? I have to work some nights at my job when I usually do days and that screws me up a lot. last time i couldn't sleep for a week I felt like I was gonna die and I'm worried it will be like that again. thinking I might just go to the doctors for sleep meds
NotSignal	I stay all day on the scholl tired and wanting so bad to sleep, but when I arrive and try to sleep, my mind go full of thoughts, further after I starting writing a novel for fun and when I try to sleep I just have thousands of ideas to write, is it relatable to anyone? I just can sleep well on the weekends (sorry for any english mistake, not native speaker)
NotSignal	I had a nightmare the other night and it ended in me actually biting my boyfriend. I started crying after, but he didn't notice thankfully. He was confused when he woke up and thought it was a very new sexual kink he didn't know of. I searched it up and the internet says "an early sign of deadly illnesses."I work night shift so my sleep habits aren't consistent. That could be it. I'm also extremely depressed and have been more deeply since I went on night shift which could be another factor. Anyone experience acting out your dreams? I woke up after I started panicking and actually physically bit him.
NotSignal	I'm looking to see if anyone else has experienced like a sudden worsening in their insomnia/sleep disorder?I've had sleeping disorders since I was maybe 7/8 possibly younger (I'm 21 now) and for most of my life it has been insomnia but I have also had a couple periods of hypersomnia. I've found in the last few weeks my insomnia has gotten a lot worse I'm only getting maybe 2-4 hours at best or not sleeping at all and I'm really only able to sleep during the day it's near impossible at night. Has anyone else experienced something like this or can give advice on how to tackle it?
Signal	For the past 2-3 weeks I suddenly have only been sleeping every other night. One night I cant sleep no matter what I do but the next night I sleep fine because of how tired I am from not sleeping the other night. It started happened so suddenly. The nights that I cant sleep I try taking Melatonin but it does nothing even when I take 11 Melatonin pills at once and even when I feel really tired I cant sleep after laying in bed trying to sleep for up to 5-6 hours. What is happening to me? It has really impacted my plans.
NotSignal	Anyone tried these with any success? I've seen a few apps along with a few on youtube but they are all geared toward meditation. Some look like psychedelic tunnels, etc. Most are set to music which I would mute, don't like noise when trying to sleep. The tunnel ones cause vertigo for me even just previewing them. I don't want anyone "guiding" me...again, I want silence . Just looking for something you can watch that will make the lids heavy....TIA!
Signal	well i fell asleep fine but my dogs started barking at absolutely nothing at 4am. so i lay there for like an hour or maybe even more and my body’s stupid caveman “me must watch tribe” instincts kick in. so here i am, not even tired, feeling like shit ( i didn’t even get much sleep yesterday ). 3 hours of sleep let’s goooo
Signal	It's been more than a week with a poor sleep. It came back just like the last summer. I hope it will be fixed soon because i am really tired of it.
NotSignal	Early morning around 4am I wake up due to cold. Its due to my face and arms exposed.When i wrap my body around the blanket i dont get cold.What are my options?1. Temperature control in room2. Cover face and wear clothes which covers arms.3. Cover your body and sleep.Let me know if you have better ideas.
Signal	My PCP just prescribed me Trazadone, which is an SSRI but used off-label to treat insomnia. Has anyone had any experience with this stuff? Any input would be great! I hear the most common side effect is headache/migraine and constipation.
NotSignal	I’ve been working nothing but nights so I’m like wired after work and then I end up sleeping throughout the day because I have nothing else to do and it’s not even on purpose I’ll pass out in bed yet I’ll fall asleep at like 12 and wake up at 3
NotSignal	Because I feel like insomnia is going to ruin mine ,don't they say not sleeping makes you look 9 years older than your actual age
Signal	Fuck me I’m exhausted, but here I am again, unable to sleep and watching the night slip away minute by minute.
NotSignal	Anyone else ever been so sleep deprived and tired, they wanted to physically knock them out in the hopes they'd get some rest? Is that just me?
NotSignal	I don’t sleep many hours, I’m just curious as to how many hours you guys sleep because I’m having my doubts whether I actually have insomnia or I’m just dumb.
Signal	I'm glad an insomnia subreddit exists, but even then, I am not sure if any of you will believe my story. Please keep in mind I am not exaggerating anything in the slightest. I have had insomnia literally my whole life. Throughout my life, my insomnia progressively got worse. By the time I was 18, I could no longer sleep without sleep medication. A few months after that point, regular sleep medication couldn't put me to sleep anymore. I was prescribed seroquel, which so far, is the only thing that can put me to sleep. Seroquel has literally been keeping me alive for the past 6 or so years. Without it, I literally can't sleep to save my own life. I haven't had a nap in 6 years. I can't get a single second of sleep without seroquel. I have read countless stories about how sleep hygiene has cured someone's insomnia, and I scoff every time I read such cases. No amount of sleep hygiene could ever do me any good. My psychiatrist recommended I do a sleep study, which I want to do, but can't due to the current Covid-19 outbreak caused lockdown. My insomnia is so bad it literally couldn't get any worse. I wouldn't be surprised if sleep medicine doctors can't do anything to help me. I wouldn't be surprised if invasive brain surgery was the only possibility for me. I am a biological anomaly that can't sleep without enough sleep medication to kill a child. My insomnia is severe enough to be featured on a documentary. To say that my insomnia is severe is an understatement. Were it not for sleep drugs, I would be dead right now. Most people don't believe me when I tell them how severe my insomnia is. My insomnia is orders of magnitude worse than any of you on here. Normal insomnia is chump change in comparison to mine. The brain mechanism that allows a normal human to sleep seems to be absent in me. It is like I am literally missing a part of my brain. I hope at least a few of you will take me seriously.
Signal	My doc just prescribed me this for sleep, I’ve been in some pain recently and my insomnia started as kind of a vicious cycle of discomfort and anxiety about sleeping, plus going cold turkey off weed. I got a month’s worth of mirtazapine and took my dose last night around 12:30 am. Went to bed and still hadn’t fallen asleep by 3. I went to my couch to hang for a bit and I think I slept out there for an hour (I was still anxious after taking this sedative antidepressant ...). Did a dropper of CBD oil. Went back to my bedroom and I think I slept a few more hours. I’m going through weed withdrawal right now, was a heavy smoker for a while but quit recently because it was causing me more anxiety. Is this normal? Will nothing touch this insomnia until my body regulates without the weed? Should I try the sleeping pill again? I wonder if me being worried about whether it was gonna work for me before taking it is also part of the issue :(
NotSignal	I've suffered from insomnia for years, but since being locked up 24/7 in quarantine my insomnia has been worse. Listening to sounds a night time, I find relaxes my mind. Does anyone else do the same?Ocean Sounds: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4i7jDRNc5o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4i7jDRNc5o)
Signal	I take Saturdays and Sundays “off” from ambien but I still have trouble falling asleep. I can’t tell if this is because of the meds or if I’m just anxious, in the past I haven’t had trouble on my off days. I’ve only been on it a couple weeks, could I be building a dependence that fast??? Please let me know your experiences
Signal	This is mostly just a vent post. I get very broken sleep and lately I’m lucky to get to sleep at all. I’m so fucking tired all the time but at the end of the day I lay in bed staring at my ceiling for hours until my brain shuts the fuck up long enough to nap for an hour or so. I’m late to work and school every single day because I’m so tired in the morning. I’m scared of sleeping meds because I have a history of abusing them. Just really worn out these days.
NotSignal	I have a problem which is that I get tired, feel tired, and have no trouble falling asleep, and have a godd night sleep and all, but I don't see the point in sleeping anymore... I have kinda made a self diagnosis (I know that you shouldn't but I can't manage to find help or go somewhere) and I think I have depression. And I have absolutley no idea if this problem is due to depression or if it even is insomnia, because I can't find the joy in almost anything anymore and I feel kinda num tbh. It is currently 4:00 AM in the morning as I am writing this, and I feel tired, but just don't want to sleep because I can't see the point. I have recently also gone for midnight walks like yesterday I went on a one hour walk from 3:45 - 4:45 in the morning because I use it as an coping mechanism. But this is just new territory and I have no idea why this is?I am very sorry if this is badly written but with a 15 y/o 4:00 AM in the morning what can you expect ;D? Thanks for reading and I wish you all a great day! :D
NotSignal	I'm currently trying to take a nap at 6pm right now and I keep getting these burning sensation in my stomach, it's like when your hungry and your stomach acid starts burning intensely and you feel it. Also I get wide spread body twitching which has been happening for 2 months now and was one time convinced I had ALS or MS. When I am trying to sleep suddenly my stomach would star heating again. Its scaring me, I will eat and see if it's just because I am hungry
Signal	I've had a Immovane for 15 years and having been using them on as needed basis. Typically I would use them for as long as I needed them — one night, one week or one month — and then go off of them. This worked well for me.I've been going through ridiculous levels of stress the past four years and as a result I've been on them continuously for the sake of getting sleep. Lack of sleep was not one more thing I needed to deal with and the Immovane worked great. But now it's time to go off of them. My dosage is 3.5 mg per night.I know I won't be able to sleep and I figure it will be several weeks with the first week being the worst. Any suggestions how to get through the next week?
NotSignal	Hello, I’m just looking for some advice from people who’ve perhaps recovered or have found some sort of solution. I’ve had insomnia my entire life (24yr) it’s been a regular occurrence for me to go 48 or 72 hours with no sleep at all, and this goes back as fair as I can remember. Anyway I’ve been prescribed various medications since 14 but most of been anti depressants and psychotics which have only really made matters worse. I’ve used other chemicals and plants over the years and it seems as though I have to ‘pass out’ to get to sleep; this obviously isn’t the the route I want to take so I stopped this and started doing a lot of yoga and meditation, as well as full body shut downs etc. Making sure I’m eating well and waking up and sleeping at the same time. But in all honestly this helps with the stress of not sleeping but doesn’t help me sleep. I don’t know whether to go back to medicating, which I really don’t want to. I feel as though sleeping is a joke that everyone else understands and I don’t get. It’s as though my mind just won’t turn off, even if I’m exhausted. Just wondered if anyone has any advice as it’s truly controlling my life and having tackled a lot of other health issues it’s as though the insomnia is the last bridge before I can finally function on a normal sober level, which I am desperate to achieve. I’m sorry for all the words and any advice would be hugely appreciated. Also if it helps I lucid dream is full colour every time I sleep, sometimes I remember the dreams fully other times just the emotions but that’s exhausting within itself.
NotSignal	Been awake since 6am on 3/10/2020 and it’s now 3:34am on 3/11/2020 am counting
Signal	For nearly 2 years I haven't been able to sleep for more than 5 hours a night, typically getting around 3-4. This was due to living arrangements and work requirements, both of which I've amended in an effort to better look after myself.While 3-5 hours of sleep a night leaves me exhausted, I'm used to it. Over the past month I've been extending that and I'm now consistently up to 6.5-7 hours a night, aiming for a solid 8.I'm feeling better in some ways, the biggest impact is in my appearance. I look less like someone lingering between the living and the dead and more like a healthy individual. What I have noticed though is I'm feeling much more tired and exhausted than I've ever felt before. I expected a period of recovery, but this is extreme. I've been researching what I can but I'm not really sure what I'm looking for and haven't found anything as to why I'm feeling even more exhausted after getting more sleep consistently.I've consulted my GP and all they have to offer is that this might be some kind of recovery.Does anyone here have any experience similar to this?
Signal	I’ve taken Tylenol pm almost every night for over the past decade and trying to find an alternative. I’ve tried valerian root, melatonin and they keep me awake. Does anyone have any suggestions?
NotSignal	The program is called Sleep for life created by Sasha Stephens and it has helped me be motivated this past few nights. Go and check it out his might also help you as well. (This program is a self medication program so if you're determined of getting rid of your insomnia by yourself and stop wasting money on doctors this might be the best for you.)
NotSignal	Researchers at UCLA are recruiting adults (ages 18 or older) residing in California, who are currently using different kinds of cannabinoids to help with insomnia symptoms, for a phone interview.Our goal is to understand more about dosing, tolerability, and effects of use of different kinds of cannabinoids (e.g., THC, CBD, CBN, CBG, etc.) for insomnia symptoms in adults.If you volunteer to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete a phone interview lasting approximately 45 minutes. The interview will include questions about your demographics, mental health and medical history, tobacco, alcohol and caffeine use, overall sleep functioning, insomnia symptoms, patterns of cannabinoid use, including type, amount, frequency, and timing of use, effectiveness for insomnia, and side effects. Upon completion, you will be emailed a $50 Amazon gift card code for your participation.If you are interested in participating, please email Emily Ricketts, PhD and clearly list the name of the study along with a good call-back number to reach you.ERicketts@mednet.ucla.edu
NotSignal	I’m still as wide awake as I was at the start of my sleep window. I got in and out of bed a few times, but not that much. I didn’t see the point because I felt calm in bed. Thing is , time flies so fast. Went to bed at midnight and I am sure I had a bit of microsleep, then when I decided to get up, it was 2am , Next time I got up the sun was starting to rise (5 am). It’s currently 5:30 and i think I am gonna start my day soon. I just hope next night’s not gonna be the same.
Signal	I've pretty consistently had early morning awakenings the past few months. I know it's a sign of depression, so I've been focusing on that, and my mood has been far better than it's been in quite awhile. But my sleep hasn't improved.My sleep isn't fragmented at all. I just sleep 5-6 hours and then I'm awake. I'm completely dependent on my sleeping pills, so doing something relaxing and trying to get back to sleep later isn't an option for me.What's a good treatment for early morning awakenings?
NotSignal	I've heard that they can help with anxiety so i'd like to try one. I would a cheap ish one just to see if it helps so i can decide whether to invest in a higher quality one. Thanks in advance
NotSignal	What are the most painful problems you currently experience in your personal life because of this issue?
NotSignal	Hey all, not sure this is the right place- I do not have insomnia and my partner does. I’m struggling with schedules and how to parent. With being respectful to both parties so they can get some sleep but I also get some help with our one year old. I’d love to hear from insomniacs that are also parents! If you have any advice or ideas for me.
NotSignal	That's all I've been doing the past week I've ran though so much paper do you guys have this problem it's getting pretty bad I'm drawing to the point it hurts me too but I cannot stop
Signal	I haven't been able to really sleep for the past few weeks. Whenever I start to feel tired or a bit sleepy I usually try to fall asleep but I end up just laying there for hours just tossing and turning trying to get comfortable and when I do fall asleep I end up waking up really early like at around 6 or 7 AM and I don't get the urge to sleep till around 11 or 12 when I'm busy doing stuff with my family. It doesn't really matter what time I go to sleep anymore because I'll still wake up at 6 or 7 AM even if I sleep at around 3 or 4 AM. I don't feel tired when I wake up but when it starts to become noon my body starts to want to shut down and want to fall asleep and if I do find a way to try staying awake so I can try falling asleep at night I'm not tired anymore and I just repeat the cycle. Is there anything I can do to make this feeling go away? I'm 16 btwP.S. Sorry if it's jumbled up or doesn't really make any sense. I haven't really been able to think for the past few days now
Signal	I've been free of insomnia for about a few months now, but today, a problem has arose. I don't know what came over me. But, while I was going about my day and doing my own stuff I suddenly thought about my past experiences with insomnia, and how I got depressed for a period of time because of it.Then I got scared. Then this inescapable anxiety just keeps on building up, preventing me from enjoying things I love to do, as I keep thinking about what I was going to do when night falls.So now it's night time, and I feel like crying from this stupid anxiety build up. I feel like if I worry too much, anixety insomnia will come back again and haunt me, and I don't know when it'd be gone again.This feels like a never ending loop of relapses.
Signal	Hey everyone,I’m going through another day on a zoplicone hangover. 12 years of this shit but my first time on reddit. Last night I had 100mg of trazadone and 2mg of melatonin, fell asleep pretty easily and woke up an hour later and can’t get back to sleep. After 2 hours gave up and took the sleep pill.. This keeps happening. Before the trazadone I couldn’t fall asleep, now I can fall asleep but can’t stay asleep. Somebody give me strength. Lockdown has only made this worse too. Nothing seems to work forever all stops working eventually.
Signal	I took two tylenol pm's and 2.5 mg of melatonin (otc chewable) about a half hour before trying to fall asleep and nothing. The fucking things made me feel really sleepy but no, no sleep at all. Its now like 3 hours later and I'm freaking the fuck out. Only been dealing with this for like a week.
Signal	Just curious I have this problem definitely gotten worse since covid but I can never sleep at night don't get tired or if I do I'm tired then I get in bed and I'm wide awake. I've tried melatonin even drinking or smoking myself to sleep but it seems my body wants me asleep during the day and awake at night. Even if I get a good night's rest I'll just be groggy and not feeling it during the day but as soon as the sun goes down I'm like hell yea time to take over the world. Any advice?
Signal	I have been involved with my SO since 1yr. This is his story4years ago he developed severe anxiety, depression and such bad panick attacks that he couldn't talk to people/function. His insomnia worsened to the point where he couldn't sleep. Things were bad and no medicine worked. My SO always had a strict rule against alchohol because his own father was an abusive alcoholic who drove them to streets. But thos mental health got so bad that he finally broke that rule on the advice of his friend, and took up drinking to manage his anxiety. It helped him sleep and function. He stopped after a point and got clean for a year. But after that, due to several unrelated factors his mental health worsened and he once again couldn't sleep. He started consuming the lightest beer he could find every day so that he could sleep, go to work and maintain a routine. He promised to himself that he would quit beer after 1 year. I think it is now 2years since he has made that commitment. He gave me all this info himself, he is someone who is very idealistic, honest and transparent, in general.So this is what he does. He takes one tab of atarax 25 mg per day and 1 light beer, after which he manages to fall asleep. This helps him keep up a routine so that he can get up and go to work every day. He completely refrains from drinking on weekends(2 full days every week) since he need not sleep or attend office. According to him, the atarax makes him actually sleep but the beer helps him relax psychologically till he can get to the point of being willing to fall asleep. So the alchohol fills a psychological need to be able to relax. Now he claims that his own alchohol use is beginning to worry him. Though he had used alchohol beneficially in the past, he now admits that he is on the verge of being addicted, He had tried to quit alchohol but he claims that he couldn't pull it off and the difference between drinking and not drinking is huge. (As different as sky and earth). Also, he wants to visit a psychiatrist and take up proper anxiolytics since off late he feels a certain tolerance in him to atarax. I asked him if proper anxiolytics would help him deal with anxiety so he could quit drinking, but he became defensive at this point and said no.There has been a lockdown imposed on us since a month and he was forced to refrain completely from alchohol, like 0. But he continues his daily dose of 25 mg atarax. He had "mental meltdowns" in this month, when he wished he had beer. I carefully broached the topic of drinking and asked him very softly if he is able to cope without alchohol. I told him that a healthier alternative could exist and maybe tapering down drinking could be a good idea, moreover alchohol could create tolerance, further addiction and craving and more anxiety from withdrawing from its use. His anxiety in the past month, I suspect, could be induced from going off alchohol. 'I wont tell you what to do, because I am not in your shoes, I am only trying to tell you not to give up on yourself' , I said. 'Whether you must quit or not quit now is something that I cannot tell but dont give up on your health', i said. He became VERY defensive and said that he tried but couldnt stop and that the "price" of refraining from alchohol is huge and makes him suffer SO badly that me telling him to taper or quit feels 'insensitive' to him. I have, never seen him react so defensively, he said that I was MAKING him defensive by 'questioning' him on a sensitive subject and that I am unable to deal with it and that he feels he should no longer talk to me about alchohol. He is better off talking to friends who would 'get' him. "You dont understand addiction at all, you just read stuff online", and that him talking about this topic will further "exacerbate your anxiety and make you miserable" and "talking about it IS the problem it creates conflict". Oaf course, he was wrong and not communicating openly was THE problem. And an honest man like him becoming so uncharacteristically defensive looks like a red flag to me. In fact, it was the first time that, I indirectly implied, in a polite manner if he could consider trying to stop/taper drinking.He apologized later on, after I lashed back, and claimed that he became so sensitive when the subject was brought up that he couldn't understand that I was showing concern. Since the topic makes him anxious, he said that he will bring it up when he is ready and asked me to shelve the topic till thenRedditors who took to alchohol to deal with anxiety, what do you feel would help my SO at this point? If alchohol is bad for him, ONLY he has the power to come to that decision. But what would be a good alternative to a person with anxiety and insomnia? I am scared of anxiolytics like benzos for example, they seem to CREATE dependence and restraint from them creates more anxiety. So anxiolytics seem scary to me. Is it cruel to expect my SO to go cold turkey on alchohol? Does alchohol actually help? Is drinking to sleep a good decision? If not, what else can be done?
NotSignal	I was also in this long hell cycle. Please dont get your self caught in this bullshit. SFI is extremely rare to the point that doctors dont even consider it unless it's so obvious. It's so rare that we dont even have a marker to determine the chances of getting it, take ALS as an example the chances that was set was around like 1 in every 50,000 people. And SFI doesn't even have one, if we were to do the math it would be like 1 in 1,000,000,000 (low balled) 1 in 1 BILLION! Because since it was first officially named, we only had dozens of cases in the past 30 years. Also sleep usually isnt the first symptoms, cases shown that sleep was usually never brought up until end of life. The only time you should worry is if you cant remember who you are and where you are.
Signal	Don't even really have anything to say, I'm just frustrated. I don't have insomnia ( yet, I hope??? ) But this is the best place for this. I've always been a night owl, but it's always been by choice. My main problem when getting bad sleep was that I'd just gone to bed too late, but when I eventually did, I'd sleep. Last week I went to bed like I usually did, and then I just never fell asleep. I must've gotten at max 1 hour sleep, but it could've been zero. That has never happened before and I was frustrated that night but not too worried because I thought it'd just be a one time thing. Day after that, I sleep perfectly again. But then the night after that, I suddenly feel extremely anxious about going to sleep. I can hear my heartbeat speeding in my head, and somehow that noise is extremely loud when you're trying to sleep. Had another sleepless night. And since then, it's gone downhill. It's frustrating because I know the sole and only reason for this is that I've convinced myself I won't be able to sleep, and I've very quickly started to strongly associate sleep with fear. My bed feels like a prison. I just miss the week before that first sleepless night. I'll lie down and close my eyes and my anxiety will freak out, but as soon as I sit up and do something else again I completely calm down. I'm so fucking tired, and I have no idea what to do. I've seen everything about sleep hygiene etc, and I've started to wonder if that makes me even more anxious, because previously all my life I've just gone to sleep. Having new rules and stuff just makes me more aware that I'm preparing for sleep. I can't begin to think what it's like for everyone that has dealt with this for years, it must be super frustrating. I hope that won't be me. Again, I don't have insomnia, and I've basically gotten myself into this, so any tips on how to get myself out of it are greatly appreciated. Thanks!
Signal	I would really like to know if I should go get a diagnosis because Sleep has become impossible for me It got so bad that every night was an all nighter until the sun was rising and then I would sleep for about two hours or not sleep at all, then no matter how exhausted i was by the time night came, I couldn't sleep again, I tried watching tv, I tried just laying in silence and darkness, I tried music, reading, everything. I started taking Unisom to sleep but it stopped working, I took 4 and it still took 4 hours to sleep. I also have ADHD which definently attributesAt this point I'm practically over it, I cant sleep, and when I do it's rare, it's not my sleep schedule, cause if I manage to go to sleep on time, Its guaranteed all nighter the next nightI'm exhausted.
Signal	I cant fall asleep at all... As soon as i am about to lose consciousness i get jolted right back to being awake, like somebody shocked me with electricity (hypnic jerk). It always makes me jerk with my hand or my leg. During the day i have periods when my muscles start to twitch and spasam, usually on my legs, but sometimes on my arms (fasciculations)... I can only go in mid stage of sleep but i dont feel rested at all. As soon as i start fall in deeper stage i would be jolted...It all started one day during quarantine when i overtrained with the two hard workouts. Before going to sleep i did some brething exercices that i usullay do and then i went to bed... Thats when i first experience the jerks. I have been dealing with this for 3 months now and i dont know what to do anymore. I have been to the doctor, checked my blood, and they told me everything was fine with me and its just stress. I tried magnesium, melatonin pills, Gaba pills, fasting but nothing helps.. Its like i have demon inside of me... Please someone help. What should i do?
NotSignal	In the past I’ve probably had insomnia a few times a year, but now it seems to be happening multiple times a week for the past 2 weeks. What could I do?
NotSignal	So i know it is slower to make gains with insomnia and interrupted sleep ofc. But is it possible to make any gains or do i just lose muscle. I get about 6-8h of sleep a night but wake up every 2-3 hours. If anyone suffering from this has made any gains pls let me know!!!
NotSignal	I'm new in this subreddit so can anyone give me good tips on how to fall asleep fast cuz it takes me 30 minutes to fall asleep...
NotSignal	I’m seeing a few sleep doctors and sleep restriction was recommended to me, but before I take the plunge, I wanted to get feedback fromthe community to see if its the right fit for my particular mix of issues. I (really) enjoy hearing the personal stories and find them super instructive on my medical journey to finally get good sleep. I suffer from moderate apnea and early awakening insomnia. My sleep efficiency hovers between 60-80%, and I get around 30-45 minutes of REM, because I wake up early in the morning around 6:30am no matter when I go to bed. Ive had two surgeries to help me breath through my nose (hopefully it’ll work soon) and may be getting more. On the rare days I get lots of REM sleep, it’s sometimes because I was able to sleep in past 8am, even if my sleep is broken up due to apnea (Going to bed earlier in the night doesnt work for me). My question is: has anyone had similar experiences? Should I focus on starting my sleep window to teach my body sleep later than 8am? Do I need to fix my apnea before doing sleep restriction?Any feedback at all is appreciated. Im fortunate to have access to plenty of professionals but my combination of issues makes it difficult for them to treat. Thank you!
Signal	I was prescribed 30 mg Mirtazapine for insomnia. It did knock me out but now it's noon and I still feel numb / high / groggy. If I react like this, is it worth taking the drug, or does it mean I won't tolerate it well anyway?If I feel this incapacitated the next day, it's not much better than having insomnia...
NotSignal	Often times I’ll lay there for hours just thinking about my life, from being a kid ,to now and i just scan/analyze all these little details and memories that have brought me to where I am today. In a sense, its my life flashing before my eyes. I’ll even pick apart how certain events might have had to do with my personality structure/habits/tendencies. I’ll also analyze my current day to day situations, habits, and relationships. Anyone else experience this?
Signal	hi guys, I have been on olanzapine/zyprexa (2.5mg) since September 2019, for insomnia/depression. Accidentally I read about long-term side effects of this medication and I'm very scared . Last night I decided don't take it but I couldn't sleep until 5am, and then I decided take it. I feel so sad being addicted to this medication. Before the prescription, had difficulties to sleep, but now I can't even sleep without it. :'(
Signal	I don’t think this is talked about enough. We have gotten so used to using our phones that it becomes a norm to check your phone every few minutes during the day, before bed, first thing in the morning etc. Then you wake up in the middle of the night... ugh I can’t sleep let me check reddit... on the phone again. I really think this electronic addiction is leading to a lot of insomnia problems and I think many people, including myself, refuse to see how big of a problem it is. Last week I traveled from coast to coast moving relocating from the east to west. I was spending 8 hours a day driving and it was forcing me to phone detox. I was staying in Airbnb’s at night, limited WiFi access, shitty service, and by day 3, I wasn’t having to force myself to resist checking my phone any more. It’s like this long move forced a detox out of me and my brain was slowing back down again. I spent the days just driving with nothing but music and my thoughts. It took me a week to get here and by the end of the trip I was sleeping a consistent, uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep... something that hasn’t happened on consecutive nights in months. I know this is maybe oversimplifying things for most people but being this connected to the device in your hand 24/7 changes the wiring of your brain. It’s not supposed to operate like this. My challenge will be once settled in, back to occasional boredom, can I refrain from over use of the phone because I really do think it is a major trigger and perhaps a cause for insomnia issues.
NotSignal	I was getting my sleep for the past 2 weeks now fir past 2 days I’m waking up every 2 hours again !!!! I’m so frustrated I’m crying 😢
NotSignal	so the title tells that i’ve always been a good sleeper. ever since i was little my parents have made my sibling and i follow a strictish bedtime routine that’s honestly stuck with me up until now, my late teens. i put my phone out of sight at least an hour before i turn my reading light off, and before that, i do at least 30 minutes of yoga. all of this has proved effective in me getting quality sleep, up until now.. for the past week, i’ve had 4 completely sleepless nights. in addition to my bedtime routine, i’ve tried taking magnesium, more melatonin, and i’ve tried breathing exercises, but none seem to work because it seems that i’ve honestly just forgotten how to fall asleep... any advice?
NotSignal	So, i live in a house share and i would like for the people i live with to understand that they shouldnt wake me up when i've finally fallen asleep, i confronted one of my flatmates about it because she woke me up after i had only slept 1 1/2 hours after a 24hour period awake and couldnt fall asleep again, but she simply dismissed me saying that she felt as it was "her responsibility" and shes not going to stop waking me up
Signal	For the past week at least I've been waking up consistently at 8am and going to bed at midnight but for some reason I've just been laying there with my eyes closed for up to four hours before I can fall asleep. Despite physical and mental exhaustion, I find myself not falling asleep, and if I do, I wake up an uncountable amount of times during my sleep. If I use these 4 hours doing stuff instead of laying down, I usually can't shake the exhaustion during the day. Honestly, the exhaustion is kind of a guarantee no matter what. Hoping for a future where I can still function after 2-4 hours of sleep, the extra time could be useful. Oh well, instead I'm just exhausted all the time and not functioning at full capacity
Signal	Its been awhile but here we are. Sitting in my relciner exhausted yet wide awake. My insomnia comes in cycles maybe its bipolar who knows. But here we are. Going insane as the sun comes up. Full body restlessness. Nerves going Haywire. Everytime I almost pass out my brain goes into red alert. My hands goes numb and tingly I cant get comfy. My mattress feels like a hard slab.
Signal	I've struggled with nightly insomnia for nearly 2 years. To manage my responsibilities, I have to work constantly, as I am now very forgetful, often confused, and require many repetitions to consolidate information. I simply am much slower, and more apathetic to boot! Does anyone have advice for being more productive? I'm accomplishing the same amount of work as I used to with much more effort and a substantially greater time commitment, and this is causing many difficulties in my life, worsened self-esteem being one.
Signal	I took Eszopiclone for about two weeks, I stopped a few days ago, I have been having headache, fatigue, severe brain fog, and anxiety. I thought it would go away within 24 hours but I don’t know what to do about it. I become forgetful as well. How do I deal with it? I want it to go away
Signal	This place helped me when I was freaking out sleep deprived out of my mind. So when I'm having a bad night I come read here and maybe try to help others but it ends up triggering my fears related to insomnia and health anxiety, which fuels my insomnia.
NotSignal	Trying to sleep and being unable to creates anxiety.Just tell yourself you're just lying down to rest.Less pressure and you are resting
Signal	So here's a basic timeline of last night.2am: 2 zzzquil melatonin gummiesGummies didn't work6am: 1 dose of zzzquil oral diphenhydramine That didn't work either8am: 2 more melatonin gummiesFinally able to sleep, but the worst quality sleep ever, the type where you're sleeping, but know you're awake.Guy am I doing something wrong? I can't get sleep and I now just feel really hungover.
NotSignal	I’ve heard that many times when I’d tell people I usually get 4 to 5h of sleep everyday. People think I’m ok with that. Yeah, I wish.
NotSignal	So earlier today I had an unintended nap while I was chilling and listening to some music after work, and I fell asleep for like 2 hours. Not bad I thought and went on my day. Now it's almost midnight and I've been tossing and turning and tossing and turning and tossing and turning and tossing and turning for who knows how long. I gotta wake up for work tomorrow aswell and Im a telemarketer. Selling products while tired will not be easy. But hey atleast I had a nice nap.
NotSignal	Many people have suggested me to count from 0 to 500 and half way through I would fall asleep. Did it work for anyone?
Signal	So i've tried lavender, only helped a little, now i got valerian root capsules and melatonin capsules(1mg) , also i have anti depressants but i don't see them as an option because they are chemicals.. My inosmnia is 4 months old now(my baby\*\_\* , which i sadly hate more than anything)
NotSignal	Alright so around the start of April like around the 5th, i had my first night of total sleeplessness. It was nothing like i’ve ever felt before i just felt active the entire night, and most of the next day too then the next few nights i slept pretty well and then back to total sleepless. Anyway fast forward till now and i end up pulling all nighters every 2-3 nights. How exactly bad is this? I’m a teen and as someone who worries about their health i’m a bit worried about this, how bad is it? Have I shortened my life span? And does anybody else feel like this.
Signal	Hey guys, newbie here. This is a long one so I apologise if you don’t feel like reading it. Ever since I was a child, I’ve had really bad insomnia - I’m talking since I was about 5 years old. And it’s not the “staying up an hour or two past bedtime” I’m talking about staying up all night and not going to bed until 3,4,5am (yes, even as a kid). Sometimes I wouldn’t sleep at all. My body gets to a certain point and decides it’s just going to be up. I’ve gone up to three nights before, but that’s rare. It has gotten worse as I got older because of health issues that causes pain - but again, my insomnia started as a child. However, it’s not every night that I had trouble sleeping. Like the other night I passed out at 9p and woke up fully around 7a I think. I’ve done multiple sleep studies - though I admit my last one was three years ago. I have seen sleep specialists, neurologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. I have tried every trick I read online to try and help (ie changing diet, no tech after this time, get up and do something if you can’t fall asleep after this time, etc). Minus recently, once I am asleep I sleep quite well; it’s just the falling asleep thing I have a problem with. Caffeine also doesn’t affect me like it does normal people so I still drink it - though I did once go a year without a single drop. I do have ADHD, however, I have yet to find a medication (or a combo) that allows me to treat the symptoms but allows me to fall asleep. I also have depression but that has stemmed from a recent injury. Melatonin makes me sick and never really worked. I avoided any prescriptions, but broke down after my current pain management specialists found out about my recent 3 night no-sleep-thing (okay I told but yeah). I’m currently on ambien. Doesn’t work. Also I’m not a super human that can function on little sleep despite what my brother thinks. I feel like absolute shit by 3am and the feeling worsens the longer I don’t sleep.
Signal	Looking for recommendations, perhaps one of you has experienced the same thing and can provide some guidance. I seem to struggle with maintaining my sleep. I average 2-5 hours a night, but it’s consistently broken up with 2-2.5 hours at the start, and if I’m lucky, I’ll get another 2-3 or so on the tail end. My biggest struggle is actually staying asleep - I seem to get one cycle and then it becomes a struggle. I will typically fall asleep around 11pm-12am and wake up on or around the 2am mark somewhere. I’ve been prescribed zopiclone, so after the first wake up period is when I’ll take 1/3 or so of a pill just to be able to fall back asleep, otherwise I’ll just lay there until it’s time to get up for work. I really don’t like taking these things though, so I keep what I do take FAR below my recommended dosage (7.5mg). I’ve tried weighted blankets, melatonin, valerian root, all the sleep hygiene stuff, temperature regulation with AC, a bunch of different pillows, I sleep with those Bose sleepbuds in my ears, and more. I’ve tried weed and pure CBD, and a combination of both. I limit my coffee intake to one coffee and it’s done by 830 or so in the morning. I don’t eat heavy meals or workout late at night and I’m pretty consistent with my routine in general. I don’t work shift work and have had the same work schedule for over ten years. I’ve had a sleep apnea test and I’ve had bloodwork done. All is normal, but the sleep apnea test pointed toward poor sleep quality - I seem to barely dip into REM for long. My doctor is a bit of an idiot, he has suggested that further testing is “me”. That I should try yoga and all that. I feel like there must be an underlying condition in me somewhere, but he seems uninterested. Covid forced the cancellation of an introductory appointment with a new doctor, so I’m just kind of... stuck. I list this all to ask - have any of you experienced similar struggles, tried everything I’ve listed above, and found a solution? Thanks!
NotSignal	This comes and goes, but currently I have this problem where i dont get tired until much later than I should. So i try to sleep a little earlier, maybe 30 minutes to an hour early than the night before, I am not tired but I try my best to fall asleep.Then as I am falling asleep, i am not tired enough or something so ill feel myself slowly falling asleep apposed to not realizing it and just remember waking up. I'll sometimes be in this weird dreaming but awake state, not quite sleep paralysis or anything like that. I am not sure why but whenever i feel this my brain flips a switch and tells me I shouldn't be asleep. This can happen for every thirty seconds or longer so ill be on the verge of sleep just waiting for it to happen for hours.
NotSignal	Can’t fall asleep till 8am now✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼Love my life✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼Kill me please🥺🥺🥺✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
Signal	I go to bed at around 12 am - 1 am and get up between 7:30 am and 8:30 am everyday which is usually 7 hours of sleep. Usually I am in a deep sleep in the morning. My mind suddenly wakes me up sometime between 7:30am -8:30 am. It doesn’t feel like I am waking up naturally. It feels like someone is forcefully waking me from sleep. My head pains all day. I feel like sleeping in the afternoon. I try to get up at 9:30 am or 10:30 am to feel more fresh but once it is 8:30 am I wake up and unable to force myself to sleep afterwards. This has been happening from past few days. Not sure how to cure this type of insomnia.
NotSignal	Went to bed an hour ago. Been tossing and turning. Shit just running around in my mind. I need to sleep so bad but can’t. This sucks.
NotSignal	Do any kind of research and it all concludes the same thing - you're lying in bed worrying about something, the quarantine we're all under right now is causing more stress than ever which is causing us to sleep less and struggle with it.Uhh...nope.Nothing on my mind. No worries. No money issues.I mean I'm lonely and bored right now like I imagine a lot of people are, and stuck indoors allllllll day rarely getting out, but not worried about anything. I don't lie in bed thinking "Oh god what if I get sick" or "Oh god I don't know if I'll get paid" etc.I've had insomnia in the past where I didn't sleep for days. Lasted 6 months. Due to a work overload. That was some 6 years ago and I've slept like a baby since, with the odd bad night here and there like everyone gets.What I hate is how my mind just breaks from the norm one day. Like now. It's been almost 2 weeks now of tossing and turning until circa 2am and then asleep until about 7. Body loves to wake up at the same time at least...Survivable. Liveable. Doable. Not the end of the World. Just god damn annoying. I can live on 4 or 5 hours. I WANT my 7 back though as I hate the dull headaches on less sleep.What I don't understand is why things have changed from asleep in minutes to asleep in hours.Before, I'd lie in bed at 10:30 watching some YouTube and feel drowsy. Roll on my side, prop my tablet up and put something else on as it gets closer to 11. Close my eyes. Feel myself getting drowsier after about 10 minutes. Turn off the tablet, roll on my left side, eyes closed. Thoughts start to turn to visuals. Great, I'm about to....*click* gone. Asleep. It's awesome. Been doing it for many, many years like clockwork.Now though for almost 2 weeks, the visuals appear and then nothing. No sleep. And it's not like my mind is racing. It's not. I'm just lying there and not asleep.I'm now waiting to sleep. Like waiting for a train. Not worried about it, just bloody waiting. Why aren't I asleep? I'm pretty tired.And once I pass that usual sleepy phase, suddenly my body just wakes up. I go for a pee or something and realize I don't feel sleepy any more but get back in to bed anyway.Look at the clock maybe once, realize its' 12:30 or something and just think "why am I still awake?"I know this is a passing phase, this too shall pass, but it's damn annoying that people assume I'm worried about something.I'm not. I'm just waiting to sleep gone 1am.
Signal	It happened about 3 weeks ago. I was shocked when I heard the news but it didn't effect me so much and I went about my day regularly. But at night it was the only thing in my mind and I couldn't sleep at all. The thing is I don't understand why because me and this guy were not close AT ALL! I can count on one hand the number of times we interacted and it was always very impersonal and polite. I didn't like him (I didn't NOT like him either) , I wasn't attracted to him, he wasn't my friend, I was basically indifferent. So why am I constantly thinking about this guy at night so much that I can't sleep! Sometimes I see his face in my mind's eye and it's disturbing! I can go about my day normally but at night I find myself fretting and anxious and unable to fall asleep. I was just taking short naps during the day the first days and now I fall asleep around 6 am and wake up at noon. I'm always tired now and I've never had insomnia before. I hope it's okay to write this here and please let me know if it's not.
NotSignal	I went to bed around 11 pm or 12 am and woke up at 4am. Should I hold out til tonight or sleep right now? The previous night I slept from 12am to 7am.
Signal	I was in this sub Reddit posting frequently in December when I got this horrible wave of insomnia and sleepless nights. However that went away and I’ve been sleeping fine.... until now. It’s spring break and I stood up an hour later than I usually do (1 am) and my brain decided it didn’t want me to sleep at all and now it’s nearly 4 am. Why does this happen to me? I was tired and not it feels like I’m not. What’s happening to me? I’m going to go into another fatal insomnia panic which would make it even harder to sleep.
NotSignal	I just need to vent. It’s almost 5 in the morning and I can’t fucking sleep, like usual. Ok so long story short: I just finished college (yay?) but when the pandemic hit in mid March, my uni kicked us all off campus and I had to move back in with my parents. I know how ungrateful I sound, but we have so many issues and it’s a very tense household. Anyway I graduated, I have no job and I keep getting rejection after rejection. I can’t get a job so I can’t move out. Im a hard worker and I just need someone to give me a fucking chance. I’m so fucking sad and angry all the time now it’s making it impossible for me to sleep. I’m so lonely, I have no friends here, I have no future and nothing to look forward to and my brain won’t even give me the release of sleep.
NotSignal	I have been suffering from allergies for a few years now. This spring has been the worst for it. I take flonase and claratin for them and noticed if I take the flonase at night, I was up with anxieties about waking up because I swallow and/or lightly snore. I wear a nasal strip and have tried several different breathing nose devices with no real winners.I switched to taking the flonase and claratin in the early morning before work and taking benadryl to help me fall asleep at night. My mom told me the steroid in flonase was causing the anxiety and to take it first thing in the morning. And for 3 or so months now, I haven't had that anxiety. I would wake up sometimes if I'd snore but I would drink water and fall back asleep. I also have been using a mypuremist steam device to clean out my sinuses every day.Tonight my sinuses are draining and right before falling asleep I snored a little and woke myself up. I then tries several positions with my head propped up and on my side and switching sides. No luck. I kept waking up every time I would swallow hard. Doing what my mother told me And staying up since my body is not ready for sleep apparently.My sleep schedule is usually very regulated, has been since 2013 where I get up early (5:30am) and go to bed around 8pm. I don't have health insurance to go to a sleep clinic plus I don't want to with the pandemic and all. I have been toying around with the idea that I have a form of sleep apnea. I think it has to do specifically with my draining sinuses and the back of my throat.Is it a chronic sinus infection? Could be from taking the flonase for a while? I have read that too. I was diagnosed with a viral obe back in March but I have heard that if they are Bacterial that they can stick around for a long time untreated.I know it's a lot to go through. Any advice/remedies would be greatly appreciated.
NotSignal	I sleep around 4 and wake up around 11 everyday. I hate it so much, but I don’t feel sleepy. Even if I do, it’s so hard to fall asleep. It needs to stop but I cannot do anything. Should I give sleep pills a try?
NotSignal	So, the last 2 weeks when my girlfriend has stayed over at my house, I haven't needed my medication when we go to bed. Has anyone else found or noticed something similar? Like, sleeping WITH someone (not just sex lol) has immensely helped like calm you and help you sleep?
NotSignal	So it all started back in a year when I was going to Berlin with my friend and we had a night flight. We practically did not sleep that night and I ended up having anxious thoughts the next day when falling asleep. I believe these anxious thoughts prevented me from falling asleep, even though I was tired. I ended up falling asleep that night but the fact that this thought can appear when I don't get a good sleep previous night still haunt me. It has been three days since they have returned, I go to bed at 1 am, and lay in my bed practically forcing myself to sleep, but the thoughts in my head just appear to be all over the place, thought about what would happen if I couldn't sleep this night. Basically I can not fall asleep, because thoughts in my head make me afraid that I may not be able to sleep and keeps me stressed out until I magically fall asleep in 3-4 hours. This weird anxiety about not being able to sleep is the thing keeping me awake, any ideas or tips you can give me?
Signal	I have chronic insomnia but it’s worse when I do drugs like Tn, so if you’re up call me/ text me 5059911791
Signal	Hey there. Sorry if this is a mess, I'm tired haha. I'll fix it when I've woken up more.I guess I've always had insomnia, I didn't know that insomnia was also just not sleeping good, and I've experienced that for years. But recently, since last week (half way into the first week of remote learning for school), it's gotten 10x worse. I normally go to bed at like 12 or 1 and wake up between 10 and 12. Well, now it's been going to bed at 4pm and waking up at 2pm and only getting worse from there. I thought I had just messed up my sleep schedule by staying up too late and then letting myself sleep in too much, but when I tried to fix it, I couldn't. I keep ending up staying up much later and it feels impossible for me to actually get to sleep. I just toss and turn all night. For at least a week, I was at least accompanied by dreams (so I was in a deep sleep I think) but for 2 days now, dreams are also gone. Along with that, on wednesday night, I think it took me until 5 to actually get to sleep and I ended up waking up at 12. That night, last night, it took me until, what I would assume, almost 7am to fall asleep and even with that sleep, it was hella light. I made myself wake up at 12, but was too tired so I went back to sleep until 1, but could hardly actually sleep; just tosses and turns. Another interesting addition to all this is either for like a few weeks or 2 months (time doesn't exist in my head apparently), I'd assume more like a few weeks, I always get super paranoid late at night like there's something behind me or beside me. That feeling caused me to not be able to sleep from 4-5 last night until I got paranoid enough to have to chill on my phone for a bit until I felt more tired. I never felt more tired but it was almost 6, so I figured I should prob try to sleep. Why is this happening all of the sudden??
NotSignal	So at about 12am I hear these female moans coming from my neighbor below me , I was watching tv so it wasn't to obnoxious but then I turn off my tv at 1am to try to sleep and I hear female moans again lol, funny thing is I believe this dood swings both ways as on another occasion I could literally hear him having sex with a guy lol as he was obviously the receiver and being quite vocal lol. I believe this time it was definitely a hooker as when they finished not a peep was heard down there he lives alone as I do , well it's now 4am and that's my story of my freak neighbor.
NotSignal	Usually I’m asleep by 30 minutes ish after being in bed if I haven’t had a nap that day and today I didn’t take a nap and I didn’t sleep in late so idk what to do to get me to fall asleep? Should I take some Benadryl or something idk what to do help!
Signal	I just moved house not long ago to a significantly better environment. I was sleeping at reasonable hours, getting up early, and was actually on an upswing for once, but then issues at work piled up and now I’m stressed, putting off going to sleep until late again (still getting up early though), and back to being depressed and apathetic.My major trouble was all the overtime I was pulling over the holidays, we needed the money to move, so when a coworker asked me to cover a shift I thought why not?I’d already done 38hrs so when the paycheque didn’t look to account for the extra shift I panicked thinking I’d wasted the time entirely. Sent a message to my boss hoping it would get sorted but apparently all I managed to do was piss him off because he thinks I was accusing him of something.Now that I’m back on regular hours, he’s cut my pay down from the 26 I’m contracted for to 22. I was already living paycheque to paycheque and worse still I can’t even argue because the way he scheduled me doesn’t let me do the full hours even if I try.Now I need to work up my extremely shoddy communication skills to try and sort this out without pissing him off further and putting myself out of the job.I keep putting off trying to sleep because every time I do I start rehearsing what I’m going to say if I ever get him to stay still, following the chain of personal errors that led to this point, and any number of unhelpful things.I just want things to be settled already.
Signal	(17f) i've had sleeping problems since early adolescence, and this quarantine actually gave me a chance to stop fighting my own mind. If i'm not tired, fine i won't sleep; whereas usually i'd rummage through my little collection of sedative prescriptions, pick one at random, and maybe pray a little bit. I didn't have anything to lose so one night i just waited until i was tired. Well, one night turned into another day, and by 3am the next night i must've finally produced some 100% home grown melatonin from my brain because i was tired! Better yet, what followed was 6 uninterrupted hours of deep sleep! Unconventional but amazing. Rinsed and repeated for the next few days and i'm pleased with how it's going so far. Yet I can't help but wonder, something that comes so naturally to me couldn't possibly be unhealthy... right?
NotSignal	So for some time, I've been thinking that it's not not that crazy to think I might have insomnia, because it's hard for me to fall asleep. I don't have trouble staying asleep. But after wearing my smartwatch while in bed to measure my sleep, I'm not so sure anymore. From what I know, I think it takes me from 20-30 minutes up to around 1-2 hours to fall asleep. Sadly I couldn't post a photo of it, so here's the data of my sleep last night in text:Efficiency: 94%Actual sleep time: 6 hrs 21 minsAwake: 23 minsREM: 2 hrs 22 minsLight: 3 hrs 25 minsDeep: 36 minsI'm not sure what to make of this.
NotSignal	If only every night could be like that, I can't even describe just how sharp my mind felt ,and my anxiety level was so low,for once life didn't feel overwhelming
Signal	Hi everyone, I’ve been having chronic onset insomnia for 6 months now and I’ve been using weed to help me get some rest or some sleep at night. I’ve been having brain fog everyday for 6 months now and it feels terrible. I don’t want to take sleeping pills but at this point I feel as if I have to. Is anyone else going through this or has gone through it ? Any suggestions?
Signal	Ive always struggled with insomnia, but off and on. The last six months it’s been the worst it’s ever been though. On a good night I have about six hours of sleep with a lot of interruptions (waking up randomly). But on a bad night I get 3-4 of sleep with interruptions. A good night of 7-8 hours of sleep with no or only one interruption for a bathroom brake, is a utopia for me. The last that happened was like a year ago.Although I’ve had anxiety years ago, I’ve been doing well in recent years. However, now that I’ve been essentially sleep deprived I’m getting more and more anxious and always at night. I’m a bit more on edge and easily nervous during the day as well. Could my insomnia be causing anxiety? Is this a common thing?
Signal	Every time I feel like I’m about to pass out I remember that I’m falling asleep and quickly wake back up and my heart starts beating very fast. I’m terrified I’ll never sleep again. I sleep fine some nights but others I convince myself something will go wrong and I always start to feel tired but it’s the same thing of, I’m about to fall asleep and I wake myself back up. I’m so tired. I feel like I can sleep potentially but I’m afraid I won’t be able to if I try. So I just stay on my phone in hopes that I may just pass out.
Signal	Tonight I'll be taking melatonin, doxylamine, and magnesium.i've also eaten a banana and drank hot water with honey and himalayan salt.and it's never 100% sure because sometimes it just doesn't happen for me 🤷🏻‍♀️see you in dreamland.. Hopefully
NotSignal	Not even gonna bother going back to bed. All it does is stress me the fuck out. I know it's really not good to skip out on sleep but honestly fuck thisss I'd rather stay up for a little while longer than lay in bed for hours tossing an turning.
Signal	I just started taking trazodone for my insomnia and im having some mild side effects, wondering if I should call my doctor or if these are normal.When im lying in bed and the medicine is kicking in, I have slight passing pains around my sinus areas, and also mildly in my penis... it also seems to give me a mild erection. Also, I cant tell if its because I get nervous from the side effects or if its the medicine itself, but i also feel like my heart rate increases.In the morning, I notice that my mouth is dry and I get a stuffy nose but thats not too bad, just a tad annoying.Does anyone else have these? is this normal?
NotSignal	I fell asleep without a problem at around 10:30 pm and woke up to pee at 1:00 AM unable to go back to sleep. I tossed and turned until i gave up at 4:00 am. Fell back into a really light sleep at around 6:30 am and had to be up for 7:30 am. I hope it was only one bad night. 🤞🏼
Signal	Hi guys.. Super new here, super stressed about my situation.I've had problems sleeping my whole life. It started to get unbearable when I was a freshman in college. After being diagnosed with insomnia, my neurologist (also chronic migraine sufferer, lack of sleep makes them worse) prescribed Ambien CR, 12.5mg when I was 19. I'm now 32, have been on Ambien consistently since then, it's no longer very effective, so I supplement (my doctors are all aware of this) with Unisom (50mg gel caps x 4 capsules per night) and Melatonin (12mg x 2 tablets per night). This combination is no longer effective, and I'm sick of being on all this damn medication, so I finally managed to get a referral to a sleep clinic in the neurology department at the hospital where my doctors are located. I am seeing a sleep specialist and was referred to a psychiatrist within the clinic for CBT for insomnia. I'm 3 appointments into the CBT-I, it's helping some, but not enough. I did a home sleep study after my first appointment with the sleep specialist, and we've gotten the results. When the sleep specialist examined me, I was told that I have extremely narrow nasal passages and a severely deviated septum. I also have a very narrow jaw, when I was getting braces I had to have an appliance in my lower jaw to widen it. I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea (obstructive, not related to weight), and they are recommending CPAP as treatment. I absolutely do not want to try CPAP if there are other options, like surgical intervention or orthodontic intervention, that could help. The way I see it, why would I want something that I would be dependent on for the rest of my life (CPAP machine) if there is a possibility that I could resolve the issue entirely within a few months, maybe a year if orthodontic measures are needed? I feel like CPAP should be the last resort, when other interventions do not work? CPAP machines are expensive and delicate and definitely cumbersome. I want to talk to my doctor about surgical and orthodontic options, but am worried I will be steam rolled into CPAP and stuck with it for the rest of my life. Has anyone else had to deal with this kind of a situation? What worked for you? Did you speak to your doctor about other options for treatment? My appointment is in a week and a half and I am making notes to take with me. Any tips would be so greatly appreciated!
NotSignal	Through out this whole pandemic I’ve drank a few here and there to sleep. No problem. I’ve been drink free for 3 days and I’m having so much trouble sleeping NyQuil won’t help anymore. I’m scared to drink too much of the stuff to the point I end up in the hospital.
Signal	No sleep aid will work for more than a week. My first bottle of ambien didn’t work for more than a few days.
Signal	Pyrazolam; threshold 0.5mg Common 2-3mg Strong 3-4mgHeavy 4mg+ with an ampule of 1ml and 1.0mg in acetonitrile. Recommendation; skepticism
Signal	I have sleep maintenance issues i fall asleep after struggling and wake up after 2 hours like it’s so fucking frustrating why can’t i have 7 hours of sleep after that much shit i go through. I wake up 3 times a night if i manage to fall asleep that is after waking up my anxiety is through the roof and can’t do anything to calm me down. Please anyone help me sleep for longer than 2 hours any suggestions?
Signal	I've always been this way, but it just got more intense and annoying, at nights I'm energetic, happy and productive I'm like a different person, only if I've slept good the night before or drunk coffee thoughIn daytimes, no matter what I'm doing, although more intense if it's something hard like school, I'm this depressed and down person, I always want to sleep and could sleep as long as I want to, without caffeine I just can't go through school even though I find the subjects interesting, not only do I suddenly hate to be at the school, I just can't resist falling asleep, there's times I just don't remember how I fell asleep in a class, before I fall asleep I'm naturally sleepy so I can barely learn or even understand what my teacher is saying, so I end up taking like 600mg caffeine total throughout the dayAlso strangely, I can wake up fairly normally at 7am, but when it's 8, I just waste 40 mins trying to wake up, it's like I'm fighting myself, and eventually be late to schoolI'm looking stimulants and waking up early and studying late when I can to help with this but none of this is really the cure so I wonder if there's anything better I could do? Thanks in advance
Signal	I kind of have school and I’m tired, 3:07am right now. I want to go to sleep, I close my eyes but I don’t. I don’t want to watch Netflix, I don’t want to scroll through social media, no music, I just want to sleep lol. I didn’t take any naps today and I had sleep medicine yesterday that helped me go to sleep before 3am.I would’ve taken some for school but they give me weird dreams, like creepy weird 💀Sometimes I take naps and can’t go to sleep until 4am, sometimes I don’t can’t cant go to sleep until 4am.I guess I just have to wait until my body decides to go to sleep 😔
NotSignal	So since this quarantie thing i started watching netflix (Money heist to be exact) and i have been staying up all night till 5 am watching and i usually fell asleep at 5:30 and slept for 8-10 hours which felt good but my days were very short. And now that i finished money heist i wanted to fix my sleeping schedule, so i decided to stay all night all day so i can go to bed at 10-11pm. So i stayed till 11pm and i took a shower and went to bed and it felt really good, i was tired and i just wanted to sleep. I was really tired but i kinda struggled to fell asleep.. it took me 1 hour and i was sleeping. I slept for 11 hours and i felt good. The next night i went to bed at 2am and i left my phone on the table because i was tired and wanted to sleep. I layed in my bed rolling and struggling to sleep untill 4:30am.. I was rly tired and sleepy but i just could not fell asleep.. I dont have anxiety but i just cant fall asleep.. IDK what it is but when my eyes are closed i just keep getting like a white light glowing.. like a flashlight glancing from time to time to my eyes, also my eyes are rolling to the sides and thats really bothering me when im trying to sleep..(This is almost happening every time not only just this night).. So i fell asleep at 4:30am and i wake up at 10am so i decide to get up earlier so i can go to bed earlier and easily tonight. So at around 10:30-11pm i feel rly tired and sleepy and i went to bed.. I was really comfy but it was not falling asleep... I layed for 1 hour and i was just starting to get mad and nervour that i could not sleep.. So my brother made some noise and that was it... That just triggered me i yelled at him and i was awaken... So then i layed for 1 more hour and finally fell asleep but struggled alot..(rolling, getting hot...) I slept for 10 hours and today i feel good.. IDK what it is but i don't like sleeping i just hate thinking about it, i hate going bed tired and sleepy with a feeling that im going to sleep alot, good and easy and i just cant... it sucks.. Also when my eyes are closed the weird glowing white light and my eyes rolling to the side distracting me from sleeping.. idk i just cant i hate it....Edit: (I forgot to mention that this happens every few months.. there are times that I fell asleep in 10-15minutes with no problems but its more rarely)&#x200B;I will do an update tomorrow about tonight..
NotSignal	For the first time in a while I really cant go to sleep, I work in tree hours, I wanted to know if it was worth it to go to sleep for those last 3 hours if I can, and if I don't will I be fine at work ? Im a butcher, its somewhat physical and I have to interact with clients, Im stressing tf out what should I do ?
Signal	You always hear to "treat the underlying cause"...my insomnia got kickstarted by severe anxiety and panic.Anyone have any thoughts or experiences on treating anxiety to relieve insomnia?
NotSignal	Does anyone know of comfortable and effective ear plugs that wouldn’t bother you if you were to sleep with your ears pressed against the pillow.
NotSignal	Waited almost 2 hours in bed with my eyes closed. I really just gave up and im currently turning my ps4 (I barely use it)
Signal	Hi everyone! I am 17F and I can't sleep as of recent. I stay up all night and sleep from like 11am-2pm these past few days if that and I am fully energized and it feels like I slept all night. Like right now its 5am and I just wanna work out or clean my room cause I can't sleep. I have tried just laying there and that does not work. So the other night I took a bunch of Benadryls to sleep, but I know I can't do that consistently because then it will become problematic. I was on vacation 2 weeks and I slept fine (was asleep by 4am after hours of laying down) (no time zone change) and now I can't sleep and I just get on with my day. Does anyone have tips or tricks to sleep? Or does anyone know if there is something wrong with me??&#x200B;Thank you. TLDR- Cant sleep for more than 3 hours after staying awake all night.
Signal	I have been using cannabis oil (cbd/thc) which has no effect on helping me fall sleep. It makes me drowsy which is even more painful to deal with when I can't sleep. I'm looking for a medication that won't cause me any memory issues. I have heard Halcion works great, can anyone clarify ?

Signal	So, Ive had issues in the past with occasionally waking up too early, say around 4 or 5 am and not being able to get back to sleep, but this has been very infrequent. However, the past 4 nights I've only managed about 4 to 5 hours of sleep because I'll wake up at 4 AM and won't be able to get back to sleep.I did have a recent health scare that might have helped in triggering this. Essentially I had epididymits, which causes testicular pain that lasts several weeks, often even after antibiotics are finished. I'm a hypochondriac, so of course I had trouble with fears that it was cancer. That has cleared up, but now insomnia is adding to my anxiety.Any advice for dealing with this? I don't have issues getting to sleep, just staying asleep and returning to sleep after waking up. I tried some melatonin and it didn't seem to help. I'm looking at getting a weighted blanket tonight.
NotSignal	I'm an extremely obese (500 lbs) 34 year old male. I am terrified of going to sleep. The idea of being asleep and being blindsided by death is so scary. To the point that I will cry myself to sleep knowing that I might not wake up. As I'm falling asleep I will scream and when I wake up, I wake up screaming. This isn't fear of nightmares. When I dream, they're pleasant and I wake up refreshed. I tend to sleep in 1-2 hour bursts with 2-3 hours awake in between. Oh and I have a well maintained cpap that I use consistently.My father was as big as me and died in his sleep when he was 35, though he apparently battled alcoholism and I only have a drink or 2 per week. I guess this year would be worse if he died at 35. Does anybody experience this? What can I do to fix it? Help.
NotSignal	I didn't sleep at all last night and it's now 5 am and I've not slept again. My brain feels slow: I think those who have been through this will understand but it's like everything is in slow motion. Any tips?
NotSignal	Hey friends, first time posting on here and i was just wondering how many people experience anxiety poops when they are trying to sleep?! I dont have insomnia officially but i guess experience a bit of it when i cant sleep occasionally (usually twice a week i toss and turn until the early hours or wake up ridiculously early cant get back to sleep etc etc).. anyway, what struck me as a bit weird is how it can affect so many other bodily functions.. i had a spout of anxiety last night and it and the subsequent poops every 10 minutes when i tried to sleep kept me up until 4am... How many others out there have this problem and what do you do about it?
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for as long as I can remember. My entire life I’ve had issues sleeping. When I was a kid my parents bought me every single Geronimo Stilton book because I could never fall asleep so I would stay up reading instead. The older I got the more I realized what I was actually dealing with and how awful it made me feel both physically and mentally. My dad has insomnia, so that’s how my parents knew I had it too. My granny on my dad’s side also has insomnia and she gets between 2-4 hours of sleep a night. I have, since then, been diagnosed with chronic insomnia by my doctor. I think what makes me feel the most defeated is that my dad(48) and my granny(70) still have sleeping issues and nothing has worked for them. I, personally, have tried all the sleep tips imaginable. From not using electronics nearing bed time, reading before bed, not showering too close to bed time, not sitting or hanging out on my bed unless my intent is to go to sleep, getting up and doing something if I find myself awake in bed, no caffeine, seldom do I drink alcohol, I’ve tried smoking weed (it’s legal where I am and I’m 20 years old), melatonin, taking magnesium, yoga, meditation, sleepy time tea, trazodone,zopiclone, and a number of other otc sleeping pills. I find myself getting really upset over the fact I don’t think I’ll ever be able to sleep well at all. My insomnia has affected every aspect of my life. My job, my university education, my mental and physical health, everything I do my insomnia some how finds a way to make things more difficult for me. If you have had insomnia your whole life and are now in your 30’s+, can you please tell me if it’s gotten any better for you? Is there anything you’ve tried that I haven’t listed here that maybe you could recommend? I’m going into my final year of my undergrad and my grades count more now than ever before since I’m planning on starting masters applications soon. I read academic articles on insomnia often and I read one about a study done in Amsterdam that narrowed down 7 genes linked to insomnia. I’ve always wondered if my insomnia is a result of crappy genetics or if there’s really something I can do to fix it. I can only assume if you’ve read this far and you’re on this sub, you also have insomnia. I hope you get a good nights sleep soon, or maybe even just a couple hours of uninterrupted sleep. You deserve it. We both do.
Signal	I‘ve slept for like 2 hours over the past 2 days. (I think the time that I thought I was sleeping I kind of just zoned out and lost track of time, so maybe no sleep at all????) Whenever I can’t sleep like this I just feel sick and gross and I can’t relax. I’m so tired I’m getting really emotional and my muscles are aching, I’m really nauseated and I’m sweating. I’ve been trying all day today to get some sleep. I took 2 doses of melatonin, a hot bath, I’ve done stretches and put on documentaries and podcasts and nothing’s working. I don’t know what else to do because I don’t have any antihistamines or anything, the only thing I have is a little alcohol but I don’t actually sleep WELL when I drink and the thought of drinking alcohol is just making me even more queasy right now. I’m really stressed because I missed a virtual meeting and a work deadline this morning because I literally can’t function, even though I tried and I just couldn’t think straight to work, and I don’t want to tell my supervisor that’s the reason why because I don’t think they’ll take me seriously. Can someone please help me?? I don’t have access to a doctor to get a prescription right now and I feel like Imm just working myself up into so much anxiety that I won’t be able to sleep until I literally collapse.
NotSignal	For the past week I (20F) have had really bad Gas problems and have woken up at night with either really bad gas to the point it feels hard to breathe or with the shakes. Typically both are accompanied with a pounding heart and sense of impending doom.I have a CPAP to help with the breathing but I'm getting fed up of my lack of sleep and just want to have a good nights sleep for once. My fiance thinks it could be Panic Attacks and Stress but I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm going to a walk in clinic to talk to someone today about maybe getting in for an EEG or a Sleep Study. It's gotten so bad that by this point I'm afraid to even try going to sleep.
Signal	I've been taking 7.5 mg at night for sleep, and ever since I started, I've had excess phlegm in my throat. Is this a common side effect? I know there could be other reasons for this, but the timing suggests, it's most likely the Mirtazapine.
Signal	Six 200mg Ibuprofen PM pills & 24 mg of Melatonin. I’ve had insomnia for as long as I can remember, kind of just dealt with it myself. Recently had a tragedy and need to sleep. This is the only combination that will actually get me to sleep. Some nights I can get by on 4 ibuprofen PMs but that is starting to get more rare. I’m in the process of getting in with a doctor to get adequate medicine but in the meantime is this too much? I understand it’s a lot but is it a lot in the sense that it’s doing harm? I know you’re not doctors but it’s 1:40am and I don’t have anyone else to ask at the moment. Thanks in advance!
Signal	I am not saying I am going to take my life BUT I haven’t felt what its like to sleep in forever. I wake up 1-2 times every hour. Last night my bf got home from work at 130 right when I fell asleep so I was woken up and never really slept. I ‘woke up’ at 10 but I didn’t get any sleep for more than 30 minutes before I would wake up again. 30 minutes go by, I’m up, fall asleep just to wake up in the next 30 minutes. I’m just ready to start mixing sleeping pills..as in today I’m trying it. Only warnings google ever gave me for mixing with alcohol so the search wasn’t helpful nor that concerned imo.I do not have the time or money to make a doctors appointment. I’m just ready to sleep forever.
NotSignal	Bored outta my mind got work in a hour woke up and ya to early and can’t go back to sleep, anyone wanna talk?
NotSignal	So I’ve gone this whole month without any quality sleep or so it seems to me. I’m generally not anxious at all throughout the day or I’m usually occupied and don’t really think about anything that could be disturbing my sleep. I’ll admit it’s quite annoying but I’ve managed to push those thoughts aside. I’ve had issues with balance and I have a rolling chair for my desk set up and It’s just become so difficult trying to sit on it because it just messes with my balance. It’s an odd feeling I can’t describe. But along with that I’ve found that it’s just becoming harder and harder to recall things, things that I’ve never had trouble with. Even things I’d done that same day. I don’t want to overplay the fact that I have trouble recalling things or that I have trouble finding my balance but it has become a concern. Could this be a symptom of not having gotten sufficient sleep for the past month?
Signal	Hi all, I tend to wake up every few hours during the night and I always check my phone to see what time it is and how much sleep I got. Then in the morning I try remembering how many times I woke up and add up the hours I slept. Is this just adding to the sleep anxiety by obsessing over how many hours I slept? Should I refrain from looking at the clock each time I wake up? What are your thoughts? Also, has anyone had success with the “less time in bed” method? I tend to lay in bed for almost 10-11 hours (I know I know way too much)! But usually I’ll settle in bed around 11pm and watch a movie until I get more sleepy then try to go to sleep. Then I don’t get out of bed till like 9 or 10am some mornings. I know I should get up out of bed when I’m laying there just trying to fall back asleep but I’m always just so dang tired that I don’t want to get up!
NotSignal	For those who don’t know, Nuralink is a device that Elon Musk is developing which will be placed inside of the skull, connecting to your brain. Elon Musk claims it will be able to cure many neurological problems such as Insomnia, hearing loss, blindness, memory loss, anxiety, depression, etc. Just yesterday they did a demo on pigs (I have not yet watched it, but judging by a bunch of tweets) and it seems to be a success.I have saw many posts on this page of people saying they give up and want to kill themselves because they’ve tried literally everything, yet nothing is able to cure their Insomnia. If you feel this way, please don’t give up hope! Look into this Nuralink thing.
NotSignal	My body just can’t handle it anymore, and shit’s driving me insane I’m like a very hot laptop you never know what could happen next
NotSignal	On the first night I kind of understood because I accidentally took a nap at 8 pm and woke up at 10 I tried to sleep but I didn't sleep until 5 am I'm typing this are 12:30 am now. And I'm wide awake should I try tea or something I'm so tired but can't sleep
NotSignal	I couldn’t fall asleep the other night and realized I was burning up (despite using AC and cooling pad). So I took my blanket off and waited until my body got cold (just past the point of it being uncomfortable) and I fell asleep almost immediately after. Give it a try if you’re struggling one day. Falling a sleep has a lot to do with circadian rhythms. And we evolved sleeping outside where it’s cold. This goes well with other circadian rhythm practices (lots of daylight as early as possible, no blue light late, blackout blinds in room, etc)
Signal	I’ve been an insomniac since I was a child and been on and off so many sleep medications for so many years that nothing works for me anymore. I have a four day weekend this week and it is really screwing up the routine that I have tried so hard to establish. It is 2:45 AM and I’m not even remotely tired. There is only so much Netflix a woman can watch. There are only so many social media posts I can like (and I’m much more generous—overly so—with my likes when I’m up late and can’t sleep). It’s getting to the point tonight (today?) where it seems like I’ll be up until the morning and then have to force myself to stay awake all day until a normal hour to reset my sleep cycle. I guess I’m just posting here because I’m bored, wired, and feeling hopeless about getting sleep. I know all the natural tricks (take a bath, lavender, essential oils, teas, podcasts, no screens, and on and on) but they just have never cut it for me.I’m hopelessly devoted to you, sleep. I want you. Please come for me. But, like, not in the forever way. I would certainly like to wake up and live another day.Feel free to comment with any tips that have worked for you, whether they be to fall asleep or to stay up throughout the next day (which is likely what I will have to do). Also, just feel free to drop a line and say hey. Lord knows I’ve got nothing going on right now.Sweet dreams! (Kidding)
NotSignal	Why is it that no matter how little I sleep I can never just nap later? My problem is that it can take me so long to fall asleep, and I can't wait around an hour to try and nap. Am I just weird or do other people have this problem?
NotSignal	Everyone asks this butAnyone else up? Feeling really lonely and tired right now. Might just pull another all nighter and pass out for sure tomorrow night.
Signal	since hs i only sleep 3-4 hrs every night. no naps or caffeine throughout the day, i try to stay productive but i always got this weird feeling bc i don’t get enough hrs n it throws off my whole day. lowkey don’t wanna get dependent on meds or anything but i just want some sleep. if i go to the doctor will they just try to give me meds or what’s up ?
Signal	It looks like my state will legalize marijuana soon and I may be able to try something for my insomnia. Right now I take Trazodone and Ropinirole but they pretty much stopped working.Does anyone have any experience with weed for insomnia and if so, could you share it? I don't want to get high, I just want to get 8 hours of sleep a few times per week. I am so tired now....
NotSignal	God insomnia hurts😭😭 I think i blacked out during the night but I am definitly sure I was awake, because i’m breathing with my mouth when I sleep & I didnt notice anything like I would when I sleep. I looked at the time & was surprised its 5:30. Ugh What should I do today in hope to crash? Yesterday I exercised ( ran for almost 5km) and it didn’t help.
Signal	Guys help please. I just want to sleep. My eyelids feel heavy but I just don’t feel tired :( I know I’m going to be tired the whole day tomorrow if I don’t sleep at least 3 hours.
NotSignal	They won’t stop and they’re freaking me out. It’s like my heart stops then continues. I need sleep for them to stop but I can’t.
Signal	So as the title says, I went an entire week sleeping from about 11pm- 9am and only waking up a couple times throughout the night, and had a very productive week and felt really happy. Right now it’s 4:30am and I can’t sleep at all and I’m feeling super discouraged. I thought I had my sleep on track but it was just momentary. Does anyone else with insomnia experience this? Where they go days where they can sleep throughout the night and then “relapse”?
Signal	for months i’ve had trouble sleeping, it’s very on and off, some night i will sleep fine and some night i won’t fall asleep for multiple hours. whether that be because of overthinking, anxiety or just not being comfortable. i find it so hard to relax physically and mentally and just end up getting lost in my own head and think about things like death or space, which i admit are interesting, but scare me a lot. i’ve been really stressed out about college as i’m finding the course i’m doing quite difficult and i just don’t speak up and bottle it all up. i can’t find the courage to go see someone about this and i’m still not sure if i should. if anyone has any tips on how to just relax in general i would be very grateful, i’ve started reading and playing video games but i feel like there is more i can do for myself.
NotSignal	So I've gotten a home sleep study done twice now. Insurance wouldn't approve the lab study so home study it is. The first time the air hose fell off and they didn't get enough data. And the second time I went in, they said to put some tape on it to keep it in place. So last night I had my second one and taped everything like they said. I woke up and the air hose wasnt on my face. Again. I'm starting to get frustrated with the home sleep study and I don't want to have to do it again. Anyone else have problems with home studies or any tips to try if I have to do it again? They said they needed at least 6 hours of data so I'm hoping it'll be enough (I haven't sent it in to get analyzed yet)
Signal	is i am going through insomnia or is it something else....? i have not slept for 2 days straight and i am not feeling sleepy at all or any other symptoms like fatigue,dizzeness,tired,low energy,focus etc.....7 months ago i had suffered this same issue by not sleeping for straight 3 days without any symptoms and on 4th days i went to doctor and get mirtazapine prescription and go to sleep forcefully (still not feeling sleepy after taking mirtazapine) ....does anybody know about this...? i am getting little worried now
Signal	okay so i just started Zoloft like two months ago and i have had the worst sleep patterns ever since then. like yesterday- good 3am to 12pm sleep. Solid. but totally unlike me. i’m so used to being a morning person but ever since these pills i haven’t gotten up before 12, and haven’t been able to fall asleep before AT LEAST 2. Now it’s 6am, I am wide awake, and can only blame my antidepressants- which i oh so desperately need since i feel like i’m falling into a black hole otherwise. anyway, good day. literally- it is day now.
NotSignal	It all started two years ago. I've always been the guy who slept, 7-8 hours a night. March arrived, three nights in a row, I woke up in the middle of the night and naturally I began to get nervous as I had to go back to sleep. This period lasted until more or less September, then it disappeared. In March it came back again, and now I have been waking up at the same time for 2 weeks, 5:45 AM. I fall asleep and wake up every 2 hours and I have hard time going back to sleep because I get nervous. I am very hypochondriac and I think that to solve it I have to resort to medicine, but of course I don't want to. I have this burning eye that doesn't want to go, do you have any advice?
Signal	I took 10mg melatonin last night and was able to sleep for straight 9hrs but after waking up this morning the top of my head hurts so bad. I never had a bad migraine before. 😣
NotSignal	Hi everyone - I think I have been in denial about my insomnia for years, and especially after having kids and assuming it was normal to sleep like crap forever. I’ve started doing a CBT-I app on my phone and it says to get out of bed after 20 minutes if I can’t sleep. This freaks me out because I’m fairly sure I’ve never fallen asleep within 20 minutes in my life, and I feel like the only reason I’m not a zombie is because I’ve pieced together enough blocks of sleep between wake periods that it ends up being 6ish hours of sleep. I’m just curious if actually getting out of bed and doing things has helped others or if it becomes even more detrimental to the ability to get back to sleep. I have a very hard time turning off my mind/worry/random songs that pop into my head for no reason... and I feel like getting out of bed would just exacerbate that issue.
NotSignal	Hello, does anyone know if there is such a thing as a timer that you can set to your pulse? Preferably one that can work with a Fitness watch.My goal is to find something that will allow me to set a timer so that I'm woken up after a certain length of time from when I've fallen asleep.Thanks very much
NotSignal	The Coke. Now I lay here wide awake for 5 hours :)
NotSignal	Hello,I'm conducting some research into sleep difficulties and tinnitus related distress. I am looking for people who experience insomnia to fill in my study. If you are over 18 years old able to spend 15-20 minutes completing the questionnaires it would be greatly appreciated. This could shed light on potential treatment options that could be beneficial to individuals who experience insomnia secondary to tinnitus. It's very much an under researched area but hugely impacts peoples quality of life. The study can be found here - [https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_8j1ttQ0ETgTBTAF](https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8j1ttQ0ETgTBTAF)Unfortunately, we are not currently able to include people with diagnosed sleep disorders (besides insomnia) in the research, but as we continue to develop research into this area, considerations of issues such as these will help us to develop future studies.We can be found on Twitter with the handle TinnitusSleep. Thank you!
Signal	I'm going to drink everything, I'm tired of sleep only two hours, I have a bottle of animal sedative, goodbye people I'm going to sleep three fucking days straight
Signal	My GP prescribed me Doxepin, I just recently got off seroquel and zoloft and stuff and i'm a little spooked about starting another antidepressant does this one work for sleep pretty well?
NotSignal	Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I really need some advice.Recently, I've been finding it increasingly difficult to fall asleep. I'll end up lying in bed for ages before I sleep, usually to some ASMR. The time I finally nod off has shifted from 2am to 4am during quarantine.However, tonight I literally could not sleep (it's nearly 7am here). I tried ASMR, I tried hypnosis, I tried lying absolutely dead still for 40 minutes straight (which was torturoush I felt like I was on the brink of sleep but nothing happened. Nothing. I also was panicking a little, and it was really difficult to slow my heart rate down, but even when it *was* slow I could not sleep. I've decided I'm just gonna tough it out for another day but I feel awful and my eyes feel so weird.Maybe I'm overreacting - it's just one night that I actually couldn't sleep. I don't know, but if it *is* a problem, I want to fix it now before it develops any further. If anyone has any advice, I would be extremely grateful.
NotSignal	Hi All,I decided to write this after I've read some of your posts. I guess I just want to vent and maybe get some support. Please bear with me.I am 27, M and I've never before had problems falling asleep. In the past 3 months, I've had recurrent sleep problems as in I either cannot fall asleep at all because I am agitated and get muscle jerks that wake me up instantly or otherwise I get a couple of hours of light sleep where I am aware of everything that's happening around me and I wake up just as agitated and tired.It first started after my city was put under lockdown and I went to live for the duration at my GFs place and we've had a massive fight and ever since it's been hell. I amended my relationship with her in the meantime, and believed this will also take care of the tension and sleep problems, but it turns out this was not the case. I tried creating a daily routine, with almost regular wakeup and sleep hours. I've tried eating 3 healthy meals per day. I've tried various teas and plant based over the counter sleeping pills. I've tried exercising. I've tried various breathing exercises and relaxation techinques based on what I've read on the internet. Sometimes they worked and I managed to sleep 4 or 4 nights on a row and just when I thought I was over it... Insomnia hit again.It's been like this for the last 3 months and I am getting really desperate and feel like I am slowly loosing my mind: it's like I perceive the world around me through a very dark lens, I feel like I cannot interact with people in normal manner and I'm starting to become extremely paranoid. Last night I had a flood of suicidal thoughts, that I barely managed to contain mostly due to exhaustion. I was constantly thinking of ending my life just to make the mental suffering go away. Now I increasingly feel like an alien in this world and in my body. Have any of you went through similar stuff? Please tell me this is not the rest of my life.Sorry for the long post.
Signal	The past 5 days, if I did not have sleeping pills in 2 occassions, I may only have gotten average of 2 hours despite giving my body plenty of opportunity to sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and cannot fall asleep back. I had sufficient sleep hygiene and stimulus control (cold dark quiet room, relaxing before bedtime, no stressful activities, etc.).Is sleep restriction really the key? If yes then how do I deal with me waking up and not falling back asleep? Should I go somewhere else to relax or I just close my eyes till sunlight goes up so somehow I can rest my eyes?
NotSignal	I haven't slept for 5 or 6 days. This is the first time something like this is happening to me I don't know what to do.
NotSignal	I've been having issues with remaining asleep since the beginning of the year. I usually am able to sleep for about two hours and then I suddenly wake up. I don't have anxiety, bladder issues, or any health problems that I know of that would cause this. I did however have some stomach issues around the time that my interrupted sleep problem began for me. Has anyone had this experience before?
Signal	So for the past four months I have been struggling with sleep and I frankly wake up everyday feeling like absolute shit. I used to have the issue with regards to the time it takes me to sleep; however, now I have trouble maintaining sleep. I wake up at 4-5am everyday and I can't get back to sleep. Last month I decided to do cardio every morning which did help my energy levels although I still woke up unsatisfied from my sleep and felt like shit. I don't know whats wrong with me, I used to drink coffee extensively but for the past month I cut down considerably. I have checked twice for sleep apnea over an entire decade and I do not have it. What would you recommend?
NotSignal	me: *lays in bed for three hours straight with no electronics or lights on and still can't sleep*my parents: electronics (pretend it's the drake n josh meme but it says electronics okay thanks you can laugh now)
NotSignal	once upon a time I was traveling the greenery country....**What's next?**1) Simply write the next part of the story in a comment below2) Be sure to read the comment before yours so you know whats happening in the story3) Let's keep it going!
NotSignal	Hello everyone! I'm struggling with insomnia for a while now and I have tried several sleeping pills and NONE of them have helped. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks a lot!:)
Signal	Title please help, I can't call off but my insomnia has killed me. I have work in 1 hour. How do I survive for ~10-12 hours? Any tips are appreciated
Signal	I’ve been dealing with insomnia since I was 13 years old and 17 years later, I’ve gotten to know my insomnia pretty well. I can always tell about two days beforehand that I’m about to experience reduced sleep and then eventually total sleeplessness. I just get this sense of foreboding . It never fails, about two days after the initial onset of that feeling my sleep starts going to shit. I start dropping from about 8 hours of sleep a night to about 5 hours and then to about 2 hours and then absolutely nothing for two to four days. Generally after the fourth day I’ll crash and sleep for 16 hours straight, but my longest sleepless streaks have lasted for 6 days. I can also always tell when I’ll be able to sleep again. It’s literally like a light bulb turning on and I can just tell that when I lay my head down that night I’ll be able to sleep. This pattern repeats about every 15 to 20 days. I was just curious if anyone else experiences anything similar.
Signal	I have been taking trazodone with mixed results. On many occasions, I wake up after 6-7 hours of sleep feeling anxious and it leaves me in a fog for the rest of the day. Omega-3 has helped.I want to try CBD. Do I need to stop trazodone completely before using it, or can I give it a go on the weekend before getting back to the prescription on Monday?
Signal	Hey guys, I have never experienced insomnia before so I was initially quite worried about this condition. I am 21, and I have proper sleep hygiene (everyday sleep at 10:30, wake at 7am, no caffeine etc.)2 weeks ago, I had an early morning exam and an overnight computer download which kept me awake after 12am. That night, I couldnt sleep one minute (as I was stressing over both tasks) and thats NEVER happened before. Ever since that night, I would have a sleeping pattern consisting of one night of 5-6 hr sleep and the following night of no sleep at all. I have reason to believe that because of that first sleepness night, I had researched all over the internet about insomnia and this gave me severe sleep anxiety. Whenever i try to sleep, I start thinking about "what if I dont sleep and what if I lost my ability to sleep?" I know this sounds dumb to many of you but my mind is always racing when I close my eyes. I may have also developed hydrocondria as I initially also thought that I had sFI - thankfully, I recovered mostly from this thought. I Tried taking melatonin with little success. 2 days ago, I started taking my parents prescription Ambien and that puts me to sleep real fast.My question is, is this SUDDEN insomnia normal for someone like me? And how do I reset my sleeping habits (naturally)? I do occasionally have 5-6 nights a year where I would only sleep like 2-3 hours (doing work, hanging with friends etc.) but I always recover the next day. How is this time so much more severe?
NotSignal	I’ll be laying there and think only 10 minutes have gone but then I’ll look at the clock (which I know I shouldn’t be doing) and it’ll be an hour, then two hours, three hours and so on.
Signal	Hello, I'm looking for a sleeping pill. I dont need one that will cut me off my feet in the blink of an eye, I dont have that big problems, but melissa and melatonin alone cant get me sleep. When I don't take anything to sleep, it takes one hour, but without touching phone. I also have RLS. I am currently using mianserin 20mg, but I want to try something different. I don't want to have significantly increased appetite, or feel sleepy during the day, like on mirtazapine.
NotSignal	I’ve always had problems with sleep. But after experiencing something traumatic (at night) it got worse. I feel like I’ve tried every over the counter thing except cbd or mj. I don’t want to rely on pills or substances to keep me asleep at night but at this point I’m so exhausted. The only thing that helped was sleeping with my husband but as he’s been away in the military it’s been rough. Does anyone have any suggestions or anything that would help?
Signal	I wasn't sleeping at a normal hour (I have DSPD), waking up about every 60 minutes, and some times waking up early and not being able to fall back asleep. Getting worse with age. I tried sleep hygeine... like ALL of the sleeping medications EVEN belsomra. But nothing could keep me asleep.THIS WORKED FOR ME: I read that many people are magnesium deficient without knowing it and one side effect is sleep disturbances. So, I thought why not... I went to the grocery store and picked up a bottle of 300 mg magnesium supplements. Guys, I'm not kidding you, I went from waking up EVERY hour to being able to sleep for 4 hours in a row. I'm still a light sleeper and probably not sleeping as well as a normal person should but this made such a huge difference. I was starting to not be able to tell dreams from reality, hallucinations, and no more short term memory before this. It might not work for you, obviously, but worth a shot!
NotSignal	It never works like that, but I like to tell myself it will.
NotSignal	One of the hardest choices to make is the “well im not sleeping tonight, might as well get up and do something I’ll enjoy.”Anything is better than tossing and turning for hours but I rarely get out of bed and enjoy the time instead. What about y’all?
NotSignal	Happens each time I close my eyes to sleep for a few secs. My brain just won't shut itself down. There's moment in the day I feel very sleepy, go to bed straight after that. And NOPE lol I can't get even a minute of sleeping. Can't sleep in the night, can't sleep in the day, no napping, just nothing.
NotSignal	It can take anywhere from 1:30(rarely) to 2:30/3 am(usually) to fall asleep and even then Ill wake up 2-3 times afterwards. I have a shitloaf og experience with melatonin, but it fucks with my dreams really badly and honestly barely helps, even in very high doses. I don't truly get any sleep unless it's a nap during the day or on the weekends when I don't have to wake up for school and can sleep late(I still wake up in between tho). Im 18 and in college but this has been an issue since 8th grade. My girlfriend brought up a sleep study, but I don't really know what to do. I haven't gotten a solid 8 hours in like a year and before that was even longer, I'll be lucky if I have 6 or 5 hours under my belt and at most I usually get 4(still waking up on and off during the night)
NotSignal	Just a general question... I feel it does for me.
Signal	I’m taking Wellbutrin for depression which has increased my anxiety from already having generalized anxiety disorder. The anxiety keeps me up at night until 3 or 4 am and I’m only getting about 4-5 hours of sleep on a good day. My psychiatrist prescribed Ambien for sleep and he told me it could cause sleepwalking or sleep eating. I’ve heard all these horrible stories and added to the fact that it’s addictive is making me scared to take it.
Signal	I have been dealing with poor sleep and little sleep for about a week and a half until I decided to ask my GP for something. I initially wanted Mirtazapine because it was always very helpful for me in the past when I would insomnia. The doc said take Zopiclone as it was specifically developed for helping with sleep issues. I was reluctant but OK.First night I wanted to try to fall asleep without any meds, which I managed to do successfully but I woke up twice during a total 4 hours of sleep. I then decided that in order to get the full 8 I just might as well take Zopiclone. It knocked me out fast but i only got 2 hours of sleep from it. So I sleep from 21:00 - 03:00 and had 6 more hours of the drug in my system while awake. But that was fine. I am dealing with anxiety and the service sedative effect of Zopiclone was very pleasant for those few hours. But I was still sleep deprived.Next day I thought I would the same - fall asleep without Zopiclone and see how it goes. And now I am awake at 03:00 after going to sleep at around 21:00 with the same sleeping pattern + 2 hours of Zopiclone as last night. I feel calm which is great but my sleep dude. I would have requested Xanax if I wanted to be calm.Just funny stuff. This night I want to do it without it whatsoever. Or maybe I should take it just before sleep instead of taking it in the middle of night? Anyone experienced anything like it?
Signal	Sorry if this a mess but I'm not in my element rnI am normally not a very anxious person, I go to sleep very easily 20 minutes max and get at least my 8 hours of sleep.But since yesterday this time I started having a very continuous panic attack That started from browsing horror stories from phenibut as I just got it used it on the 06/10(nothing really special) then again on the 06/17(had the best time of my life) which led me to that negative rabbit hole, It started as a fear of tinnitus ( a man got it from a stronger gaba agent, but he was using phenibut too) and how it ruined this man's life, after rolling for a bit unable to sleep I remembered this fatal insomnia video That I saw a couple of months back and how similar it felt (to me anyway). Now after 24Hours (10:40 pm now) I can't fall asleep my heart is still beating fast, as soon as I start to drift off I suddenly can't breath so my body jerks and I become wide awake. (closest thing I found online is sleep apnea but I don't think it is). And I have GERD it was mainly minor before but now maybe because of the acidity of phenibut Hcl and now eating much these last days and I feel a little burning sensation nothing too crazy and bloating that caused me to throw up water at 7am.L-theanine didn't help, so at 5pm I took phenibut as it helps with anxiety my heart rate is a bit slower(still abnormal) but the breathing problem when trying to sleep still persists and every time it happens I panic so increasing my heart rate.Ps1: I may have asthma from cat allergy but at this time I didn't interact with them and my lungs feel pretty clear (nose not stuffed too)Ps2: I get small panic attacks here and there from exam results, public speaking.... Ps3: The only time I had an episode close to this was last year When I drank too much vodka(last time I drank was 4 months ago) and smoke too much weed(weed generally gave me anxiety quit 5 months ago) I had to go to the ER as I was hallucinating and thought I was dying or going insane, doc gave me Valium took it for 3-4 days and stopped taking it as I didn't need it.Ps4: I'm only on phenibut and l-theanine (no coffee or stimulant)Ps5: I know that phenibut can fuck with your breathing but this started happening while I wasn't on it and the benefits from lower anxiety are until now worth it as I wouldn't have been able to write this without itThe drifting off happened at least 100 times by nowI'm very tired and I just want to sleep. Should I go get Valium and other sleeping aids if I can't sleep tonight
Signal	So I didnt sleep at all last night, again. This didnt used to happen to me, maybe once a year when i got anxious about something, but now its happened 3 times in the past month where i get less than 3 hours of sleep a night. This is usually the pattern, i'll need to go to bed because i have to work early, my bf will turn down the volume but leave the tv on with the room lights off. I'll sleep for maybe 30 or 40 minutes then wake up and be unable to fall back asleep even when the tv goes off. Sometimes i can a few hours later, last night i couldnt and now am going to try and work a full day on about 20 minutes of sleep. The tv being on with the room lights off is the only consistent that i can identify. Even if he has the lamp on and the tv on, but turns both off at the same time before we go to bed, i dont have issues falling asleep.Im wondering if its the harsh light in the dark whereas the light from the lamp may diffuse it and make it softer so my brain isnt overstimulated? Any thoughts? Im just trying to identify what the issue is so i dont have to deal with this anymore. My brain doesnt really race or anything, and i havent really been worried or anxious about anything. I just cant fall asleep even if i lay there for hours trying different relaxation methods.
Signal	Lately I've sort of been paranoid about falling asleep and paying too much attention to my heart beat. I'm really getting frustrated and I don't know how to get rid of this feeling. Cheers to another fun night!
NotSignal	I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this I usually can sleep in thirty minutes or so but the last three days whenever I try to sleep I either just lay in my bed like a brick with my eyes open not drowsy at all just a headache and thinking not even stressful thinking just like what I’m going to do tomorrow or sometimes I go into this like daydreaming mode for hours where you feel unrested and anything can snap you out of it I’ve been super grouchy to my family and have had awe full headaches if this is normal or abnormal any response is welcome
Signal	Hey everyone, allow me to sum myself up* 40/M* Live alone/self-employed (I primarily work in the afternoon until the late evening, ca 22.00)* Bipolar type 1/Seroquel XR/Lithium/Valproate (for what it's worth)I have suffered from insomnia ever since I was a kid. My head was always alert, I often felt like a buzzing light bulb. My folks had difficulty getting me to sleep, which sometimes resulted in a guerrilla on my part of secretly reading, playing, etc, way after bedtime.During puberty/adolescence somewhat less difficulties. When I became depressed at 19, I in fact suffered from severe oversleeping until I was prescribed Luvox (I stopped taking it after my diagnosis of BD type 1). I was diagnosed in 2011, and ever since, a lot has changed. I don't work fulltime anymore. My workweek is irregular. I tutor by the way, so my work involves a lot of mental effort. Anyway, my real question is this.Since my diagnosis, I often try to sleep but it won't work. I am not that overactive kid anymore (btw ADHD has been ruled out), in fact, I feel very tired physically. But it's like my mind is actively keeping my body from falling asleep. It's almost as if I have some undefined fear of letting go. Often, I feel like I am more or less actively fighting it. I am tired, but I am still that kid again that wants to grab a book, or game, or watch youtube. This all generates a lot of tension which has led to an additional issue: (over)eating at night. Often, when I am so angry I can't sleep I irrationally decide to eat, at least that's comforting me a bit. But my weight has increased dramatically over the years, and I want this cycle to stop.I know there are many aspects to this story, many variables in this equation. I am just wondering if anybody recognizes this feeling of either being afraid to fall asleep or feeling psychological resistance despite your body clearly yearning for rest. I exercise a lot btw, it's not because of lack of that.
Signal	I was really freackin sleepy from 10:30 pm to midnight , then I took my meds and I don’t know what I did but didn’t go to bed and instead started to walk around the house, before going to bed. Now i know i should no have done that. What should i do to make sleepy again? I hope it’s not going to be a sleepless night again😭Ok enough venting, who’s up for a chat?🙃
Signal	DOMS always worsens my insomnia. I have definitely noticed that taking NSAIDS/Tylenol helps me fall asleep. I don’t think the pain itself is so severe that it’s preventing me from sleeping, but the inflammatory response of DOMS itself (or whatever it is, the physiology of DOMS is very elusive). Any other tricks for dealing with DOMS and/or exercise-induced insomnia?
Signal	I feel like living in a different timezone. I sleep soundly in the afternoon but cant sleep at night. Rip sleeping schedule. Any suggestions to get back on track? Sometimes melatonin doesn’t work
NotSignal	I have had severe insomnia for years, probably going on 3 years now. There were points of remission, but it has been mostly rampant over my life. I finally found something that made me go 90-95% into remission completely. It was a mixture of two things. The first thing is that I was diagnose with Ulcerative Colitis. The treatment for the colitis prevents me from waking up from pain and not being able to digest food during the night time properly. That wasn't the big kicker though.The thing that actually killed my insomnia, after years of trying many different things, was Buspar. It's an obscure anxiolytic medication. After about 1 month of being on this medication, I can finally go to sleep, without any other assistance medications. It's a miracle. Things are starting to turn around, for the better, health-wise. I just feel so happy something worked, I wanted to share.
Signal	I know a lot of you have got it way worse than me. I wish you guys the best of luck and to not go crazy after sleeping for so little every night.This was supposed to be the day I would sleep for 6 hours at least. This is mad. Slept at 00:40 woke up at 3:10. Two and a half hours of sleep after days. I am so tired. I haven't cried in a long time, but I swear tonight did it. Holy hell.. It's 4:30 now. I'm tired of this same old routine. I want it to end and sleep like a normal person.
Signal	This at first didn’t qualify as insomnia, but I remember telling my mom once when I turned 13 I wanted to stay up until 1 am (on a Friday) because I was a man now. In my mind then how late you staid up or rather how long it would dictate how much of a man you are. Fast forward to college I rarely slept and it didn’t effect me at all to sleep 20 or less hours Mon-Fri and maybe sleep long on Sat & Sun. Fast forward to present.I know the doctors will give out these recommended sleep times for people I usually go to sleep at all different times because I work swing shifts. When I’m on days I’m lucky to be asleep before midnight and usually get up around 3-4 if I sleep at all and when I work nights I usually get to sleep by 7:30-8:30 and up by 1 or earlier.The thing for me is I don’t want to seek out any help even when I don’t sleep at all because I still function fine day to day, just seems like the “help” they would give me would more or less hurt my structure. 4 hours at most and I have a good day more then 4 and I’m groggy and can’t function.
NotSignal	Hi all,Here is my situation:- I'm 40- smoked weed a lot (3.5g per week) pretty much the entire 20-28 y.o. period. Weed was giving me the munchies, like everyone, but i usually managed to handle it well during my awake time but after going to bed, mental defenses went down and I would wake up many times within 20-60 mins after going to sleep, and head straight to the kitchen. I could eat cheese, ice cream, granola bars, cereals,drink coke, chips, olives... in no particularly order. I would wake up and my stomach would feel like crap,. obviously... but I was young so always managed to recover - fast forward to today, I'm 40 yo. Couple of kids. Don't smoke weed anymore. But I still get the night binging. Not as bad as when I smoke weed (I almost never smoke anymore but when I do - OMG the binging is even worse than before) - I'm 220 lbs. Not obese - but could definitely lose 30-40 pounds- my entire life I've been an impulsive eater - put me in front of a bag of chips and it's really hard for me to stop reaching in. I don't even notice im doing it. I can eat and eat and eat until I start to feel sick to my stomach. This is due to my upbringing (was never thought to control urges - grew up in household with "if you want it to can have it" mentality)- I feel totally trapped - the only way to get a good night sleep is when I sleep in a hotel room with no food in the room. At home, I get up almost every night, eat all sorts of shit. Only night where I don't is usually on Saturday, due to a week long sleep deficit. My body just sleeps through the night (not always) And I always feel like crap the next morning. I have terrible, terrible sleep due to this bad habit and it's taking a solid toll on my health.I recently successfully managed to stop smoking cigarettes once and for all (i fought the stop-start smoking again battle for 10+ yrs...) and ery proud of it. I'm now resolved to get rid of this habit and reclaim my health, but don't know where to start.Anyone else going through this? Any ideas?
Signal	How can I help my wife who suffers from insomnia due to PTSD? She wants me to help her but I have no idea what I can do. It doesn’t seem like something that another person can do for someone. She is at her wits end. She’s tried medications, meditation, back rubs when she can’t sleep. She also gets frustrated with me because I fall asleep very easily which is another issue in itself. I have slept on the couch to keep from irritating her with my snoring.
NotSignal	What the fuck is wrong with me? If I take any kind of nap for any length of time I can't sleep until I I literally pass out hours later. My brain will not shut off.
Signal	My wisdom teeth were taken out on Tuesday and I'm supposed to basically sleep sitting up which is not really possible for me. Now I have so much anxiety about sleep I can't sleep at all. Even when I start falling asleep my body panics for some reason. This sucks because obviously I really need rest and I feel like I'm gonna go crazy, I haven't gone this long without sleep for a long time
NotSignal	(TL;DR at the end)They don't believe me that I have problems sleeping. They think I either say that for attention, just use my phone all night or just doing something wrong when I go to sleep, idk. They just tell me to force myself to wake up at 8am everyday until my body get used to sleeping at night.I've been having problems since I was 12. The only times I was ever able to fall sleep immediately was after being awake for more then 18 hours, which makes my day longer then 24 hours and really isn't practical.When I try to sleep I usually start hearing voices. Like, I let my imagination run and that's how all my dreams start, I hear before I see and sometimes I don't even see in dreams. The problem is that sometimes those voices say very disturbing things, or they say the same thing over and over again and it drives me nuts, or they just start yelling, and it wakes me up. The best solution I found was some sleeping music on YouTube. It doesn't makes me fall asleep faster but at least it gives me something more pleasant to hear.I also have problems with my dreams. Almost every night there would be a dream that repeats itself. When it's a long dream that suddenly starts from the beginning it's fine, sometimes even enjoyable depending on the dream, but sometimes it's the same moment over and over and over again, which usually mean I barely get any sleep and keep waking up all night. It also doesn't help that most of my dreams contain people yelling or saying disturbing things, and a lot of disturbing images too.My parents don't believe my problem is real. They always say "What do you want? To take sleeping pills?" sarcastically when I bring it up but honestly if that will help me sleep then I'd be ok with taking a pill, my eyes and head hurt 24/7 and I HATE waking up at 2pm because I fell asleep at 5am and didn't even hear my alarm clock. And what I hate even more is getting up at 4am because I kept waking up all night and just gave up on sleeping.How do I convince them to believe me? If I'll tell them that I "hear voices and it keeps me awake" they'll ask if I want to be locked up in a mental hospital or something.TL;DR - My parents don't believe I can't sleep at night and every time I try to talk about it they think I'm pretending to be crazy or something, and I need help convincing them it's real.
Signal	I’ve had a pretty inconsistent sleep schedule ever since quarantine started, leading to me gradually sleeping later and later until I pull an all nighter and sleep until I wake up at a normal time. I’ve been able to fall asleep without difficulty, but recently I’ve developed sleep maintenance insomnia. I had just stayed awake for 23 hours, slept for 13 hours and waken up at 8am. I still felt pretty tired and eventually went to bed around 2am that night (hoping to wake up at 10am and attempt to keep that sleep schedule for awhile). Instead, I woke up at 8am. The next night I went to sleep at 1am and woke up at 7am. I crashed this day and slept for 5 hours from 2pm to 7pm. I went to bed the following day at 3am and woke up at 8am. Last night, I crashed at 9pm and woke up at 2am, but was able to fall back asleep (recently my mind has been too active to fall back asleep) until 5am. I’m not sure how to fix this problem and I’m worried I’ve caused a permanent problem to my sleeping habits. Any tips/similar experiences/solutions?
Signal	I’ve be up since 7:30 east coast time 12/31 and now it’s 5:30 west coast time 1/2. I’ve been in bed ever since I got home but no sleep. My brain won’t shut off. I took a 3mg lunesta last night in New York and didn’t get any sleep. I took a 50mg Seroquel and a 1mg klonipon on my flight and no sleep (I was also next to a crying baby the whole time) I have to work tomorrow and I’m scared I won’t sleep. I can’t see the doctor for two more weeks. I don’t know what to do. I went off my lithium for my trip because I thought I’d enjoy myself more. It was clearly a bad idea.
NotSignal	I've tried all kinds of sleep apps over the past few years and not a single one has really worked until 2 nights ago. Its called #selfcare on Google play. Idk why but its super soothing to me. Its helped me sleep 2 nights this week sadly it didn't help tonight seeing as its currently 4:38am and I haven't slept a wink. But I figure even just a couple of nights is better than no sleep for nearly a week.
Signal	I've tried every medication and every method to try snd relax to get some sleep but nothings working. I get 4 hours of sleep on average at night, sometimes less. And it takes about 3 or 4 hours to actually get to sleep. I'm so tired and at my wits end. I can't afford any paid cbt insomnia guides or apps.
NotSignal	38 Male 5’9” 205lbs Non smoker no meds Due to a recent positive COVID-19 diagnosis, I have been having anxiety and difficulty sleeping for about a week. I have been getting about 3 hours of sleep every night. For the past 3 nights, I have been going to bed around midnight and then waking up suddenly around 2:30-3am agitated as if I had a bad nightmare and I noted both my arms were numb, just as if I had laid on top of them. I got up and went to the bathroom and I was slowly regaining the feeling on both of them. I am so scared this happened 3 nights in a row. I have been careful not to put any pressure on my arms after the first night but it still happens. Any idea what could be happening? Do I need a prescription for something to help me go to sleep?As for the COVID I’m on my 9th day after the positive diagnosis but haven’t had any of the major symptoms. However I feel the lack of sleep may be more damaging in the long run than the virus.
NotSignal	I’m sorry if this seems like a dumb question, I’m not part of either subs or diagnosed with either of these conditions but I’m asking out of pure curiosity. I thought insomnia and narcolepsy were opposites?
Signal	I've had some mild trouble with falling asleep for a many years, but it started to get worse in the last few years. I've been prescribed some benzodiazepine and they worked out fine, although I've stopped taking them since around 2 months ago. I've also recently tried melatonin and it works even better for falling asleep.But the thing is... I can't get up even if I manage to fall asleep. I wake up so tired that all I can do is try to fall asleep again, and waking up late causes me not be able to sleep at night, and the cycle continues... So I can never fix my sleep schedule.I just can't remember the last time I woke up refreshed in the morning, even if I manage to force myself to get up I'm just gonna be dead tired and sleepy the whole day... Which only gets worse by the meds. And no doctor (even specialists) take it any seriously.
NotSignal	I had so many thoughts in my mind that i find it impossible to really understand if i slept or not. I mean for some moments i was in so high nirvana i didnt move or think but i was still awake i think. I looked at the clock, it was 7 am i dont know if i slept up to that point. For sure i slept a bit after that but at 10am i was awaken by my parents. Does any one else experience this, when you dont know if you are awake or not?
NotSignal	Can lack of sleep cause these issues? It’s been three days I haven’t had good sleep but last night I maybe had one hour... I just wanted to know if anyone deals with this too???
NotSignal	trust me. i thought i did and it made me descend into the worst mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks i've ever had. i promise you that you don't have it. unless you can't remember your own name, talk normally, walk properly, etc, you are fine. it is a rapidly progressing prion disorder. family members, spouses/partners, and friends would most likely notice you have something wrong before you could even notice. i promise you, that if you can type and worry, you are fine.
Signal	Hello everyone, Recently I (22M) have suddenly experienced insomnia for (almost) the first time in my life with very little warning. Its just one night I woke up at 1:30AM and couldn't fall asleep again until 5, and though there have been ups and downs since then, I have got close to 0 sleep for the past two nights. I have no history of Insomnia (I have always slept very well), or Anxiety (though a bit of it exists in my family) and I really am at my wits end. I am exhausted but I cannot sleep. The idea of going to bed now causes me fear, that once I get in and get comfy sleep just will not come. Like many of you, I am always having worries that this is somehow the onset of Sporadic Fatal Insomnia (despite the obvious impossibility of this), but to be quite honest I just wish I knew why I am suddenly unable to sleep. Most of the threads I looked at here say that their sleeping problems started when they were children, but has anyone here had their insomnia start for no reason in their early 20's? I'm just looking for some kind of reassurance that I'm not doomed to die in pain like this and that there are natural causes for my severe, sudden insomnia. A couple notes: I saw a doctor today, she gave me a referral to a therapist/counselor in recognition of my Hypochondria of SFI and general fear of the situation, she also said that physical symptoms such as insomnia can precede psychological symptoms of Anxiety. Additionally, she told me to get some OTC Melatonin and get blood work done to rule out things like Thyroid issues, Iron Issues and Diabetes (Can that cause insomnia?), we have a followup appointment in three weeks to talk about that. The only event in my life I can think of as a possible cause for the insomnia is that about a month ago (December 26th) I quit a job that had me falling asleep at 4AM (Evening shift) and then I moved away to attend University. However, the first two weeks after leaving the job I did not have any sleep issues. Sorry for the text wall, I've had less than three hours of sleep in the past two days, If anyone had their insomnia start in the early 20's I would really like to hear your experience so I can know I'm not alone and won't go crazy and die. Thanks.
Signal	Srsly. I can't keep doing this. It takes me hours to fall asleep. And then I fall asleep, and I can't stay asleep more than. 3/4 hours at time, if that. Why? Cuz I have to fucking pee. Every 2-4hours. And if I don't drink before bed I'm awake and thirsty. I've been to a doctor I don't have diabetes. We're gonna do some kidney testing but it's not gonna solve my insomnia. It might help, which would be amazing, but I can't do antidepressants again. Absolutely notAnd Ambien is entirely too strong. If antidepressants made me feel like a zombie Ambien makes me feel like the dam jackal from 13 ghosts. Fucking delirious crazy out of it. Since I started working overnights, it's so much worse. At this point it's sleep deprivation, since it takes me 1.5 hrs to get home, like 2 hours to make.lunch for the night take a shower and actually get to bed, and then I get maybe a 6 hour window to fall sleep (not happening ) and if I'm lucky I get 4 hours and then it's back on the road for another 12-13 hr shift. No I don't work in a people hospital. I'm sure my job has a part to play, as well as my kidneys, my depression, my anxiety...but fuck. Fuck insomnia fuck feeling so tired ur nauseous and fuck being mentally fucked. I hate this.
NotSignal	So to preface I've never dealt with anything like insomnia. My sleep schedule has been pretty fucked lately (I end up going to bed around 5-6 am and waking up around 12-3 pm) but the thing is that sleep was pretty consistent. I hit the sheets at the same time every night and just doze off till morning.Well yesterday I tried going to bed earlier randomly after going to bed at 5 am for weeks and I think that somehow fucked with me. Didn't get a wink of sleep until like 6 AM so i decided to get up and just continue my day with no sleep. Evening comes around and I go to bed at around 11 PM and I don't fall asleep AT all. It's currently 3 AM and I pretty much decided to get out of bed because clearly it isn't working. I don't think this is insomnia (i really hope it isn't) and it's just my brain not used to going to sleep at these times. Any ideas?
Signal	Just before I fall asleep, my body flinches, and it wakes me up. I didn’t fall asleep once last night, and I slept about an hour the night before. It feels like things are touching me before I fall asleep and it’s scaring me. I looked it up and all I got were hypnogogic jerks. Does anyone have any idea how to make this stop. I’m so tired.
Signal	For the past several nights I fall asleep easily but without fail wake up after appx. 4 hours of sleep, then have trouble falling back asleep and toss and turn the rest of the night in fits and wakes of only light sleep. I am in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy; however, years ago this same problem (of only staying asleep 4 hours) happened to me when I wasn’t pregnant. Back then when it happened I know I was having a lot of anxiety and depression. But I don’t feel that way now...except of course some anxiety over Covid-19 like that rest of the world. And I even went back to taking Trazodone...which used to keep me asleep at least 7 hours. Now nothing is working...I of course have been trying/using all the “usual” recs like magnesium, lavender pillow spray, etc. Wondering if anyone has or had this same insomnia problem of having no problem falling asleep but instead can’t stay asleep? And if there is any different way to “treat” this?
NotSignal	Well I am on vacation and I went to the local pharmacy and asked for zz pills/aids and they gave me this... I can't read Thai so I just took what they offer until tonight I decided to take them and then I realized that those pills aren't zz aids…
Signal	So my doctor prescribed me 2mg of Lunesta. It helped the first week and then soon it took 4 meg to get to sleep. I’ll take it on an empty stomach, I’ll go straight to bed with no distractions. No phones, nothing.And now all I’m left with is a literal bitter taste in my mouth.I’m so, so tired. I’ve tried everything people have recommended. I’m so done. I was wondering if others have used Lunesta, have advice, anything?
Signal	Its almost 3 am and im currently chillin at my neighborhood park chain smoking. My insomnias always been awful but lately i fucked myself over even worse than before by developing a heroic tolerance to lyrica/gabapentin and kratom, not to mention post-acute benzo withdrawal. Anyone else up right now? Any of yall have substance abuse involved in your insomnia too?
NotSignal	So I’ve failed at CBT-I (in that I no longer keep track of my sleep in my journal) but I try to follow the rules it sets up. Mainly, going to bed and getting out of bed at the sane time regardless of how much I’ve slept. The thing is, for me, this adherence to a strict schedule is making my anxiety worse. For instance, I was supposed to fall asleep two hours ago, but failed. I have to give up on sleep in 4 hours, and the thought that I may get less than hours of sleep is making me anxious which means I‘m not going to fall asleep anytime soon. Mind you, I took 1mg of klonopin an hour ago, and it doesn’t seem to be working at lowering my anxiety. I’m now here, venting, to see if that will reduce my anxiety. The point is, schedules in general are stressful for me, and I’m feeling like sleep schedules are making my problems worse. I understand the logic behind the sleep schedule, but maybe it doesn’t work on particularly anxious people?...That’s the thing that frustrates me with CBT-I: it just feels like there’s no flexibility in the program for different types of people.
Signal	So I had posted a long lengthy dramatic post about my story and extreme insomnia and weird sleep patterns that have persisted for 4 months.Unfortunately the insomnia and exhaustion still persist and seem to be progressive . I am getting REM sleep but it’s very light and vivid and non rejuvenating, and I always get forcefully “bounced” out of every dream and have to will myself to go back to sleep. This means longer and longer periods in bed unfortunately, and I’m almost starting to get stuck in a spot in between dreaming and wakefulness. As for my physical condition, it’s getting harder to walk and stand for long periods of time. I am trying to do what I can physically but my muscles are not getting the deep sleep repair they need. I do swimming at night to try and keep my upper body somewhat strong and it’s easier on the joints.. it’s definitely a hellish situation with no quality of life.As for the doctors, I’m going to try and push my neurologist to refer me for a PET scan and sleep study to figure out what’s really going on now. Many of these doctors attribute things like this to anxiety but the deterioration of my physical condition and sleep patterns cannot be attributed to just that. My immunity is also down because of this and I have thrush which is candida overgrowth. I don’t mean to alarm any of you, as obviously this is an unusual case of secondary insomnia. (Insomnia caused by something other than just anxiety). I’ll continue to post updates as I can.
NotSignal	Anyone else here get fed up with constantly yawning and having any hope that this will be it. This is my time for sleep. These 20min to 2hr stints, just not fun anymore.
NotSignal	Would it theoretically be safe to take Trazodone or Seroquel while on Effexor, I have concerns that the outcome will result in serotonin syndrome.
Signal	So I’ve never been one to sleep easily. When i was a kid, I slept in bed with my mother for far too many years because I was too anxious to sleep alone. Even so, I still remember staying awake half the night trying to fall asleep. I didn’t really start sleeping alone until my family moved and I began sharing a room with my sister. This relieved some of the anxiety of being alone, but I still did not sleep through the night. Both of my parents are hardcore insomniacs. This has caused them to take over the counter sleep aids for the last couple of decades, maybe more. After getting exasperated at my lack of sleep, I explained to my mother my frustration. At first, I took melatonin- didn’t work. Then valerian root- no effect. Then, I moved onto taking small doses of over the counter meds. From ages 14-18 I took diphenhydramine. I started with 1 pill, and by the end had built up such a strong tolerance and was taking about 4 or 5. I am fully aware this is a bad and dangerous habit. This caused me to change to taking Unisom. That’s been successful, but again, I’ve built up this tolerance and am taking way too high a dosage at 22. I’ve tried so many times to stop these pills. To try and sleep without anything. But then I don’t sleep for two weeks and I’m constantly frustrated at my lack of sleep and exhaustion. I can sometimes fall asleep at first- then sleep about two hours before being wired again. Or- sometimes I can’t sleep at all until I become completely exhausted around 6am. I’m currently writing this at 3 am after sleeping 2 hours. I’m so tired of this. I can’t keep taking over the counters- I know it’s dangerous and bad for me. I would love any advice as so what direction I should take. I know I have anxiety and lots of trauma (don’t we all?! ;) ) so I should probably¿ go see a psychiatrist about this issue? How do I go about making the appointment and all that jazz? Am I going to have to prove that I don’t sleep? If I receive sleeping aids for my issues, is that an unhealthy dependence too? So many questions. My parents haven’t ever been too adamant about getting help for these kinds of things, so I’m in the dark. Sorry if some of my questions sound absurd. Thank you for reading this and for any wisdom you may bestow upon me! If you have any magic tricks for sleep, please send my way- PLEASE, for the love of god, though, counting sheep doesn’t work, I can’t meditate, I do exercise during the day, none of this stuff helps me.
Signal	I can’t fall asleep and I am absolutely exhausted rn so this really sucks. The reason why is I’m really anxious rn and each time I try to fall asleep I’ll have heart palpitations and this makes it even harder to relax. It’s a never ending loop . Does this happen to anyone else and if so, do you have any tips?
NotSignal	I've always been blessed with the ability to sleep extremely quick and well. The last couple of weeks I have started to struggle with sleeping. The biggest issue is running through all the regrets in my life and how I'm in a terrible situation in my life ( which I'm in the process of Fixing). A feeling of overwhelming sadness and regret that stops me from switching off my mind and falling into sleep. I can put in a hard shift in the gym and still have this feeling of pure lucidity when I lie in my dark room. I've been sad before but it had never stopped me from sleeping. What do I do?
Signal	I have had insomnia for about 3 years now. I was originally put on Seroquel, but after a few months my body got used to it- that, and I found out about the awful side effects of that medication so I wanted off that as soon as possible. I was then put on Klonopin, but I got used to that after a couple of months. Now I am in the same boat with Trazodone- I won't fall asleep whether or not I take it. Even when I increased the dosage by a pill (from 2 pills to 3 pills), I would stay awake the whole night without relief. The past 3 weeks have been the worse insomnia in my life, I can't sleep no matter how exhausted I am at night. I'll stay up until well into the next day's afternoon, fall asleep for a generous 2-3 hours, and repeat the cycle. Reluctantly, I tried to self medicate with marijuana and alcohol, but even in an intoxicated state, I would still not sleep!Last night, along with my prescribed medicine, I took two 1200 mg capsules of Valerian root. And I was so surprised to find myself yawning about an hour later. I FINALLY GOT 8 HOURS OF SLEEP!!! I woke up 2 times through the night, looked at the clock, and instantly fell asleep again. Although I am not sure how long the effectiveness of this will last, I am relieved to have at least a temporary respite from the suffering.
NotSignal	And please don’t say melatonin. I am sick of people irl constantly telling me “just take melatonin brah”. I dont need to hear it anymore. I need something better thats non nuerotoxic and not illegal. What has worked for you guys?
Signal	I dont know exactly whats causing it ive been to the doctors they basically tell me to get over it which i cant cause i start work at 6am and i cant fall to sleep until like 1 some mornings but some days im fine. i stopped smoking weed a fair while ago cause of a collapsed lung but when i was smoking it was the only time in my life i have got a good sleep hence to why a started smokinga. Ive been taking over the counter doxylamine succinate but ive heard they can make it worse if you keep using them and i cant take them no longer than 2 days like ill get real tired get into bed and have the most energy ive had all day Tbh another collapsed lung is worth getting a good sleep considering i work on roofs and with heights most days and some days i dont feel safe doing my job and i dont want it to cause a accident and hurt myself or even work someome else cause i only got 4 or 5 hours sleep Any suggestions what works or even how to get the doctor to take me serious like i understand there alot of people that just try to get drugs for the sake of it but i dont like taking prescriptions but if its going to help ill do it
Signal	So lately I’ve been going through some shit. Super stressed out and full of anxiety (won’t go into details). I desperately want to sleep and I’ll take melatonin around 9:00 pm and it makes me tired and I feel like I’m ready to sleep. Most nights I lay there, trying to sleep but end up just laying there tossing and turning. My mind races with a million different thoughts. My problem is, I work 12 hour shifts starting at 6am and ending at 6pm. How can I work 12 hours with only a few hours of sleep?! Any advice would be appreciated
Signal	Hi! I'm an 18 male. My doctor prescribed me quetiapine 25mg for insomnia, at first I got scared because it is an antipsychotic, but my sleep schedule is so f*cked up that I bought it anyway. I was on Ambien 10mg the whole last year but at one point it stopped working, I just that horrible 'ambien high' but still couldn't sleep. Also keep in mind that I just raised my Paxil from 20 to 40mg. The first night I took only 25mg, half of the dose I was supposed to take and it worked fine, I slept for like 2 hours and then woke up all sweaty even though my room wasn't hot at all.The next night I decided to sleep almost naked and take the 50mg, it didn't seem to work and I had trouble falling asleep, when I finally did I woke up all sweaty and nasty again.So, what are your thoughts? Should I keep trying it on different doses? Does anyone had similar experiences on it? Anyways, thanks for reading. :) I miss sleeping.
NotSignal	I can’t sleep even when I’m sleepy. it’s always tinnitus, tingling, brain zaps, body itching, etc... I haven’t been asleep for a while, I can’t be productive, i tried listening to music, only xanax make me sleep. But stuff’s addictive
NotSignal	I fell asleep early at about 10:40PM. I felt accomplished because I was going to get 8 hours of sleep on a school night. But then I wake up at 2:15AM? I’m more awake than I am after waking up from a good 5 hour sleep. Why did this happen?
NotSignal	I found a YouTube channel called Jason Stephenson. He does sleep talk downs, insomnia sleep therapy music and more. I have actually slept 6-8 hours that past 4 nights which is a record for years!! Another great one is deep sleeptube! My All time favorite videos are: “fall asleep fast and easy-432 hz” channel: powerthoughts meditation Jason Stephenson sleep talk down (it has 11million views)
NotSignal	I just realized that some of my insomnia must come from the bedroom. I still live at home and my parents did it. The walls are painted cream and the ceiling is white. White wardrobes also.The curtains are practically see through and light blue..I remember complaining so much about them because the sun literally shines on me directly from outside. So they put the same curtain over to make 2 layers.. it did improve it slightly but not much. I had a dark purple curtain before and I think it ripped so they put on this shitty blue one. I'm going to try to get blackout curtains and paint the room a dark color.
NotSignal	Hi guys, I dealt with insomnia for a long time (caused by post-concussion syndrome following an accident). I saw many specialist, including neurologists, sleep clinics, psychiatrists, psychologists, got 2 MRIs done, etc. I want to share with you some insight into common causes of insomnia in healthy individuals.And before you glance over this and dismiss it, ask yourself, do you ALREADY do these things? And no, don't shrug off the exercise & diet part because it REALLY DOES affect your sleep. And no, trying it for 1 day doesn't count. It has to be LONG TERM, we're talking minimum several weeks before you start seeing benefits.**1. Vitamin deficiency.**Particularly vitamin D and b12. Now that everyone is indoors most of the time due to the pandemic, it is very likely that many of you are likely deficient to some degree. Vitamin D is NOT part of your yearly checkup. The doctor would only order it if they have a reason to believe you're deficient. Often times they dismiss this altogether, even if you are showing symptoms of fatigue, trouble sleeping, etc.I was advised to take 2000iu in LIQUID form (capsules) during the day, with some form of calcium. And then take magnesium citrate 200-300mg at night, about 1 hr before sleeping. (sleep clinic's neurologist advised this)**2. Blue light**This is EXTREMELY important. Do NOT use screens at least 3 hours before bedtime. Some things you can do: Read a book, listen to podcast or audiobook (but don't spend time browsing and staring at your phone), play a board game, take up a hobby like drawing (on paper), etc.Do NOT browse reddit at night, especially not in bed.Install blue light filters on all your devices and set it to follow the natural cycles of the sun in your area. I.e. it should start turning kinda red around sunset. If you can afford it, get blue light blocking glasses for work hours.DO get blue light in the morning, especially during winter time. (they have broad spectrum lamps, or SAD (seasonal affective disorder) lamps.**3. Exercise & diet**Exercise during the day and get your heart rate to at least 60%. Do strength training and High Intensity Interval training. Do NOT exercise.Drink plenty of water during the day, Stop all water consumption 1 hour before bedtime. Pee before sleeping.Eat a balanced diet. Supplement with Omega 3. Do not eat caffeine (chocolate, coffee, tea, coke) past 2pm. Do not eat (especially sugars) at least 3 hours before bedtime.**4. Sleeping environment**Use the bed ONLY for sleeping (and sex), and only go when you are tired and ready to sleep. All phone/laptop/gaming/tv should take place in the living room.Make sure your bed is clean, and there are no random objects on your bed except for pillow, blankets and no more than 1 plushie. Try showering at night, sometime before bedtime.When it's bedtime, make your room cool and comfortable. Shut all lights and blinds. Reduce noise. You might need to wear a blindfold and wear earplugs if the situation merits it.**5. If all else fails**SEE a doctor because you likely have a different condition like I did. I required medication.
NotSignal	Sometimes when I’m about to sleep I get a weird pulsing feeling on the right side of my body, is that a hypnic jerk?
NotSignal	I thought that i had found the perfect technique to fall asleep by putting myself no pressure to sleep. Every single night of this week I slept between 5 and 6 hours, sometimes even 7. I slept from 10:40 pm to 00:37 and after that I layed in bed for 3 HOURS after doing some breathing . fck fck fck. Then I stood up from bed and now im just chilling on the couch wondering what to do... Any ideas? (oh btw its 4am)
NotSignal	Currently its 10:35 PM and I go to bed at like 11 and I am sitting in the couch rn in the living room and I feel kind of dizzy, I am sweating and it feels as if somebody is putting pressure in my nose like it feels heavy or something.
NotSignal	Does anyone know of ways to sleep that have been really effective??? Need some suggestions for someone
NotSignal	I need another sleep tracker. I don't need anything beyond inputting when I fall asleep and wake up. Must be Android. Help!🙏Edit by Android I meant an app, preferably free. I can't afford a device.
Signal	Okay so instead of posting in everyones thread, im going to leave this here.So as most here. Ive had major sleeping issues. I couldnt fall asleep, and if/when i did. Id wake back up in 2 hours.I tried THC/CBD. Worked for a couple days, but then found id just wake up in 2 hours (when it wore off)I read alot, listened to podcasts.I tried relaxation exercises. Removing blue light, getting hydration right, avoid caffeine etc. Nothing.So i used Circadian years ago as a shift worker. Melatonin (The hormone, script required. Not the natural version)On a Pod cast, the Dr talked about Melatonin. He went on to say its no magic cure. It wont help h sleep if your wired on caffeine, or stressed or have poor sleep hygiene etc. He went on to say that it only helps those with Melatonin deficiency. Examples of this, not being able to stay asleep, once asleep.Bingo.So 4 days ago, i went online, got a script, paid $30 for the tablets.Now, for the last 3 nights, i have fallen asleep easy AND stayed asleep.So perhaps look into this. Its non addictive with almost non negative side effects. Its not a sleeping pill though, remember that. When you wake up, you feel fresh.
NotSignal	The solution is to simply imagine a diverse set of things one after the other, so you may imagine a car for a few seconds then imagine a foggy morning next. This works because the brain has evolved to determine whether it’s safe to fall asleep by checking what one specific part of the brain, the cortex, is doing. If it’s engaged in “sense-making” activity, that’s a sign it may be weighing up dangers. But if thoughts have degenerated into rambling nonsense, the coast is probably clear. By filling the mind with nonsense, you trigger the sleep switch. Yet the technique also works for a simpler reason: it’s hard to focus on multiple things at once. While you’re busy generating a mental image of a microphone, it’s tricky to fret about your bills.I have an app that does all the work for you but you have to pm me otherwise this post gets put down. You can also do it yourself, it’s just harder to think or completely random things without an algorithm, here it is:1. Pick a letter ar random2. Visualize a word that starts with that letter. It should be something you can picture and is emotional neutral (no clowns, airplanes, snakes)3. Continue thinking of new words that start with that letter. So if you choose a llolipop, you might picture a landmark, a lemmon, a ladder. Make sure to pause in between each word.4. When you get bored with your letter, move on to the next. Don’t get creative and make up any stories about any of the words.5. Keep going until you zzz. You should be asleep within 20 minutes.All I ask in return is your thoughts/advice. This is the only way we researchers could make progress in this really difficult field. This is not a silver bullet but we believe it is a bit of a breakthrough in sleep and want to try it with as much people as possible.
Signal	I wanted to ask any fellow insomniacs on here if when they decided to quit using drugs and alcohol did it take them a long time to start being able to sleep ?I was addicted to a wide array of opiates and my drug of choice, gabapentin, for years. Ever since the coronavirus started I kinda stopped being able to get these drugs which makes me feel bad because it's not even like I voluntarily made the decision to quit using drugs it just kind of happened. I'm wondering how long it actually takes after completely quitting drugs to start getting sleep.
Signal	Hello, this post is not about me, it’s for/about my mom... She is 39 years old and she is a very bad insomniac. It’s gone to the point where her skin hurts, if her hair touches her skin it hurts, her skins cracking, a lot of her lymph nodes are swelling, and lastly she keeps complaining that she’s itchy and is trying not to tear her skin off. She keeps thinking she’s hearing things, she is forgetting everything, she is just having a lot of problems in general. Mom says melatonin doesn’t help, and she has gone to the doctor before. I’m worried for my mom, because I love her, and I want to know if there’s anyway to help her sleep, without hitting her over the head with a frying pan or chloroforming her. I do not condone chloroforming, no we have not done chloroforming. Why would we do chloroforming, that could kill her, that is not okay :( .But I have threatened to hit her over the head with a frying pan to knock her out as a joke.So yeah, if there’s any good ways to help my mom sleep please tell me. Thank you, -Husky
Signal	i am posting this because it has helped me so much and will probably help so many others. magnesium citrate is a godsend when it comes to insomnia ... this is the first thing everyone who has insomnia should try ... i had been suffering from insomnia for years. my insomnia was so bad that at times i couldnt sleep for several days even with the doctor prescribing trazadone. Most nights i would lay in bed from 12 am til 4 or 5 am before i finally fell asleep then had to be back up at 730. If i was lucky id fall asleep around 2 or 3 am after laying in complete silence and and darkness for 3+ hours. i tried everything melatonin, marijuana, antihistamines etc and nothing worked at all. then one day i read about insomnia being a symptom of magnesium deficiency and most people in the us are magnesium deficient. so i went and bought some magnesium citrate. i took 2 pills every evening for a week. the FIRST night i fell asleep as soon as i layed down at around 11 oclock and woke up refreshed before my alarm at 7am. i took it everynight for a week with great sleep each night, then one day i wanted to see if i could skip doses so i didnt take it. Fell asleep right away that night. Each day i would try not taking it just to see how long i could go without taking it again. its been almost 3 weeks now and i havent had to take it again since. I am getting the best sleep i have had since i was in my early 20s. Bottom line it didnt just help my insomnia, it actually cured it. The years i have wasted not knowing about this simple fix is unbelieveable.
NotSignal	I have taken a long break from zoplicone it has worked it has worked wonders for me. How long on an empty stomach should I take it
Signal	I had really gotten things under control. This time last year I would stay up for days at a time but until recently my sleep schedule had been pretty normal. Then last week all the sudden I can't sleep all night again. I'm so pissed off. My brain is wide awake but I don't want to do anything productive or even fun. I feel so stupid for not being able to sleep because I know a lack of sleep will make my other health conditions worse but like here I am. I don't know if it's just because it's too hot in my apartment or what but I know exactly what I'm in for because I've been here before and the future looks shit. Sorry for the rant I just am really annoyed with myself
NotSignal	I went to sleep at 1:00Am! This is the earliest I’ve fallen asleep in over six months. After running on nearly 2-5 hours of sleep everyday this felt so good. I normally go to bed at 4-5 AM and I’m so happy, I just wanted to say that I hope all of you get better! I’m so happy rn!
Signal	I have been having anxiety about sleeping for around 2 months now. I've always had anxiety but it's becoming more focused towards sleep. I usually don't have issues sleeping. Melatonin and L-Theanine usually works and I don't feel that much drowsiness when I take it, though it still exists. The main issue is that there are nights where I have anxiety constantly. This anxiety came around after I pulled 3 all-nighters in one week because I was hyper-focused on the time and I was incredibly bored. This is mainly an anxiety issue but this sub would probably be the best because insomnia is kind of like a side effect of it. (Sorry for the bad grammar, my grammar sucks and I'm on mobile)
NotSignal	I’ve been trying to sleep for 5 hrs and I need to wake up for school at 6:15, I’ve been struggling to sleep for about a month- 2 months now, I hate it. :(((
Signal	This insomnia can really make stress build up (Atleast it has for me). It can really be mentally and physically damaging. So, how are you doing and how are you handling it?
Signal	this past 21 days i've been having odd nights,when i go to bed i feel like i'm not going to sleep,then i sleep and wake up after 5 to 7 hours to urinate and when i try to go back to sleep i sit in bed knowing that i will not sleep but sleep and time passes and i feel like i didn't sleep anything,and i go through the day feeling tired,sleepy and with difficulty thinking concentrating.i'm sorry if this is not the place for such a question,but i've been searching all over and found nothing to help me with this,i don't drink caffeine,my last meal is 4-5 hours before sleep.i was taking magnesium supplements prescribed to me by an Otolaryngologist for my throat and ever since i stopped taking them i started having this sleeping issue accompanied by slight tight sensation in the heart and sometimes taking deep breaths.
NotSignal	It's 230am and I can't sleep and I feel like crap :( I'm so freaking sick of not getting any real sleep. I've had 2 sleep studies and the only thing I learned is that I *don't* have sleep apnea. I am 99% positive that my problem is that I don't get any delta sleep, only the lighter stages of sleep.I spent some time with a friend and tried a somewhat unconventional medication. After taking it, I would fall into delta sleep. However, I would begin to snore and would wake myself up, over and over again. So basically, I'm screwed :/
NotSignal	I think for the past 2 and a half years I could not fall asleep before 3am. Lately it's been 5/6am. It's been heavily impacting my grades and my concentration but I don't really know what to do anymore. A friend gave me the advice to wake up earlier and to go to sleep earlier in turn but it didn't work well. Then I tried those fall asleep videos in youtube but it didn't work either. Do you guys have any more tips? I prolly gonna visit the doctor next week if things don't improve.
NotSignal	I doubt I can sleep so wanna chat anyone :p
Signal	I was up late working on some projects and I said to myself, "alright it's almost 1am, I'll go to sleep at 1:30, I'm getting sleepy anyhow". At 1:30 I was no longer sleepy and before I knew it, the sun was coming in through the window. Now, I'm not tired but I know I'm going to feel like crap for the rest of the day. Anyway, now that I'm wide awake with 0 hours of sleep, I thought this would be the perfect time to come on here and introduce myself. I'm fairly new to Reddit and definitely new to this subreddit, but I look forward to chatting and getting to know some of you!
Signal	I'd like to hear from ppl who have been in long term zopiclone.Any bad effects from it? I been on it for about 3 years now and am worried bit I just can't sleep without it. I also take trazadone, quetiapine and Vortioxetine for my BPD and severe depression and anxiety.Also take tamoxifen as had breast cancer last year. Thanks
Signal	...but what you may not now is that I took 20 mg (yes, huge fucking tolerance) of Xanax, 10 mg of Valium, some Zolpidem and like 6 or 7 shots of hard liquor.And now I'm just lying down in my effing bed like always (only under influence) feeling like I want to claw my eyes out. I read this book called "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker a while ago. It's a really good book, very informative and has lots of tips for improving sleep quality and quantity. It's mostly about the science of the hole mumbo jumbo.My biggest issue in terms of sleep problems, ever since I was a child, has been sleep onset insomnia. I'm very well aware that benzos, alcohol and sleeping pills don't actually produce naturalistic sleep (they disrupt REM sleep stage, fragment sleep and worsen the overall quality of sleep). "Sedation is not sleep" Matthew WalkerI've been clean from tobacco and nicotine use for longer than I've ever been (15 days and counting; It's a struggle, let me tell you; DON'T EVER START THIS SHIT) but I'm still hooked on caffeine like Alphys on Undyne's text messages (if you get this, I love you lol). I daily consume (some of you may scoff at this and not believe it) on average 2 liters of home brewed black coffee (no sugar). Without it, I can't focus on reading books or anything really. I just can't function.Caffeine as an adenosine receptor antagonist delays sleep onset time and very often disguises itself as true sleep onset insomnia. Not the case for me. I've had this issue since I was 12. It also worsens NREM sleep (stage 3 and 4 the most) with worsening of an average amplitude of deep sleep NREM waves and reduction of sleep spindles. It also as most of you probably know delays the buildup of adenosine (aka "sleep pressure" chemical) which normally grows in concentration the longer you stay awake and as a result makes it hella lot more challenging to fall asleep when you want to. I could talk about this for hours but I won't. Reason: I don't have many left 'till I have to go do "very" productive stuff like reading "The Shining" again or playing "The Darkside Detective" on Steam. Check that game out. Or don't. Your call.My life just sucks in general and as it's 3 AM at my place it seems like a perfect time to rant about this kinda shit. I'm sure that if I had a regular sleep schedule, if I was off of drugs completely (alcohol, benzos, zolpidem, caffeine), if I was in a more stable mental state just prior to falling asleep and many other factors I could change and influence... I would sleep better (quality and quantity would be increased and as a result daytime wakefulness more stabilised and worthwile living for).I don't know if I have real medical insomnia and I'm certainly not expecting a diagnosis from you guys lol. So don't take offense if my words don't resonate with you. If you read this so far, here, have a cookie... that's filled with coronavirus vaccine (we really didn't need that crap as well).Jesus Christ am I random. Anyways, have a good night if you can. I certainly won't. At least not tonight.P.S. I really recommend Matthew's book. If you don't wanna buy it, there's a Joe Rogan Experience on YouTube wirh professor Walker on. Totally worth watching imo. Touches on most important points. Sweet Dreams...(Are Made Of This)... And what is "This" in reality? I'd really like to know.
Signal	Hi, I was just prescribed Trazodone a few days ago. When I took it the first day I was able to fall asleep, and the second day without it. On the third day I got no sleep so I decided to wait 28 hours before taking another one because I wanted to sleep at night (not during the day). I did take it, but I got so scared from the way it suddenly made me feel so groggy, I was too scared to fall asleep. 3 hours later I can't sleep. I would like to take it because I didn't sleep for almost 30 hours the day before. . The doctor did only prescribe 50 mg per day. I can't see that doctor because he's not my family doctor but rather, A doctor I saw in the emergency at the hospital. I want to know if I can cut the 50mg in half and take some more. Would 75 mg be safe to take in one day? I don't know why I can't sleep. This is the first time in my life that I couldn't sleep at all and I had to get a prescription to sleep. In this past week, I've only gotten 26 hours of sleep.
NotSignal	I remember being relieved to get to bed and sleep. Now it feels like a job & a battle, it really is performance anxiety and I honestly don’t know if it will ever go away. It’s making me insanely depressed, even when I get adequate sleep I still feel like “What could happen the next day?”Sometimes I wish for death, but sometimes I just wanna keep fighting to get my life back. I feel like a prisoner to my own brain.Very depressing, but anyone feel the same?
NotSignal	I’m new to this sub and hoping a “here’s what works for me” post is appropriate.For context, I had severe insomnia for years. At one point I couldn’t sleep for 8 days straight. Absolutely, incredibly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone in the world. I still have it from time to time, but I find that when I do the following, I can catch some of those sweet z’s:- cutting out caffeine entirely - no tv/phone at LEAST 1 hr before you go to bed- making your bed as comfortable as possible and ONLY using it for sleep, reading (not on a screen), journaling, drawing and/or sex- getting outside in the fresh air and sun before 9am (tells your brain that the day is long)- cardio for at least 15 mins a day (sucks but it tires out your body and gets easier with time) - practicing meditation (also sucks but also gets easier with time. You learn to shut down intrusive thoughts)- I also cut out alcohol, but I know that can be a really hard one. The closer you drink to bedtime, the more it affects your quality of sleepThese really all suck at first, I can’t lie. But once you get used to them and your sleep improves, your life gets so much better and they all become a lot easier. It’s really worth it, I promise. Best of luck and feel free to DM or comment for more info.
Signal	I’ve tried melatonin, usually gives me mood swings Tried zzzquil, said take 2, I took 4, doesn’t workTried working out in the day, and reading late nights, I’m wide awake.Beer/liquor/marijuana/cbd Nothing really puts me to sleep, sleep. Any other suggestions?
NotSignal	Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else on here. I have tried many MANY things to combat insomnia and have never had any luck. Strong sleep drugs can take the edge off but aren’t effective on me, which means I have to increase doses when I neeeed to sleep, which I think is less healthy than not sleeping, so I rarely use them. I live in Canada, where cannabis is legal, I’ve smoked lots with friends in the past and barely get high - even when keeping pace with heavy users, I’ve also tried lots of edibles and oils, never had the positive effects like pain relief or better sleeps. So I resigned to cannabis not being helpful for me. This week I threw my back out and was in 10/10 pain, literally no position that would relieve the pain, and the kicker was that I couldn’t take my normal meds because I also had a stomach ulcer, so ibuprofen and other nsaids were off the table. Massage/chiro and other go-tos for pain management were also off the table because they’re all closed. I was basically desperate for pain relief and decided to give edible cannabis oil another chance. I have 50/50 THC CBD blend at home, so the first night I tried that, increased doses slowly over a few hours and ended up at 30 mg of each, with no effect (for reference, 1-15mg is generally advised for normal users). The next day, desperate for pain relief and sleep, I went and bought a bunch of options that would allow me to play with the CBD:THC ratio. I got CBD oil and 2 strains of THC oil (sativa and indica), these were mostly pure but have a tiny bit of the other in them as they always do. First I tried high CBD with a low sativa THC, 3:1 ratio. It started out as I dreaded, a whole lot of nothing. I had started taking normal doses mid afternoon, taking more each 60-90 minutes as I had no symptoms, went to bed around 2am, in excruciating pain with no real hope of sleep, I took one more big dose of each in a Hail Mary. At this point I was at a total of 90 mg of CBD and 30 mg of THC, thus far with no effect. And then, at 4am, it just kicked in. I went from a 10/10 to a 1/10 pain INSTANTLY. I did not feel head high at all, just relaxed, I feel asleep within half an hour of the pain stopping, slept soundly for about 5 hours, woke up to my alarm and felt good, not groggy as I expected.I have since tried 4:3 ratio, 80mg CBD: 60mg THC (sativa still). Again spread out as I ramped you usage to avoid to a real high since my goal is to find something functional not fun. This had a couple short bursts of head high, decent pain relief, and I slept quite well. And I tried 1:2, with only 25 mg CBD and 50mg THC (lower overall doses but I took it over much less time). According to my research a lot of chronic pain sufferers prefer a ratio like this because the THC gives their head a break from the pain rather than just easing the pain, if that makes sense. Overall it was okish for my pain, had a couple bursts of head high, and had an average sleep for me (took several hours to fall asleep and woke up several times, but I did notice that the wake ups were quite chill, I fell back a sleep way faster than usual). Allll of this to say, I’m really excited to see where this takes me. I would NEVER have taken so much cannabis had I not been in so much pain without being able to take my usual pain meds nor being able to get treatment. I’m oddly grateful for the fact I couldn’t get rid of my back pain, it forced me to try high doses of cannabis, and that may be a viable cure (or at least a patch!) for my insomnia. I’m going to keep playing with ratios, amounts and timing. And I’m going to bust open the indica today, see if that makes a difference. It’s nice to have any level of hope again. I am in awe of the fact that I had a great short sleep and woke up with no brain fog. The potential that this could be a long term solution for me is just so exciting. I know there’s a lot of you here that struggle with sleeplessness, chronic pain, sleep meds don’t work, nothing fucking works... all the same bullshit that I struggle with, so maybe this will help one of you.
Signal	I can't stop crying. I've tried everything. I wake up the same time every day. I'm 13 and I'm getting like 4 hours a night and it's driving me insane I feel so out of everything and I look awful and I really don't know what to do anymore I can't think but I don't want it to affect my family and I'm trying to snap out of it but I just can't, I feel like I can't be bothered to do anything and my eyes are on fire. I'm sorry for venting but I feel like just giving up
Signal	In the life of being a full time student and having a part time job, at the age of 28, because of stress I started having sleep problems. Sometimes would struggle to sleep for two nights straight to the point where I took the suggestion from a family member to see a Psychiatric Urgent Care. When I spoke to the Psychiatrist I was not my usual self. I was very anxious and talking more than I normally do. She gave me Zyprexa (olazapine?) for sleep. At first, it was wonderful. I took 2.5 mg and slept for 10 hours straight waking up feeling great. Then I realized after about a week and a half, it wasn't working so I took 5.0 mg and sometimes 7.5. This lasted 3 and a half weeks until I realized it caused eating problems, anxiety throughout the day and serious sex problems that caused my girlfriend to break up with me. Keep in mind, I never in my life had sleep problems. In fact, I was able to sleep through anything, go on camping trips sleep on a yoga mat in a tent or on that thing that goes on trees, or take naps throughout the day. Yet, it has been a month since I have been off of this stuff since my family members and myself realized it was a bad idea and I still have restless leg, a tingling sensation and insomnia. If you only been on this stuff for a month, is it easy to get off of? I weaned off of it for like 3 days?? If anyone can help me on this matter that would be great. I don't think I have bi polar. No mania, or depression, etc. Any advice? OR even a response to this would be great. Thanks.
Signal	I hate it. I havent even started working. I work at kitchen (amigos chicken wings) for 4 hours a day and i assume if i pass ill get the job and then ill have to start 8h shifts 5 days a week. I hate already going for 4 hours, how on fucking earth ill survive 8h a day? Im depressed, social anxiety, i hate buses because there is so many people in and i just hate socializing in all general.The place i work is also quite busy and i just cant catch up. Most of the work i do and some clumsy guy while the other guy just watches over us doing nothing.. (he is leaving in few days, might be cuz of that).I never really worked. Ever since highschol i stayed at home doing nothing but playing games whole day. I cant even sleep. I slept like 4 hours maybe in past 3 days. Idk whats wrong with me. I think too much about how hard will it get once im 2nd shift (today...) because apparently they have so much job that they cant even take break.. It seems in this place is when there are no orders thats your break lol. There are 3 people in kitchen. I dont see why we cant rotate and let 1 go have 30 min break while others 2 work and so on. Just bullshit.When there are no orders, im hoping that nobody orders anything for at least 15-20 min so i can chill.Whats worse is because i have goal. I want to save money and get enough for a plane ticket to visit my boyfriend in UK and live with him one day and youd think having such big goal would make everything easier but not for me. I honestly dont know whats wrong with me. I just want to go sleep but im not allowed to for some reason. Please help someone. I ocassionaly thought about killing my self as well. Seems like easy route eh?
NotSignal	The 6 prescriptions I’m on haven’t been working so I’m back to fixing the basics, starting with making my sleeping environment more suitable. The earplugs I use have been hurting my ear drums causing throbbing during the day. Not to mention, they aren’t the best at canceling sound and I hear everything still, just slightly muffled. Does anyone have any earplugs they absolutely love that have helped them find sleep?
NotSignal	Right before you would like to go to bed just consume about a spoonful of honey.I’m not quite sure why this works and I haven’t looked into it, but I tried it out one night after seeing it somewhere and it worked quite well so I continued to try it and it’s been working pretty well. Good luck guys!
NotSignal	hard to concentrate, memory problem, in school i find it very hard to learn the concept and constantly forgetting it. I used to be very quick wit and clever in a way that I only need to show up in class listen to the lecture knows the concept and straight to exam with no problem. Now I am constantly anxious about this is going to be forever. Please can anyone give me some advice to recover. I wish this is not a permanent thing.
NotSignal	My limbs twitch and I get hypnic jerks constantly when I lay down in bed and try to relax. Even when I get out of bed because I can't sleep, I feel that same way when I go sit in a chair and try to relax. Just shaky and jerky. Hell, I can't even relax with my eyes closed on the floor without feeling like there's electricity in my veins.I feel wired all the time, and never sleepy, even on minimal/no sleep. Last night I tried to do sleep restriction and stimulus control but I really couldn't relax these symptoms to get sleep, despite all the slow stretching, deep breathing, and thought reframing that I do. Feels like I'm perpetually stuck in fight of flight in my body.Is it possible I am too hyper-aroused for CBTI to be effective right now? Or is it a matter of pushing through and possibly enduring nights without sleep until sleep drive shows up? I wish I knew how to turn this shit off.
Signal	Wanted to know if anyone feels the same as me. I'm 22. Since I was a kid, there are times I can't sleep and I cover myself to my nose to the point it gets difficult to breathe because I feel there is something dangerous in my room. Like something bad is about to happen and I have to protect myself some way. I know it's ridiculous but I can't help it.I lost entire nights of sleep because of this. I was exhausted but just couldn't sleep relaxed. Never had hallucinations or anything, just the fear and anxiety. Sometimes I also wake up in the middle of the night screaming or I suddenly get out of bed and start running in panic. I notice this because I'm like half conscious and half sleeping, and after a few seconds I realize I was in panic for no reason.
Signal	In July of 2019 I was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer which they call “duodenal cancer”A month later I went in for surgery to have the tumor removed and survived despite the 50/50 odds due to how major the surgery is.Since then I have been unable to sleep; literally. I close my eyes at night and can never drift off into a deep unconscious state. It’s like I’m on caffeine 24/7 and my brain forgot how to shut off.I am suffering greatly and have little interest in my external world. I feel so disconnected from reality and lay in bed most of the day unable to nap. I’m at the point where it feels like my body is shutting down and my family thinks that it’s just all in my head and I can just think positive to get out of this deep dark pit of despair, misery, agony, and absolute exhaustion. I feel like a zombie literally just going through the motions of existing and wonder when this will end.I used to sleep like a baby, never had depression, anxiety or insomnia but ever since my cancer diagnosis I haven’t been the same. It ruined my life:(
NotSignal	I did get 4 hours yesterday but I might as well not gotten any sleep at all with the way I feel. This shit fucking sucks. And everytime I contemplate just laying down in hopes of falling asleep my body just doesn't. Sounds dumb I know.
Signal	Every time I try going to bed, right as I’m falling asleep I get a terrifying feeling. You know when you are extremely tired while driving and that instant you start to doze off behind the wheel you jerk yourself awake and know you need to pull off? I get that exact feeling. Just to clarify, I don’t drive often where I am tired so it’s not a waking fear I have. I have suffered with insomnia as well as sleep paralysis. I can fall asleep easily when I’m supposed to, but I can never can stay asleep. I’m also a very light sleeper and any slight noise that happens wakes me up with a fearful feeling. I have seen my doctor about this and she wasn’t of any help. She said I may have narcolepsy based off of the fact that I’m always tired and take small naps (on my own accord) during the day due to being so tired all the time. I told her I’m always tired because I don’t get sleep at night. Her solution was to put me on sleeping pills and still suspected narcolepsy with no signs of it. I can’t take any sleep aids because they make my sleep paralysis kick in or I will “wake up” in the middle of the night, but not sure what’s going on or will hallucinate. The last time my doctor put me on sleeping pills, I “woke up” in the middle of the night, but I couldn’t tell if I was awake or sleeping. I started bawling because I didn’t know if it was reality or not. It was so bad my boyfriend at the time was freaked out and almost took me to the hospital until he soothed me to sleep by petting my hair.I believe the anxiety from falling and staying asleep results from being in some pretty crappy relationships where they would jerk off in bed while I’m asleep, text other women, leave to go meet up with someone, and whatever else that has to do with cheating. My current (soon-to-be ex) bf is a pretty terrible person where he did all of the above (diagnosed sociopath). So any time he slightly moves, I wake up in fear he is doing something. I truly believe at one point he was crushing up a sleeping aid and putting it in my cup of tea he would make me so he could get away with these things. I would have the same side effects only when he would make the tea vs me. One time when this happened and I woke up in the middle of the night half awake to him jerking off. He tried convincing me I was hallucinating and dreamt the whole thing. He always used my sleeping issues against me like that. I just don’t understand why it’s the impending doom of falling asleep behind the wheel. A couple of times I actually did think I was behind the wheel.It also doesn’t help that he has anxiety and will at times wake up at 4 in the morning to clean and vacuum after I finally had just fallen asleep, or keep the tv going all night every single night then get mad at me for getting mad at him to the point where he told me that I should wear headphones when I go to bed so I don’t keep “bitching” at him about it. Or responds with “well you should learn to sleep through it, I can so what’s your problem”.. you know, instead of hey I should probably not vacuum and let her sleep since she doesn’t do it often and the fact that it’s 4 in the goddamn morning. But that’s a whole ‘nother issue.
NotSignal	Second time I tried it. First time it was okay, but the dopey feeling stayed with me the entire next day. I only took half this time. Made me groggy, that's it. I was awake the entire night.
NotSignal	I've had about 8 hours sleep in the last 5 days, I feel really tired all the time but even if I go to bed I just lie there unable to sleep. If I do fall asleep I'm awake again within 2-3 hours and unable to fall back to sleep.
Signal	Couldn’t take anymore, had to get a prescription. I was prescribed amitripytyline. Had this stuff helped you guys out at all?
NotSignal	is this normal? does it go away after a while?
NotSignal	The pay is good. I thought at first it wasn't bad until a right now I cant go to sleep for the past 4 days. I usually successfully change my sleeping pattern but this week sucks.
NotSignal	I’ve started taking prazosin to sleep. I’m just wondering if it has helped anyone.
NotSignal	So I have always struggled to sleep, never what I'd call an insomniac, just struggled to drop back off if I woke. Usually from dreams.Then I found cannabis, amazing, I slept all night, no dreams, rested and happy in the morning.Now I have an 8 month old and for those with kids, you know you are going to have sleepless nights right but I am getting up to feed him or settle him back to sleep and I cannot drop back off.I'm currently at 3:41am. I went to bed at 9pm and had to get up at 11pm. That's it, two hours. Maybe that's way more than others but does anyone have any ideas how to drop off in between feeds of baby please?It's so frustrating and it starts to make me cry laying here listening to the baby sleep and knowing I'm gonna be so drained and grumpy tomorrow. I get up with awful headaches.Any techniques or tips welcome
Signal	Hey everyone, I've been having some serious sleep issues lately.I take enough medication/alcohol to kill someone without a tolerance and I still can't get any goddamn sleep. Usually I just take Remeron, but lately that hasn't been working. Taking Remeron and 2-3 benzos still isn't enough to get me to sleep anymore. So lately I've been mixing Remeron, benzos and drinking half a bottle of whiskey or whatever, and if I'm lucky I can actually fall asleep.It's 3am right now and this sucks. Can anyone relate?
NotSignal	3rd night of taking Xanax to sleep in the hospital. I’ve tried meditating the entire day and listening to meditation podcasts. Somehow it does not work. I gave up and called the nurse for Xanax. I’m stressed about having covid and being trapped in the hospital. I asked to speak to the doctor regarding this because it’s greatly affecting my ability to sleep. I feel so awake now but I haven’t slept at all. Help.. is It safe to continue taking Xanax for the rest of my hospital stay?
NotSignal	I’ve been staying up till like 2-4 plays games with friends and ruin my sleeping schedule. But Past 3 days i been sleeping at 9pm but wake up at midnight, but i was able to go back to sleep and wake up like 10 or 11. But today I didn’t fall asleep at all. And kinda feeling anxiety because i dont know what this means. Its 8am for me and not being able to sleep. Any advices on what i should do to actually sleep? I know not staying up late playing games is one of them but any other advices?
NotSignal	Just curious if others have experienced this. I had insomnia previous to the start of the quarantine, but ever since it started it seems to have gotten worse. Have any of you experienced this?
NotSignal	I just want to share my story here incase it can help anyone. Not sure how common this type of insomnia is, but i couldn’t find much when it first started happening to me. I did want to shout out to user/sleepanxiety for giving me a reading list that helped me get started on the path of healing - read his posts as well.\---One year ago, my life changed in a way I never thought possible. One year ago I could never have imagined that something I considered a detail in life would turn into a monster and nearly swallow me whole.*Sleep anxiety is a vicious loop of fear that keeps a person from needed rest.* When this first started to happen to me, I was so bad I couldn’t even close my eyes - my body would sense me relaxing and cause a panic attack. My stomach was so torn up from stress I would vomit or dry heave. After a couple weeks, I went to a mental ward after I completely broke down. How could it get so bad?**Months of stress**It all started in 2019 when one day out of the blue I couldn’t breathe and my chest hurt, and so I started exploring reasons - I started reading about acid reflux, and though i didn’t have all the symptoms of it, i felt like it was possible. After reading tons about it, i started getting all the symptoms, and got put on medication. At the same time i had been TTC, so I really didn’t want to be on medication, and felt alot of pressure to get off the meds. I kept a spreadsheet of my nasal (breathing issues) and acid reflux symptoms on an hourly basis to try and find patterns from something I might have been doing, or eating that was causing it. After months of recording data, and seeing all kinds of doctors without answers, I happened to take xanax one night and noticed my chest didn’t hurt for the first time when i woke up. My gastro doc told me that it could be stress manifesting itself in different ways. I decided to test this out by taking a small dose of the xanax for a week and see if the pain clears up. Sure enough it did: i quit the PPI pills and I was just fine - this was incredible! I could just stop taking the xanax and manage the stress on my own from here on out. ← this was the biggest mistake i could have made.I was only taking .5mg per night for a little over a week, so i thought it was safe to just stop taking it. The first nite I didn’t take it, i couldn’t fall asleep. This freaked me out, as it was probably the first nite of my life that i didn’t get a wink of sleep. But i figured it was just normal since I built up a tolerance to it in a short time. By the second night, I still couldn’t sleep at all, i felt a little bit tired but when i would start to approach the fringes of sleep, my body jolt me awake (hypnic jerk) - at this point i’m freaking out even more - in just 2 days, my body starts associating trying to sleep with panic. I had no idea what was happening to me, I just started researching insomnia and that made everything even worse. I tried taking more xanax which i had to take quite a bit more of, only to wake up the next day in a panic that i wouldn’t be able to sleep again this night. My mind quickly started to turn on me, thinking the worst of what would happen to me if i was stuck like this - i couldn’t focus on anything but sleep, i just wanted it. My work was piling up, I was afraid i would lose my job from not only the brain fog that fear creates, but pissing away the hours reading every forum, comment, pill review, anything to give my mood a boost that something i’m taking or want to try will help. All the stress was causing me constant nausea making it impossible to keep food down which was compounding everything.Was I dying of insomnia? which by the way isn’t “not getting a full night's sleep” - I’m talking about ZERO SLEEP - the one with waves of anxiety, alternating hot and cold sweats, heart racing, obsessive thoughts flying, hallucinating, just giving anything for even one hour of sweet relief, but instead sore all over from laying so long, watching the room get shades brighter each hour until it’s time to get up and be with normal people: yawning from completing their sleep cycles. My face pale, and my heart full of tears cuz i can’t cry anymore.**Mental help**After two weeks of this, combing the internet for solutions, taking pills that work only temporarily, i gave in and went to the ER. I told them how i’d been suffering and spending too much time fantasising about death, the ultimate escape.I thought i could only go up from here.. But when they put me in the mental ward where people were either screaming or zombified, I thought i was only adding PTSD into my mix. I saw the psychiatrist that night, and he gave me zyprexa which cleaned me up real quick. I remember taking it, going to sleep, waking up 12 hours later and having the pleasurable feeling of hunger for the first time. I was still scared that this was another one time fix, and it wouldn’t keep working for me but it did! That same week I was back to work like nothing even happened. I was so filled with joy and just bliss that this pill was magic. I didn’t want to research it in case it had bad side effects down the road that would just stress me and snowball again.It had been two months, the holidays were here and despite gaining about 20 pounds, I was feeling better than great. I had tapered all the way down from zyprexa with my doctor, and was about to leave town for christmas. I didn’t take any pills with me because I thought i was back to normal, but that first night away, i had felt slight stress from traveling, and as soon as my head hit the pillow BAM! It all came racing back, panic attacks, hot/cold… everything hit me again. I was not only devastated because I thought I was cured, but I was miles from home and would have to wait a few days to get a new prescription. So i again went almost 96 hours without a wink of sleep - in a place i was supposed to be at least okay and not ruin a holiday which was basically impossible, all i could do was lay down stare at the ceiling and wish my life away.Since I didn’t read about zyprexa being an antipsychotic, I didn’t know about all the side effects that comes with those which include hyperprolactinemia and movement disorders. The former causing anovulation which is a death sentence for someone TTC. And the latter a scary condition where the muscles in your face convulse randomly after taking this class of drugs long (or sometimes short) term. I got the script and started taking it again but this time weary about what would happen if i didn’t get off of it at some point - just never get to have children, or worse have permanent issues i described up there. The months rolled on, and I kept trying to get off it but everytime i was a few days off, the fear and panic slammed me again. Without zyprexa, at night, i would generally have thoughts about not getting sleep, and those would escalate into a panic attack, and thats how the whole cycle would start. Sometimes my thoughts would start earlier in the day, and just simmer until nighttime would tend to be worse. And other times I would get fixated on other thoughts, just random terrible things to sabotage myself.**Facing the monster**I knew i had to try to face that fear or else i’d have to live with too many regrets. So when the pandemic hit in march, and I found myself working from home - it would be a good opportunity to experiment with coming off my meds again but this time, try some new tactics. So i again tapered off zyprexa, and by this time my psych had me on a high dose of zoloft, gabapentin, propranolol, and trazadone. I also got serious about getting a regular meditation practice started. This was the first turning point for me. During the day I learned the theory of meditation, and at night, i applied it to sleep. *Reading list (suggested by /user/sleepanxiety thank you so much) and started Sam harris’ Waking up course … it was mind boggling**Books-** *The sleep book - Guy meadows** *10% happier - Dan Harris** *Meditation for fidgety skeptics - Dan harris**Meditation apps-** *Waking up - Sam harris** *10% Happier - Dan harris*In bed, I would start meditating (at first just counting breaths) and it would keep my mind occupied enough to fall asleep. It was the beginning of May, I had been off zyprexa for 2 weeks which is longer than I ever went before, and as I got better at meditating, I was starting to fall asleep faster and i wasn’t having panic attacks! I didn’t know if it was the pills or the meditation, but after about a month, i had my next breakthrough: *the point of meditation isn’t to push out thoughts, it’s to embrace them*. As soon as I started my night meditation with the premise of “any thought i have is welcome”, it instantly took the pressure off - and i would sort of filter all of my thoughts that came next into somewhat of a game.There are two kinds of thoughts:1. naturally occurring thoughts2. forced thoughtsNaturally occurring thoughts are the ones that come by themselves. Seemingly random. Forced thoughts are the ones that you “try not to think” like the bad ones i would concoct during the day that would feast on me at night.So my game would be: Let’s do breath meditation waiting for a natural thought. If a forced thought comes thru, just let it sit in the background, go back to the breath until a natural thought comes. And be curious as to what your mind comes up with! This is actually pretty tricky to do because you don’t realize when your mind wanders to a thought, because it’s wandering. So it’s the magic moment meditators talk about.. The moment you realize you’re swept up in a thought, and you bring yourself back to your anchor, which in this case is the breath. If you do this and it doesn’t work, just keep practicing! You get better at this ...This game was incredibly effective for me. I would go until i got 2 natural thoughts, then 3, then 4. and they were always so wacky. I was like a machine while i was meditating - my breath was clean and dependable. I almost never had forced thoughts again- and if i did i had a place waiting for them, a little slot where i could account for everything that could come at me. Another big breakthrough was physical expression - I was starting to become inthralld with the feeling of breathing to where just tuning into my diaphragm relaxing during an exhale gives off a sense of almost euphoria. It was so relaxing i could just start meditating to the feeling of my breath while doing just about anything and almost fall asleep! **How to be awake**I had to keep my mind occupied or it would fall back on fear and just spiral downward. I threw myself into work, which before this all happened was the passion of my life. Before my depression hit, i enjoyed waking up and going to work. So trying to get that back was slow but sure. I just blasted through projects and not long after, I was back to designing in my spare time too, and by 7/8pm i’d eat dinner, sit on the couch with my head buzzing from a full day of productivity good-tired and ready for sleep. By mid-pandemic when our company was taking pay cuts, i actually got a raise! I weaned down off of everything and went 3 months without a panic episode. But i knew i was not cured. I would have to see how i’d react to one in order to assess my progress. And it was about to come..In July, randomly one night going to sleep i had a small jolt, and my body just slammed me with an adrenaline rush which gave me a wave of nausea and hot and cold flashes again, it stirred up some old familiar feelings so i was startled, and of course scared again. I tried to apply the meditation techniques i’d been preparing for when this happens, and try to use the bodily sensations i was experiencing as my object of meditation and get curious about them, instead of fearful. I had a couple smaller waves of fear, but then i was able to get to sleep. I woke up amazed that for the first time, I was getting closer to the monster, I was getting through it.**Now**It’s currently the end of august, i planned a trip with my man, I really wanted to test how i’d do under pressure - and the first nite was not great, and i was a little bit down about it, but the next night and each after was fine, and ended up enjoying the rest of my trip, getting good sleep with a full appetite.To say i’m a new person is an understatement, I practice meditation every day, for about one hour. I do a hard stop work at 4pm, and no matter how crazy of a day, i let it all go and sit for an hour. I use the stress level i’m at when i go into the meditation as a test to see how fast i can put it down and just let my mind rest. It’s training for if my emotions get out of control at night, so i can do the same - watch my thoughts come and go, filing each away in their place.If you are suffering, please know that it does get better, with time and some insight. Experiment with the things you learn about your mind, and you will find something that works for you. Please post here or message me and i’ll go into detail about anything in my story.TLDR; Developed sleep anxiety induced insomnia which caused me to break all the way down until i learned the power of meditation is to be okay with any thoughts you have, and that they don’t have to control you.
Signal	It's 7 in the morning and still haven't fallen asleep. I had extreme fatigue yesterday afternoon. Where did it go? I have shit to do.
NotSignal	As the title says, my mind just keeps buzzing and I am really clueless what to do. I already meditate and do other activities that are supposed to clear my mind, but they don't seem to work for me. Can anyone relate? Do you know what could be a solution to this issue? Before bedtime I do a brain dump and albeit this works slightly, my mind just doesn't shut down argh.
NotSignal	Does anyone have issues where they gain alertness in the morning or some point throughout the night and can’t recognize if they were awake the whole time or asleep?
NotSignal	We all have insomnia. The five of us were discussing when we went to sleep the night before. One if us passed out at 5am, one 4am, me and another didn’t sleep at all then one went at 2am and started bragging about how healthy he is haha
NotSignal	Before I go to bed, every single night, I get really bad anxiety attacks. Usually it’s an intense fear of dying, and not being conscious. Like, I’ll start imagining what it’s like to be dead, and not feel anything. I’ll look at light and think about how one day I won’t be able to see it. Or how one day I’m gonna lose everyone. Usually my heart starts racing like crazy, my vision goes white, my body goes numb, and I feel like i’m i’m a dream/already dead.It’s gotten to the point where they’re so bad I can’t sleep & I’ve actively been afraid of going to bed because I don’t wanna experience it again. I havent had a night without an anxiety attack for so long I can’t remember.Am I the only one who has to deal with this?
Signal	As an adult looking back I'm pretty horrified that I was prescribed Ambien when I was 18 and was continued to be given a prescription for 15 years after that. Every night for all those years. Now that I am aware of the potential dangers of long term use I decided to ween myself and then completely go off of it on my own. I figured quarantine would be a great opportunity to do this without it effecting my work as much. I am on week two of not taking it at all and it is still really rough. I expected the rebound insomnia but the anxiety is ridiculous. I've spent a lot of time reading about people coming off Ambien but I can find barely anything about anyone who was talking it for as long as I did. Any experiences or information about long term Ambien use would be VERY appreciated. Thank you!
NotSignal	My sleeping schedule has been bad for years. I haven't really slept before 3AM since I was 13, and it's very unstable in general. A few months back I started sleeping in the morning after sunrise. I tried my best not to but it did not work. I am worried this will soon get worse (if that's even possible). What am I supposed to do? Thanks for your time
Signal	I barely got any hours of sleep last night like around 4 hours. Im kind of concerned since my sleep schedule has been shrinking ever since I was in middle school. In elementary school, I still had trouble falling asleep. Whenever, I cant fall asleep I get even more stressed which then leads to even less sleep. I want to find a way so that I wont get restless nights ever again. Another thing I noticed was that ever since high school, I always feel waves of drowsiness rather than fresh new "kid" energy for some odd reason that I cant explain. Thank you to everyone who has had helped me or will help me.
Signal	Long story short: I had some of the worst anxiety ever and couldn't sleep. The doctor prescribed me 50 mg of Zoloft, which is too much and took only 25 mg. Cured my insomnia.Recently I started smoking weed and now I am at day 33 of no THC. First few weeks I couldn't sleep more than 3-4 hours. Now I barely sleep 5 hours. Thinking of taking Zoloft just to sleep more.
Signal	I started taking it nightly (at the reccommended dosage) and it knocks me tf out. It's magical. I'm however (slightly) worried about this fucking me up even more. But it's better than popping one of my expired xanax to go to sleep- I can actually wake up after! Well kind of. But xanax will make me snooze all my alarms and miss work.A little context: I have insomnia, chronic fatigue, and chronic pain. I have CPTSD, GAD, and SAD. My pychiatrist gave me Vistaril but it didn't help with sleep or anxiety even when I tried doubling the dose. I take venlafaxine ER nightly with magnesium and tumeric ginger. I did a lot of drugs in college, but I've been green sober for 5 years.
Signal	So I've been on an inverted sleeping schedule for a while now, going to sleep around 5am and waking up at 3pm and it's been going fine but now a flight has ruined it. I missed my window when I was super sleepy at 10am. It is now 11pm, I've been up for 29h, barely feel sleepy, my neighbours are being loud and I have anxiety about losing control while falling asleep. What can I do?
NotSignal	Wish me luck its 9:27 pm right now and I am going to bed at 10 pm wish me good luck. I'm currently anxious right now
NotSignal	Fuck my brain, when I'm trying to sleep it wouldn't fucking shut up, I just want to sleep, I haven't slept for four days and I feel like I'm loosing it. ALL I WANT IS SLEEP
NotSignal	Since late December I had problems with sleeping but finally I fixed it, I was going to take medication but my fathe told me to do this first and I took some days: He told me to stay awake no matter what until I felt very tired in the night, do some exercise three hours before going to bed, do some meditations too. I only slept 2-3 hours at first but then I started to sleep fast doing meditation between 11 pm-12 am and now finally my insomnia is over.This worked for me.
Signal	i’m 15, and i haven’t slept a nights sleep in months. my anxiety attacks have become so bad that i literally cant sleep at all anymore. it constantly feels like i’m having a heart attack because of how fast my heart beats. i cant even speak and breathing becomes difficult. it’ll start around 11:30-12, and it’ll last until around 6:00 in the morning—at least. mentally, i’ve been exhausted for years, really (it started around age 11, probably. at most, age 12). physically, my body just refuses sleep.
NotSignal	Well I’m not the best at making reddit posts and this is my first time on this subreddit. I say my insomnia got worse because I haven’t slept at all today it is currently 9:25 A.M. The last few days have been bad on the 29th I slept at 11AM, 30th (Yesterday) I slept at 8AM, and Today which is the 31st I haven’t slept. I tend to have anxiety which lasts for about 2-3 days which comes with nights of no sleeping. I was worrying about SFI, while looking on this subreddit you guys probably know about this so I don’t wanna trigger anybody to get thoughts or flashbacks. Then stumbling across this subreddit I saw a brilliant post about how SFI and how if “you think you have it, you dont” I’m paraphrasing it but yeah my insomnia got worse. Yes I’ve been sleeping but its like I have a fear of sleeping which really sucks because I love sleep, I mean everybody loves it. Before all of this I’d stay up late but it is nothing like is going on and I need help on this should I just stay up the rest of the day because school starts in 3 days although it’s online I dont wanna miss any of my classes. I really have bad anxiety so this may be attributing to my sleepless nights. Anyways if anybody on here sees this I hope you are having a good day !
NotSignal	I think I have a lifestyle that allows me to sleep well but i have insomnia regardless. I exercise daily, eat really healthy, have social life, etc. I think using electronics before bed is causing me to not sleep some nights. Anyways, I can’t just not use electronics. I’ll just be bored or not know what to do. I use my iPad to draw and I like YouTube for my history videos. I also like to try to fix my computer at night when I have free time. Has anyone been able to leave electronics before bed and if so what did you replace that free time with? I need something to do otherwise I won’t be tired. Thanks!
NotSignal	Most people think insomnia is only about trouble falling asleep, but I have the opposite problem. I have no trouble feeling sleepy and falling asleep, I just can't sleep enough. I typically get 4-5 hours of sleep per night, sometimes less. I fall asleep quickly, but wake up in the night and can't fall asleep again.Does anyone else experience this? If so, do you know why and what are you doing to prevent it?
NotSignal	I've had enough of staying up all night and hearing birds starting to chirp. I love the sunrise and early mornings more than any other time of day, but I just want to sleep. At night. I'm not a night owl anymore. I used to prefer nighttime but now it's just depressing and dark (no pun intended) for me.My family gets upset because I wake them up at night because I'm not good at being quiet, even if I'm trying to be. Another reason why I want to sleep 9-6I've been sleeping so little at night lately and taking depressing naps during the day. I hate this. I just want a full night's sleep. I'll go to bed at 9 pm, I'll do it every day. I'm willing. I'll lay in bed for a few hours, even, for the first few nights, if it means it'll become stable.I took a shower and I'm glad I finished it, but I felt like passing out a few times while in there.I'm so tired it's hard to enjoy myself, but it's 2pm. 20 minute power naps aren't nice for me so I can't do that ): I wish I didn't have to take naps, ever again. Daytime naps are nice but I'd rather spend that time playing video games or drawing I thought yesterday I was going to sleep well for once, but my cat woke me up after 7 hours, at 2am. I went to bed at 7pm in hopes I'd get to sleep through most of the night but still experience the sunrise. She woke me up the day before that as well. I hope it won't happen again.What sucks is I can't get medicine and I can't get help because 1. no money 2. the quarantine 3. I'm starting to think this country is a bureaucracy (Finland)I have weekly therapy sessions for trauma but it feels like the next appointment is so far.aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Signal	i feel like im in hell. ill fall asleep then wake up half an hour later and just continue this cycle all night until I give up. i have classes in the morning and my participation grade is going down the fucking drain
NotSignal	It is almost 4 am. I cannot sleep. I keep getting distracted by sub Reddit’s. my eyes are burning but yet I prevail. my self destructive tendencies will always be the most powerful. I wish I had some weed.
NotSignal	Haven't had more that 4 hours/night in the last 3 weeks. Most nights have been 1-2 hours. Anybody up? Bored, tired, frustrated...
NotSignal	To clarify, it’s kind of funny, but I feel bad. I don’t even know I’m doing it. Anytime I spend the night, I inevitably wake up, yell “Ahhhhhhh!” and his name. He wakes up, asks me what’s wrong, but I immediately go back to sleep. I don’t always remember it happening. I have pretty bad insomnia. I don’t sleep through the night very often and I have early morning wakefulness. Sometimes I don’t go to sleep until 3 or 4 in the morning. My roommates say I also do weird things like this at home, too. My question is, what is this, and how can I stop it?
Signal	i have not been diagnosed professionally but i tell my parents i wanna go to the doctor but they don’t believe me. i have had this for about 3 months now and i have gotten 10 hours of sleep a week at the most. but i feel really shitty and tired but can’t fall asleep i’ve been taking 4 melatonin pills that are 7 grams but they’ve only gave me at least 1 more hour of sleep at the most and i get these vivid nightmares that are TERRIBLE.Are any of you diagnosed people having these symptoms i just wanna sleep.Thanks in advance
Signal	After enduring insomnia for my whole life, I recently had a doctor finally diagnose me properly. The recommendations were typical (sleep hygiene, melatonin etc.), but since working from home due to Covid, it's come back with a vengance. I forced myself to get back to running, even if for 5-10 mins, and I'm starting to realize the lasting effects of it. Even though it hasn't solved the problem, when I'm sitting in bed trying to sleep, the general level on anxiety is much lower. If you're interested, I recommend checking out Salomon's trail running channel on youtube. You'd be surprised by how many ultra runners have the same struggles. Would love to hear your thoughts
NotSignal	Hey, as in the title said, I often have uncontrollable thoughts while I’m laying down and trying to sleep.Like my thoughts and imaginary pictures just rushing through my mind and coming really out of nowhere. I have that like almost every second night right now where my mind won’t stop being active.I hope it’s understandable what I mean. And has anyone else made the same you experiences as me and give me some advices or share their experience with me.
NotSignal	My sleeping pattern was never ideal but at least I got sleep. The combination of being stuck in a room that is 17 square metres + not being able to see my family or have any physical contact + thesis in a week makes that I just can't sleep. I decide to have an all nighter, at 8 am my body gets too heavy and I feel nauseous so I decide to sleep until 14pm and tje cyclus repeats itself for two weeks now. I am currently crying because I just don't know what to do.
Signal	I experienced severe insomnia and depression all at once. The doctors don't believe me but I am dying. I'm only 21 and have gone through most of the stages of psychogenetic death...it is brutal and it isn't a choice, in my humble opinion. However, when a loved one is experiencing this (pure apathy, withdrawing from people and social activities, lack of self care, not showering)....please do whatever it takes to help them. I'd like to note, I have the best support system in the world anyone could ask for..but i sincerely believed I deserved to die, went off meds, and did nothing for 3 months. It confuses me because i have an amazing boyfriend and a supportive family. But i still wanted to die because i hated myself and refused treatment because of my stupid ego and fear of failure. So heed my advice. Don't give up on life. I don't care how hard it is. Also, keep yourself busy as much as you can. Baby steps are important. It's rare to get rid of depression and insomnia in just a day. TL; DR : psychogentic death is real. It is giving up on life. Im going through it and I am only 21. Doctors don't believe I am dying ._.
Signal	I’m confused which one I might have. I find it very hard to fall asleep at night but I’ll still be tired. I get very tired during the day and god forbid you put me in the car I’ll be out like a light. I can sleep period of only 4 hours a night to over 12 hours of sleep. Honestly very confused. I’ve fallen asleep in a toilet before at school and I’ve also nearly fallen asleep multiple times before in class sometimes. But it’s strange because I’ll get really cold and like I can’t move and my eyelids start to close and it’s super hard to control any of my actions. That can happen days in a row or not happen for weeks as well.
Signal	Okay, so, for the past who knows how long, I've had a lot of trouble with sleep. Almost every night, I'll just lie there in pitch blackness for hours until the sun comes up, and then I get confused because it's hard to tell whether or not I got even a minute of sleep. For some context, I am a healthy female teenager. I don't have any other medical problems (none that are diagnosed anyway). However, when I do get to sleep fairly quickly (in comparison, anyway, around 11pm on a great day, and anywhere past 1:30am usually), I always, *always*, wake up a few times a night, the first time is anywhere between 1:30 - 3am, then again, a second time at around 4 - 4:30am. Twice, sometimes even three times a night, as it's been for the past four or five days in a row. I get off my electronics at *least* an hour before bed and take melatonin pills prescribed by a doctor, but I've only had them for a few days. I can't sleep in silence, so I play white noise, have the fan on, or play thunderstorm sounds, none of which are loud enough to wake me up during the night. I also have very vivid dreams and nightmares pretty often.Does anyone have any tips that could help?
NotSignal	Does anyone who struggles with sleep deprivation/ insomnia have issues with seizures due to lack of sleep? Or anyone who has insomnia care to let me know if you have had a seizure or not ? Interested to hear peoples experiences and wondering if everyone who’s lacking sleep gets seizures or not ??
NotSignal	Some nights are good and some nights are really bad. Tonight was really bad. It's 8:30 now and I haven't slept. Through the night my spirit was kind of okay, at some point I did some reading. But now the reality just hits me again. Another night without sleep. I know it will affect this day and the day after. How the hell can I live like this? How the hell can I function?I really don't know anymore.
NotSignal	Hi guys. Sorry for the mobile formatting.I’m an athlete and I deal with a bit of bedtime resistance normally, but 2-3 sleeping pills usually will eventually put me to sleep. Yesterday I drank 200mg of caffeine at 9 am and couldn’t sleep at ALL last night. I wound up taking around **ten pills.** Nothing happened. I’ve never felt so helpless in my life with sleep. I felt hot, shaky, sweaty, and very very wide awake. I used to tolerate caffeine fine, but I’m wondering if I suddenly developed a sensitivity to it and if it’s the reason I couldn’t sleep.
NotSignal	So basically for the last two weeks I was watching Netflix until like 2-4am almost every night but I was always sleeping fine. Now in the last 39 hours I’ve slept for 3 hrs this afternoon, now it’s 3:47 am and I can’t sleep, my mind is racing and I feel like I’m going insane. Any advices from fellow redditors? Am I gonna be fine?
Signal	As an insomniac myself, I’ve struggled a lot from sleep disorders, which really affect my daily life as well as mental health. I‘ve tried meditation, taking melatonin, changing my sleep environment... you name it, yet nothing really seemed to work for me, I’m still constantly feeling stressed and sleep-deprived…Recently I discovered Braindex on IndieGoGo and it really caught my eye, it helps enhance your health both mentally and physically. Those who also suffer from sleep disorders can take a look:)Anyways, I’m ready to get my hands on Braindex, hopefully it will improve my sleep quality for the better.
NotSignal	I've had maybe 10 hours of sleep over the last two days. And I got that feeling in my stomach, that weird uneasy feeling. It's a nervous, nauseous feeling. I feel worn out, but also energetic enough to have a hard time sleeping. So I still have to take my sleep aid.Does this happen to anyone else?.
NotSignal	I have given up on trying to sleep. It's 6am, I wouldn't get much anyway so now I'm committed to watching the sun rise.
Signal	Lately life hasn't been so kind to me. I live with my very, very toxic parents. Usually my mother says really horrible things to me, and I can sometimes bear but other times I can't, so I end up crying and when that happens, I can't sleep? The same happens when I have anxiety, too. But I just don't understand why crying causes me to be unable to sleep? And I feel really helpless because crying isn't something that's within my control. I don't like how it contributes to my insomnia as well as my anxiety.
NotSignal	I know that it's a condition that keeps one from sleeping. My question is why and how does the body continue to stay awake, does it reject sleep when it is time to go to bed? Or is it just a "fuck you" from the brain to torture the human that owns it?
Signal	So I've got a six week long log of my sleep, and my sleep is not improving AT ALL. I still wake up after about 3-5 hours of sleep and struggle to go back to sleep (usually fail at getting back to sleep unless I've taken clonopin before bed). Most days I get less than 5.5 hours of sleep, which is supposed to be the bare minimum. Now there are a couple of things that I don't do: for instance I don't get up when I wake up at night. I tried it a few times, and getting out of bed just wakes me up. I also don't get out of bed right away when the alarm rings. Even when I'm awake, it's just I'm too drained to face the day. I might take 30 minutes to get out of bed....even with my reluctance to get out of bed, my sleep efficiency is between 80%-90%. I just can't keep up with this rigid schedule if I don't see any improvements. I've tried googling reasons for why sleep restriction might not work, but every search results says how great and effective a therapy it is, whereas I feel like I'm going to kill myself
NotSignal	Only online though. I have a huge community on my tail and I need to get out. Please help with ideas
Signal	So I have sleep problems for a long a time (I went to doctor last year and she sent me to clinical psyhologist and the first meeting was supposed to be in May-now later due to corona), I could not fall asleep for hours.Then I took melatonin for a month or two (I was kinda sad and when I took it) so now I can usually fall asleep relatively easily, however I wake up in the middle of the night and can not sleep again (not even in the morning as I used to when I was teen). What should I do?
Signal	2 days ago I only got one hour of sleep, last night I slept for about 6 hours and I was exhausted all day today.Tonight I played white noise from my phone thru my speakers to help me sleep and I was able to fall asleep by 11, then at 11:45 the white noise stopped and I woke up. Someone called me & my phone was on silent but just the fact that it stopped playing was enough to wake me up..I’ve been up since then and have to be up for work at 8. Then I have to write a research paper afterwards when I get home. I wish I could just pass out this is awful
NotSignal	technically it wasnt a full all nighter since i fell asleep at 9 am and woke up at 2 pm but im so fucking tired yet i cant sleep its like i forgot how to sleep
NotSignal	I try to sleep at 1 am but just can’t go to sleep until like 4 or 5. I have class at 8 everyday but I still can’t sleep on time no matter how hard I try. What do I do?
Signal	Yesterday it was nice out so I took my dogs on 3 walks (usually I take the for 4 or 5 but it started to rain later) in the sun, about an hour per walk. I ran 4 miles, did more exercises, then to really fatigue myself I made my mom go on a 2 hour walk in the sun with me. I was pretty tired. My plan was to stay up until 10 and then take an ambien so when I got 6 hours of sleep, it would be at a normal time. But I had been up since 1 am and I was bored out of my mind in the evening. So I said fuck it, I took half an ambien at 730 since I was exhausted, I didn't need much help. I knew my dogs were going to wake me up when the storm was over because understandably, they refuse to poop in the pouring rain and thunder. I wouldn't either so about 10 30 I got up to let them out, and normally that would be it, I would just be up, but I knocked right back out. I then woke up around 2, which had been 6 hours and honestly I'm fine with 6 hours of sleep. But I didn't want to keep getting up at 2, so I got out of bed, took the other half of my ambien, sat on the couch petting my dogs for about a half hour then went back to bed, as opposed to the previous night where I just laid there not sleeping. (Getting out of bed works).The next time I woke up was at 530 to feed the pups, and then I went back to bed until 7. It was unheard of.Tonight I'm planning on going to bed at 10:30 so that the initial 6 hours of sleep is at a normal time and not 2 amWe'll see!
NotSignal	Hey all!I’m going to use the remainder of quarantine to figure out some new sleep tactics, has anyone made tea with hops with any success?I’ve read that hops can help. Is there hope for hops? Lol
Signal	Hi, I'm not sure how to describe a specific type of insomnia that's happening to me in any way besides Hypnagogic thought processes.I've always been a light sleeper, and I've always had a light form of insomnia, with it taking me somewhere between a half hour and an hour to fall asleep, almost without exception, completely regardless of how tired I am. However, occasionally, somewhere between every few weeks and every few months, I experience bizarre cyclical thought patterns as I try to fall asleep, which keep me on the border of being awake and asleep, usually pertaining to whatever I had been thinking about earlier in the day or shortly before going to sleep, and often having to do with sleep itself.For example, recently I've been learning about machine learning, and last night I spent hours aware that I was physically in my bed, but convinced that I'd only truly be able to fall asleep if I solved certain (completely fake) equations. Or a few years ago, I had spent the day watching Fuller House with some friends, and I was essentially half-dreaming about Full House as I was aware that I was lying awake in my bed, once again convinced I could fully fall asleep if only I were to think about Full House in certain ways or something. Obviously these thought patterns are absurd.I don't experience hallucinations or delusions in other parts of my life, but I am one to overthink things on a general level. I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences, and if they've found any strategies for dealing with it. This doesn't affect me frequently, but I'd still like to manage it if possible.
Signal	I've had this problem for about a year over the course of several different jobs, so I don't think it's job specific. I've tried cutting caffeine, reading before bed, sleep meditation, sleepy time tea, melatonin, exercise, even NyQuil and Tylenol PM and I still can't "turn off" when I go to bed. My work is physically demanding, but even after hiking in rugged terrain for 10 hours, I'm lucky to get 1 hour of sleep before doing it again the next day. Twice now I've gone 3 days with basically 0 sleep. Please help me.
Signal	Hello all, I am going to detail here my journey to recovery from insomnia (to keep myself accountable but also to hopefully show some people who have given up that recovery is possible no matter the severity and duration of your insomnia). Some background info on me- I have had severe chronic insomnia for the past 11 years. During my teens I would sleep between 2-3 hours per night and would sometimes go for a couple of days without sleeping at all. Nowadays, I sleep every night for around 3.5 hours total. Very rarely I might get 1-2 hours. I have tried many herbal remedies, stimulus control therapy, certain methods from CBT-I (but never all at once- which is what I plan to do now), exercise, meditation, sleeping pills, mirtazapine, olanzapine, and other methods. None have worked so far. This time, I plan to use every technique from CBT-I for a period of 12 months. The longest I have attempted CBT-I was for 3 months, to no avail. I shall also be incorporating exercise, meditation, and good nutrition into my recovery regime. I shall be eating one kiwi fruit, one glass of tart cherry juice, one handful of almonds, and a whole-wheat cracker with nut butter 1-2 hours before bed, as the evidence shows these foods improve sleep by boosting melatonin, tryptophan, and serotonin- all important factors for sleep. I am currently on day 7 of sleep restriction therapy- my sleep window is 5 hours and 45 minutes. As my sleep diary for the past week shows, I have only been sleeping for 3.5 hours of this time. Therefore, as of tomorrow, I will be reducing my sleep window to 5 hours per night, the minimum recommended sleep window. Therefore, my bedtime will be 12:15 and wake up time will be 5:15. So far, on day 7 of sleep restriction therapy, my sleep drive before bed is quite strong. I struggle to stay awake for the last hour. I have been falling asleep in under 40 minutes which for me is huge. I still wake up after about 90 minutes and am awake for a while but I am sleeping about the same lying in bed for 5.5 hours as I would when I lay in bed for 9 hours so I have much more time in my day. One aspect of CBT-I I have not been doing is getting up out of bed if I haven't been sleeping for more than 20 minutes. I am typically too tired at night to bother doing this. I feel like if I am going to give recovery my all, however, I have to use this technique. Hopefully tomorrow night I will start doing this. However, for now, my main focus is to summon the willpower to get out of bed at 5:15am. I feel reasonably good today- even though I am tired I am awake and in a good mood. Anyway, I hope this thread can provide hope for people in 12 months time from now and can keep me accountable in the mean time. All the best.
NotSignal	I have been going to bed around 10/11pm and every night for the past month I wake up around 3:15-5:30am. I'm going crazy. What things are you guys doing with your docs to improve your sleep?
Signal	I have been tired the past 2 nights, and quite worried about it. about 3 nights ago I could go to sleep (using melatonin) with a good amount of sound without much of a problem, then the next night I just couldn't fall asleep. I ended up going to sleep at 4 am. the next night with enough willpower I got to sleep around 1:50, but woke up around 5:50 (I did get an extra hour in the afternoon). This has been worrying me for what will come for the next few weeks. Thank you for listening and if anyone has experienced something similar, please tell me how it ended up and what I can do.
NotSignal	I just wanted to vent since no one in this house is awake. I’m really really frustrated
NotSignal	Every time I have an all nighter and go to school I feel like my personality is just 10 times better vs when I’m at home I’m just fucking pissed at everything.
Signal	One of my favorite things to do when I can’t sleep is to watch the movie The Martian. For me the worst part of insomnia is the loneliness that I feel in the middle of the night when it feels like you’re the only person in the world that’s awake. So, I watch the Martian because Matt Damon’s character is alone and stranded on Mars and I think to myself, well at least I’m not alone on a different planet... plus it’s just a (mostly) lighthearted movie and is fairly long so it takes up a good chunk of the night. Or maybe insomnia has just made me completely insane for taking refuge in this idk lol
Signal	It's been getting worse lately, although I've had this problem my entire life. Tried everything - cutting out caffeine, cutting out sugar, not using devices before bed, dimming the lights, deep breathing, sleep meditation videos - you name it I've tried it. NOTHING works. I recently got prescribed melatonin and started on it yesterday. It worked well yesterday but right now it isn't working and I'm just frustrated. Idk what else to do at this point. I'm gonna miss classes because of this. I didn't pay 30k a year and spend $300 on an air ticket to come all the way to uni to MISS CLASSES. Fuck I'm panicking now
Signal	I don't consistently have sleep issues, sometimes for a period of time my sleep habits are pretty alright, but it's starting to become more rare. I don't do a lot after a night of little sleep, I get a couple coffees throughout the day which helps a little bit. Any additional tips for when the damage is done and you don't want to behave like a zombie the next day? I'll get through the day fine, but I don't want to treat people i meet during the day badly or seem distant bc of sleep issues.
Signal	So i find myself unable to sleep for 4 months now, simply because it started with 2-3 all nighters, then i couldnt stop thinking about sleep. it induced anxiety and alot of stress to my life about not being able to sleep normally again. Now whenever i dont think about it i find myself falling asleep, but its really really hard to not think about it because it has been going on for 4 months now.. Listening to podcasts wont help because i cant fall asleep on them, does anybody else have a ritual or something on how to turn your mind away from sleeping thoughts? .\_.Im really desperate even tho its "just" 4 months now, the echaustion from this is unreal.
Signal	So melatonin has NOT been working on me for months now, so I finally did some research and bought some sleep vitamins. The reason I can't sleep is due to a fear of losing consciousness and I don't even know why I have this fear. Melatonin hasn't worked because it doesn't stop my mind from being scared of resting. Alot of reviews online about SUKU said that it helped cure insomnia and helped "relax the mind", which I thought was EXACTLY what I needed. BUT IT DIDN'T WORK ON ME. my mind is very much NOT RELAXED. pls help idk what to do.. is there a better thing out there to help me start sleeping?
NotSignal	I kind of have a weird a problem. For 10 years, I have slept in a room without air conditioning. In the climate I lived it, it was never too cold for heating and during the summer I'd only occasionally open my window if it got too hot. I'm very used to sleeping in a warm environment without fans or air conditioning.Right now I have moved into a new apartment with a group of people, and the air conditioning runs throughout the top floor at night. The temperature is set at a reasonable house temperature (72 F), though at night I find it very challenging to sleep because I'm not used to sleeping in cooler temperatures and am especially not used to the cold air flow. Prior to moving here, I would be able to sleep in air conditioned rooms when traveling, but it would require a lot of effort and I wouldn't naturally fall asleep.The constant movement of cold air on me keeps me up at night. My body can feel comfortable in blankets, but my head constantly feels awake. I feel the cold air moving down my face and it feels like water. I can't shake this feeling of being awake all the time. It also really irritates my nose, making me feel constantly congested and waking up with a dry mouth (I've been trying to hydrate more to prevent this). I can sometimes get to sleep wearing a mask, but it can be very distracting. I usually stay up several hours until sunrise, and then I'll get maybe 5 - 6 hours of sleep and wake up at noon. So I don't want to negotiate a new temperature, because I do think the temperature itself is reasonable to the average person. I think the issue is the air flow. I have tried sleeping in different positions and tried closing / covering my room's vent, but this isn't preventing the air from moving. And our air conditioner unfortunately doesn't have fan speed levels.So I'm not really sure where to go from here. I am thinking about sleeping during the day with the air conditioning off (the people who I live with don't usually keep the A/C on upstairs during the day) and working at night (I have asynchronous work; no real commitments during the morning right now), though I imagine this can have a negative effect on my mental health. I am also looking into talking to a doctor about possible paths towards treatment, since this has been going on for about 4 months now. What suggestions do you have?
Signal	Being going through a great phase with my insomnia recently.I saw a sleep doctor a few months back that cost me a fortune. I was expecting the usual don't drink coffee, don't stay up late, turn your phone off and all the standard things I've been told over the years. But my expectations were wrong. After talking to me he suggested I embrace my insomnia and use my mind being more active at night and to change what time I take my meds and increased my medication (I was taking more than what my normal doctor would prescribe as it wouldn't work. I now take 30mg of Zoplicone and some Melatonin at 2:45 am on the dot. Somehow this time change is working most nights and I'll quickly fall asleep and wake up refreshed in the morning. I'll get 7 hours sleep during the week and a bit more on weekends.I used to take Zoplicine at 12am and I'd struggle to sleep and would often have to take more which would result in me running out early. This may be very boring for some of you. I'm happy with the progress I've made and so far $750 well spent.I hope I can keep this up!
Signal	Hello. I’ve been a long time sufferer of insomnia, for about 7 years. I’ve done it all i’ve taken it all, still have it. The latest installment is not being able to sleep if i have to do something the next day. It can be as simple as meeting your parents or going to a party. I get the feelings a day before it’s about to happen, I subconsciously tell myself i will not sleep and that i will be a mess the next day and that keeps me from falling asleep. Anyone have this? What can i do? Because i cannot see myself living much more like this.
Signal	Obviously google isn’t an answer, but I can’t even find a single google page that will answer what’s happening my sleepI have depression and I’m always dreading going to sleep every night. Whenever I turn everything off and close my eyes, everything that is distracting me from my mental problems is gone and I am just left with my thoughts.So every time I go to sleep, I always start thinking about some bad things going on in my life, negative thoughts, past traumas, you get the point.I can’t stop it. I’ll try to think about something good or what I’m doing the next day but then it just turns into me rambling in my head and wasting valuable sleeping time. Eventually after around 2 hours, I’ve either cried myself to sleep or my crying/attempts to sleeve have lead me to be exhausted and I fall asleep.This leads me to going to bed 2 hours past when I should be and then having to wake up at the same time as normal for school, so I’m absolutely exhausted in the morning.I tried to turn everything off three hours prior to when I sleep and then go on my phone and go on apps like reddit or YouTube to kinda calm things down. It helped slightly because it would help me relax but now it’s something I do to stall myself from trying to go to bed.The only way I can fall asleep in a normal amount of time is if I’m so exhausted that I can barely keep my eyes open; so I don’t have any time to think before I fall asleep.Some people have told me to just stay up so that I get tried, but I’m already somewhat tired when I try to go to sleep; I just can’t stop thinking.What is this? Is there a name for what’s happening to me? Can anyone give some advice?
Signal	im seventeen and ive been in foster care for just over a year. but ive been dealing eith insomnia for years before the system. and im at my third placement where we arent allowed to take naps and we must be up by 10 am. this is so hard for me because sometimes i just cant sleep and i just need a nap. but everyone makes it seem like im exaggerating but this is so serious. my mind and body is so drained.they tell me all these new things to try and tell me to go to bed sooner. its not about that. i just cant get enough sleep. some nights i couldnt sleep at all. and my foster mom just says "if you go to sleep you wont have to worry about it." but I CANT FUCKING SLEEP. this is so stressful.
Signal	Does anybody else have this fear, I have insomnia without it but it doesn’t help all.Is it irrational?
NotSignal	Right now I have a twin spring bed mattress, it's pretty firm. I'm planning to invest in a new mattress, but I've never bought a mattress before and I'm not sure what to look for. So any recommendations would be great. Or even your personal experiences with your mattress. I've also thought about getting a weighted blanket. I don't have an AC ,but I know it occasionally helps me with sleep so maybe I'll invest in one. I have also thought about a heated blanket when the weather gets cold.I live in a warmer climate so I'd prefer a cooling mattress. I've only really had firm beds growing up but I'm open to trying soft ones. My body weight is pretty light, and I don't really sweat. I toss and turn a lot.I also care a lot about sustainability and anything eco-conscious so if any mattress brands also consider those factors that would be awesome.
Signal	Just looking for some reassurance/relief.I’ve never had sleep issues before in my life. Now all of a sudden, I can’t fall asleep, which obviously has resulted in sleep anxiety which just makes it a vicious cycle.I’m in my thirties, no extra stress to speak of, really no reason for this to happen to me.
NotSignal	My problem is that in the morning after very few hours of sleep I dont have energy for the most prat of the day and feel like a zombie, but at night ? Oh boy i have so much energy I just cant sleep, Its almost like it’s unnatural to go sleep( but i want to sleep at night dont get me wrong) and also I very rarely take naps, idk but it doesnt matter how tired I am , I dont feel like sleeping at night.
Signal	Every night I go to bed between 10 and 12. No problems falling asleep (usually), but like clockwork, I'll wake up every 2-3 hours and take a while to get back asleep. I maybe get an average of 5-6 hours of sleep, sometimes less. Only one coffee in the morning and no alcohol or pop even. Doc says sleeping meds contrast with my current meds (ciprolex, wellbutrin and Dexadrine. all taken in morning at 9) Melatonin does nothing, Zquill does nothing, edibles help a little but not much. I do use a weighted blanket. if i don't have music or YouTube playing quietly, my mind won't stop going in circles and will keep me up. I'm desperate, always have zero energy, no motivation to do anything during the day. Doctor is currently no help. Anyone else have this? Have you figured out something that helps keep you asleep?P.S. Assume I have tried the usual basics that Google tells you.
Signal	I think it’s my bipolar mania/hypomania keeping me awake throughout the night. My medications probably does not work that well. I’m on 200 mg of Seroquel and I still struggle with sleeping. I rmb what I dreamt about and I wake up feeling rested but I haven’t the slightest idea when I’d rest. It’s so confusing I don’t feel that tired and I don’t think I got enough rest.
Signal	my doctor tried trazodone but it gave me threatening side effects so he recommended atarax which i declined since antihistamine work poorly for me and then suggested gabapentin.the only thing i know of gabapentin is my dog took it after surgery so i am not sure what this is ive never heard of this used for insomnia.does taking this experience brain fog? hard to wake in the morning? is it a smooth and comfortable feeling of sleepiness as with the trazodone? or exhaustion like hit by a truck as with benadryl?i take extended adderall which makes my insomnia worse so something that can sedate me i need, but not something that will have me sleeping in too long or else i will take the adderall too late in the day and...yeah.
Signal	I've been sleep deprived for 4 years because of anxiety (I'm 17 m btw) and today I went to a psychologist for the first time. She said that I should have gone in to therapy years ago, but she was happy that I acknowledged my problem and that I was ready to do something about it. She told me that if I didn't get control over it soon, I was in danger of becoming insane or developing serious mental issues. My anxiety lead to insomnia, which lead to stress and depression. My general happiness is gone, I go to school, I am social and I have work besides school and I train Muay Thai regularly, but I am not happy. She told me that it was vital for my appreciation of life, to get my sleep together. I'm very easily annoyed or irritated and quite often apathic towards life. Are there anyone that has been through this or relate, who can give me some advice? The psychologist ofc gave me some tools to help me and I set up a second appointment.
Signal	That's all I got. Monday night I stayed up completely. Tuesday night I got 3.5 hours. Last night I got one hour.Considering checking in to an ER for emergency psych care. This is all anxiety driven.
Signal	Newbie here. I struggled with "can't fall asleep" insomnia in the past but fortunately managed to create a pretty normal sleep schedule earlier this year. (Sleep With Me podcast was a great help) But now it's all gone out the window. I'm getting over a long illness, accompanied by really bad anxiety, and it's totally messed up my sleep schedule. While I was sick the couch was kind of my "safe space" where I could actually relax and zone out watching tv or reading. I think it has become too safe. Because now it's the only place I can sleep and whenever I sit down in the evening, I conk out immediately. I've sort of dozed off in front of the tv before, but this is different. I fall into a deep sleep complete with REM for 2-3 hours.I'll eventually wake up and move myself to the bed, and sometimes I can fall asleep again briefly, but then I wake up at like 3 AM and I can't get back to sleep. I've tried getting up and moving to the couch again, but that doesn't help. If I try going right to bed without the couch nap, I can't fall asleep to begin with. Now I'm so sleepy from the insomnia that I can't keep my eyes open when I'm sitting quietly at my desk at work or on the train, like I can fall asleep anywhere but my actual bed.I asked my therapist's advice and she just said not to continue to lie in bed while I can't sleep. So I just get up at 3 or 4 and read until it's time to go to work. Weekends suck because I have no place to be in the morning, so the early wake up call is even worse. If anyone else has dealt with this how I can get over it? (PS: I can't take meds or supplements currently, so only natural methods.)
NotSignal	My sleep cycle is destroyed, I can’t stop waking up at 3-4pm. What’s the point of fixing this...I have pretty bad depression which has gotten worse due to COVID and a lack of routine. Everyday I sleep at 6:30am and wake up anywhere from 3-4pm. I feel miserable and hopeless. I fucked my sleep cycle up beyond repair. How do I get back to a more normal schedule like say, sleep at 2-3am and wake up 11amish? This is really bad and I feel miserable and like a waste. I’m not sure if this is the right community but you guys are pretty inspirational here and I wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar situation or can offer some words of advice? Thank you!
Signal	I got maybe 2 hours of sleep last night and missed my shift. Sure drunk sleep isn't good sleep but surely it's better than no sleep?
NotSignal	So my body clock is completely ruined, and right now I'm sleeping around 8 - 9 am and waking up around 7 pm. My sleep schedule has always been bad but I feel like this is the worst I've been. So, I was thinking that maybe instead of feeling miserable, maybe I should embrace my schedule and live in the night, at least until quarantine is over. How bad would that be?
Signal	This is for people who have insomnia right? I was wondering if you guys could share me your experiences. My brother hasn't slept properly since December 27th , he describes it as brackets in time. When he sleeps he still feels like he's awake and aware. He lost weight and developing bags under his eyes. His immune system is very low and recently experience vomiting and diarrhea. He's becoming depressed because of lack of sleep and nothing he takes over the counter is working! No Z quil, night quil, or benadryl seems to be working! I want to know if anyone is experiencing something this severe! It just happend to my brother on the 27th and it hasn't stopped it literally came out of nowhere! Can anybody share what you went through or does this sound familiar. Please let me know this is urgent.
Signal	I'm have chronic insomnia ia for the past few months. Feels like everthing will never be the same. My hobbies become less enjoyable. Constant headaches and panic attacks. Insomnia is like a giant block in my life that keep me from being happy. Summer is suppose to be the best time of the year but now I feel like shit.
Signal	This seems to be a near nightly experience. That or I sleep for 3-5 hours if I'm lucky. I'm so sick and tired of this and I can't do melatonin, I tried it and would wake up after as little as a half hour at the least and 4 hours at the most it has gotten to the point where if I'm unable to fall asleep after 3 am I just say fuck it and give up.
NotSignal	Recently for the past few weeks I’ve been getting this throbbing inside my head that usually comes with my heart beating fast and it’s driving me crazy please help
Signal	Hey everyone, I’ll m currently feeling quite sad because Ive has virtually no sleep in the past three days.I am severely anxious about not being able to sleep which seems to be my main problem, my legs shake uncontrollably and I can’t stop thinking about horrible thoughts such as that I’m going to die from sleep deprivation.The thing is, as I’m writing this I feel awake even though I am fatigued by the lack of sleep and I’ve even tried to use a 25mg Promethazine tablet that didn’t have any sort of affect on me. (This may be because I can’t swallow tablets so to help me I had to crush the tablet and drink with water.The only thing on my mind is the fact how I can’t sleep and this only makes it worse. I really need someone here to relate to and assist me. I think the reason why this might be occurring is because of COVID I haven’t really seen any sunlight meaning my vitamin D levels are going to be super low which I know affects you. Thanks for reading.
Signal	Hello /r/insomniaA few months ago I was very nervous for a test, and I could not sleep the entire night because of it. The next day I was scared of not sleeping and I did not again, this pattern repeated so much that I was forced to drop out of college. I see many posts here of people who have ''insomnia'' who are able to sleep a few hours, I dont feel understood. My mental and physical health is deteriorating and my heart hurts all the time. I am not able to hold a job or study, I rot away in my parents home. I tried everything from meditating to benzos, and they helped me first but now I cannot sleep without restoril anymore but it has recently stopped working, the only thing I ever got for help was a psychiatrist giving me ANTIPSYCHOTICS(???) which did not help at all and just made me lose even more of my personality. I dont know what to do anymore but I do know that if I keep having to stay up for 72+ hours I dont want to live on this earth anymore. Is there anything that could save me?Greetings. Sorry for the bad writing, I cant think anymore.
Signal	Hey guys, lately I’ve had a lot of trouble falling asleep. About a month ago I tried remeron 7.5mg for just a few days and it seemed to work pretty well except it made me tired the entire day after. I would have kept taking it except I experienced this weird vision change where I had a blind spot for about 20 minutes followed by a bad headache. I’m not entirely sure that was from the remeron but vision change is a possible side effect so I said fuck that and stopped taking it. I’m kind of scared of it now. So now I am considering trazodone. How do the two compare? Has anyone here taken both? Thanks
NotSignal	I’ll keep adding more if I can remember or other people suggest are good tiles.The most important thing isyou should do the last thing you want to do, first.That may be meditating, turning off your phone at a certain time etc. I’ve tried so many different ways only to end up having the last resort work.If you really want good advice here you go:- the colder the room the better.-try turning on a fan for white noise.- watch the most boring thing you can think of that you would never watch, for me this is sports because there is no thinking just doing.- go for a walk before bed until you feel tired.- if you leave your phone at home all day I bet you that you’d fall asleep easier.( but this one is tough)- align your chakras, anxiety comes from an unbalanced throat chakra and insomnia from an unbalanced root chakra.( this is real, you really think these concepts stayed around for millennia for no reason?)- this one is the hardest because of the demands of our world. Spend time with nature(root chakra) or exercise regularly.-And of course eat well but... eating super greasy foods will make you hella tired.( not healthy tho)-forgive yourself and tell yourself that this isn’t going to improve overnight but gradually. - write down your sleep pattern to see how much you sleep, when you sleep, what you do and has made you fall asleep, anything that could be attributed to sleep and after a while you can see the pattern- wake up at same time everyday,
NotSignal	Is there anyone here that cannot tolerate absolutely any caffeine?I've dropped my daily caffeine consumption to about 200 mg. A cup of coffee in the morning is a huge improvement to my life, so this is about the lowest amount I'd like to go. Funny thing is that even with this small amount, I develop withdrawal if I try to quit.But if it's possible that even this amount of caffeine can interfere with my sleep patterns, I'm willing to sacrifice it.Any experience with this?
NotSignal	I hear this approach mentioned a lot around here. It seems very difficult, though if it truly works then perhaps it’s worth it. I’m just wondering if anyone has any experiences to share? How long did it take to start working, etc? Any info would be much appreciated as I don’t want to put myself through such an ordeal if it only “possibly” helps or helps a little. Is it worth it I guess is what I’m asking? Thanks
NotSignal	So I've always had trouble scheduling my sleep, I would either sleep too early or sleep too late. I used to be a really heavy sleeper and nothing would be able to wake me up but that seems to have changed.Since a couple of weeks ago, I haven't been able to get a solid nights sleep in ages. I always wake up about 3-4 hours later and it happened about 20 minutes ago. I wake up feeling fully energised and find it really hard to go back to sleep.I usually listen to stuff as I fall asleep to distract be but I doubt that it's a video making any noise because there's no sound playing when I wake up.So I guess what I'm asking is; do you guys have any tips to stay asleep?
NotSignal	Not sleepy, nor tired. Just one of those days. Who needs sleep, am I right?
Signal	My psychiatrist prescribed me zolpidem in case I have trouble sleeping again. Thing is, I used to take benzos and I was in a very dark place back then and I don’t wanna take something that will make me feel sedated and out of my own body... i just wanna have a good sleep and wake up tomorrow feeling fine and be productive because I work early tomorrow. Is zolpidem any good or will it make me blackout?
NotSignal	Hi everyone. There are a lot of posts on here from people with terrible sleep issues and who claim that CBT-I didn't work for them. If you're reading this and desperate, I'm here to say that CBT-I is working for me after months and months of chronic insomnia. I was never a great sleeper, but after having my baby, I found sleep impossible and exhaustion chronic. I am doing CBT-I under guidance of a therapist, and it was covered 100% by my insurance. With covid, it's been all telemed, which makes me guess that the apps out there that exist and offer virtual coaching/therapy would work just as well if you can't access a therapist via insurance. We started with a sleep restriction protocol that felt BRUTAL at first. I almost quit. But by day 5, I got a solid stretch of sleep. Then, after about 3 weeks, my sleep became MUCH more regular. I could not and still can not believe it. This is the first week where I am allowed to start stretching out the amount of time I am allowed in bed. I want to emphasize that the CBT part of CBT-I was and is really important. Insomnia is an anxiety disorder, and CBT is helping me retrain my brain. I can feel it working, and can lean on the tools I'm learning about and practicing when I'm having a restless night. I have been regularly using an app to journal and challenge my negative thoughts and how I can reframe them.There's a lot of research out there that says CBT-I is the single most effective way to break insomnia long term, even better and more reliable than drugs. I thought for sure I needed drugs to sleep, but it turns out I don't. Just wanted to add a positive post here and share some hope to some of you that may need it!Take good care, all.
Signal	Every time I close my eyes my entire day flashes through my mind and it all goes so fast I can’t control it and it stops me from sleeping I’ve tried everything and nothing is working I’m so stressed out about this I just want to sleep I’m so ducking tired😭😭😭
Signal	I recently decided to take the next big step in my life cleanup and give up the 3-6x/week OTC sleep drug use. Well, day 1 I felt so energized it was terrifying. Then last night it was tough to sleep, and today I’m “wired but tired”. The scary thing is, I remember my insomnia being like this years ago. I’d wake up every morning, too early, with WAY too much excitement for life, then crash after a couple of hours. Never found the cause.
NotSignal	Everyone else is out ready to start their day and waking up and I'm just there like well I haven't slept again. I need to stop getting so disapointed when I don't sleep. I think it would be easier if I didn't get my hopes up but I feel like I should be able to sleep. I don't know insomnia can just be so lonely. Also sorry this is probably not original I'm just annoyed.
Signal	Hello,I'm thinking about doing a short documentary about sleeping pills - a bit about the history and the present-day industry - as well as people's relationships with them. I'm looking for people to talk to about how they use them, if they've had any problems, what has worked and what hasn't, etc. Just a general discussion, really. Right now I'm just doing research to see if I can do this, so any interviews at this stage would be off the record and not recorded unless you gave permission. Basically, I'm just trying to get a sense of how I would do this. And if you're willing to help me out, I'd greatly appreciate it. I've had sleeping problems myself for at least 8 years. I go through streaks - a week or two with good sleep and then suddenly I can't fall asleep, often getting no more than 12 hours of sleep during the work week. Nothing really works except alcohol and sleeping pills, which isn't a very good long-term solution. I take melatonin almost every night, but I think I've built up a huge tolerance to it. As a result of my experiences, I've been interested in this topic for a while.If you're interested, please let me know. Thank you!
Signal	I fell asleep last night without lunesta or Seroquel!!!!!! I can’t believe it. It’s been so long.
NotSignal	I find it easier to fall asleep next to somebody but I don't have a significant other. It's also hard for me to fall asleep with lights on but when I unplug the Christmas lights I have up, my brain screws with me and makes shadow figures. Makes my anxiety spike through the roof. So to calm down I have to listen to specifically a male youtuber talking... Then I can fall asleep at like 3:00 in the f*cking morning
NotSignal	So I have been having a bad sleep schedule going to sleep like at 4 or 5 and I have decided to change it up by going to bed earlier but I can’t seem to fall asleep earlier than usual how can I change this I’m not diagnosed with insomnia and I’m a little worried that I might have it
NotSignal	She has brought it up and she doesn’t care if I go trough sleepless nights, She is like make noises until the morning no respect in this house nobody cares if I’m suffering sweating and going trough withdrawals I’m alone suffering here ty for listening
NotSignal	I was on Olanzapine for 6 months after an acute drug induced psychosis. As I tapered off slowly I started sleeping less and less. I’ve been off it completely for 4 weeks now and can barely sleep a wink. This is destroying my life. Does anyone know why this is happening and/or how to fix it?
Signal	I have this thing that happens to me during sleep every once in a while, it lasts for 5-10 seconds so I get this overwhelming flash of anxiety during sleep, during it there's never been flashes of light or hot/cool sensations just pure panic. it wakes me up and i'm laying there in this panicked state almost like i'm going to die if i don't get up. but as soon as i get up i'm fine, if i go back to sleep it will persist until I get up and start my day, waking me up over and over and leaving me with not a lot of sleep. woke up at 4 AM with it this morning and it's 5:09 as i'm typing this :d
Signal	Since January, I have been sleeping less and less. Last night I only slept for less than an hour and basically running on fumes but my brain is still so active af. I am so tired. I tried weighted blankets, warm pillows, sleep meditation. Keeping my place relaxing and dark. Changing it up (sleeping time). Not working.As much as possible, I will only take sleeping medication as a last resort because I do not want to be dependent on it. Any other advice?
Signal	I don't know what to doI need to spend over an hour to fall asleep and when I do I wake up after 30 minutesAnd before you say, just don't nap, I need to when I can, but now I can't even do that anymore since when I get really tired it still takes over an hour or two to sleep. There are construction sounds almost all day and some of the night, there is snow which brings out the mowing car or whatever its called to clear the streets, and it is so loud it wakes me upSo when I wake up after 30 min I can't fall back asleep because of all the sounds, they ruin my lifeI started sleeping 30 m-1 hour here and there and it's making me want to kill myselfI spend my day screaming and crying and not being able to do anything because my mind is just too fuzzy to put in any work. Hence me just having to lie down even if it takes over an hour just to sleep a little. I'd do anything to sleep atleast 3-4 hours consecutively againYou never know how bad it will get till you get there is now my new motto. I also use earplugs because of the sounds but they sometimes can't block out everything, and me having to adjust them after waking up makes me unable to sleep again. And noise cancellation headphones have a low hum or static sound that I can't stand, so I had to return my pair.I really don't know what to do. I'm going absolutely insane. I wish so bad that there were no sounds and I probably would sleep better than this.
Signal	I’m (21F) and I’ve relied on OTC dipenhydramine pills for 4 years. For the first 2 years I only took 25mg dipenhydramine (1 pill), and then it wasn’t enough so the last 2 years I’d take 2 every night. I can’t sleep without them now and it scares me. Insomnia gets worse when u stop taking pills after so long and I’m so scared of it. I’ve conditioned my room and what not to help me sleep but I think and all the little things but it’s so difficult. Last night was one of the few nights I tried sleeping without the pills, and it was torture. I couldn’t sleep until 7am, and woke up at 9:45am. I just want some help, I don’t want to take these pills anymore for another day. Have any of y’all been through this?
NotSignal	I slept for 5 good days! For the first time in 3 months..now.today. I’m wide awake. My thoughts scare me more than yesterday and ever. It just doesn’t end,does it?
Signal	So, of course, I finally had the courage to tell my parents I have insomnia. (Don't ask why it's just hard for me.) I got:It's because of the phone and blue light or whatever. Bitch I am tired of this. This is my second day which I have to get through without any sleep. I am tired. My body hurts, and I am so so so tired. Coffee? Doesn't work anymore. Energy drinks? Doesn't work either. Yesterday my mother gave me some "herb" tea which "had to make me sleep" surprise surprise it didn't and now I am unwell and feel like shit. I told my mom that I am going home and that I didn't have the energy to be 7 hours at an art course. Of course, I had to stay. So now, I am waiting for the subway trying not to jump under the metro. Because I just can't fucking anymore. This is too much for me. I can barely stand or keep my head up without feeling dizzy and feeling like dying. I sincerely hope I will fall under that metro. Thanks for listing to my rent.
Signal	I don't know why, but I do this almost every night now. I take medicine for anxiety and insomnia, and it helps... Until 3 am. And then it's a 50/50 shot if I get back to sleep. Right now I'm wide awake and considering starting work. It's 4:15 am currently and I just can't sleep. My doctors aren't any help. The most advice I've gotten is "just try". I am, but it's hard when my eyes won't stay shut.
Signal	I recently passed 4 days with less than a combined 7 hours of sleep. Tired as hell, but still couldn’t sleep at all, and I don’t take sleeping medicine because of other health reasons. Anyways, yesterday I went to the public pool in the evening and went swimming for around an hour just for fun and a change of pace. (Mostly because of nostalgic reasons lol) and I went home and fell asleep in less than an hour and slept 7 hours uninterrupted! The comfortable exhaustion and sleepiness from swimming worked wonders for me while I also had fun ugh.
Signal	Pulled an all-nighter to reset so I don’t day sleep. It’s 1:34 am the next day and I’m NOT TIRED AT ALL. In fact I’m super anxious and jumpy. I had caffeine at 7 in the morning (about 6 mg). I had a panic attack earlier (which usually exhausts me), but I’m wide awake. I’ve tried to sleep a couple times. The only thing I can think of is that I took 2 ibuprofen earlier to get rid of the post panic attack headache. I’ve taken my nightly meds (which make me somewhat tired usually) and I’ve had some indica weed (which usually also knocks me on my ass). Help!
Signal	it’s been a month since my problems have started, due to an anxiety episode. Before, I used to go to bed at like 1000 pm and by 1030 I would be asleep and feel myself falling asleep. I also used to wake up to go to the bathroom once per night but I would feel myself waking up. Now, I don’t feel myself falling asleep and I can wake up multiple times during the night, but whenever I wake up, I feel like i’ve been awake the whole time. The only way to know that i’ve been asleep is by looking at the time.. Is it just my anxiety??
Signal	Not some long-term solution but instant one, something that can make you relax when you are too tired to get out of bed and yet too anxious and depressed to sleep, i think my insomnia is what’s causing my anxiety and depression right now - or at least i hope so - so i was wondering what kind of things do you do to help you be relaxed.Listening to white noise and breathing excrecises didn’t help
Signal	Hey guys! I just kind of need to get this off my chest and some advice/words of encouragement.I have the worst insomnia. I’ve gone through three different prescribed sleeping pills from my psychiatrist and no matter what, I feel like it doesn’t work . The first two prescribed pills I would take two pills before bed. They were also for anxiety and it didn’t work for both insomnia or anxiety. The first one was Trazodone. Didn’t work. Second one was Atarax, again DIDN’T work. Now I’m on Gabapentin and they’re 100mg per pill and I take three nightly and I feel nothing for my anxiety and insomnia. I’ve been up since 8:30am and it’s currently 1:35am. I feel like there’s something wrong with me, because they don’t work.Any advice?
Signal	Hi everyone, Has anyone taken trazodone before? I just got prescribed 25mg of trazodone for sleep aid, as I have been struggling with insomnia for over a year now, due to my extreme fear of sleeping. I’ve read some reviews saying that it has caused people weight gain, and am getting mixed reviews online. Anyone have any input? or experience? I’m extremely scared to try and take this medication because I struggle with eating disorders and don’t want to gain any weight
NotSignal	Nothing aggravates me more than hearing the birds start chirping. It's like an ear piercing reminder that I've had another sleepless night. Cue sunrise.
Signal	so im 18 years old so sleep is important i have been taking benadryl and those olly sleep gummies an hour before sleeping for a while and it works great im always out in an hour but i can never actually get a full nights sleep i always wake up early and cant fall back to sleep does anyone know what to do about this?
Signal	I just got my ativan filled earlier and I found that it just doesn’t put me to sleep anymore (I don’t take it every night only when I’ve been up for more than one day and anxiety attacks) so I don’t really have a tolerance. My life has been terrible thanks to insomnia and no treatment I’ve tried works. I’ve tried ambien and it worked amazing but I don’t know how to get prescribed cus I don’t wanna ask the doctor for it
Signal	I’m 16, and I’ve had severe insomnia and depression for years, though I’ve never gotten any treatment. My insomnia keeps getting worse and worse, and I haven’t slept for 4 days now. What am I supposed to do? My only asset before depression and anxiety was my intelligence, but now I feel like I have an IQ of no more than 69.
NotSignal	I used to think my reasoning for staying up extremely late was because I was scared and alone. Nowadays, it’s this weird comfort. I’m not scared of being the only one up.. it’s strange but I guess I’ve gotten used to it and gotten so comfortable with that idea, that it’s about as comforting as my bed and trying to fall asleep.
NotSignal	I've had a month of insomnia starting on May 5th. I followed every piece of advice except medication and nothing has improved. The only solution I can think of it to walk until I feel like I'm going to pass out. I used to walk an hour every day. Even with the insomnia I kept walking but nothing changed. I even two and a half hours one day and still had it. I eventually lost the motivation and stopped walking. So maybe I need to walk even longer, like four or five hours. My new goal is to push myself past exhaustion so I can be tired enough to immediately fall asleep. How long do you recommend I walk for and has anyone tried this?
NotSignal	i cannot count the amount of people who i've seen that said they have had sFI, a disorder with 32 cases MAX worldwide, yet i haven't seen anyone saying that they have cjd or any other prion disease. even given how rare cjd is, it's still way more common than sFI and FFI combined. kinda makes you think.
Signal	Haven't had a solid night of sleep for two weeks now. This makes me extremely tired throughout the day but come nighttime I am physically not able to fall asleep. Which then again makes me tired throughout the following day. By now this is really affecting my work I get done.I think I even started to fear going to bed, since I know what awaits me. After working out yesterday and being "tired" around 10 pm I gave it another shot. It is now 3 am. Not a minute of sleep. I hate this.
NotSignal	I would just like to know how other people handle eating/meals when you don’t fall asleep until 5am...I know night eating is bad but obviously my circadian rhythm is screwed up. Plus I just get hungry in the middle of the night 😅
Signal	I’m fucking tired as hell. I feel powerless. I feel like literally no matter what I do, or what my intentions are, or how hard I try, I just still can’t. fucking. sleep.
Signal	I’m anxious, mostly sleep deprived.I try to sleep and i get hypnic jerks, muscles spasms, totally used to it.5 minutes ago as soon as i started falling asleep i felt electricity/ tingling sensation in my lips, abdomen, my eyes, and my vision was weird when I opened my eyes (like weird shapes or idk)This freaks me out because my mind goes ??? and “WARNING DANGER” at the same time.I never really died but I’m still convinced it’s dangerous, i shouldn’t be worried because I’m good when I’m awale, only happens when i try to sleep.But why can’t I believe it isn’t dangerous? I get scared a lot and i don’t even know what I’m going through
Signal	Hello. I ll BE short I been suffering for really crazy sleep problems. I did some research and this is pretty rare. I have this stuff about 12 years and i have around 20-25 years.I had "episodes" where i strangled one person (hes fine and really helped me to calm down), i throw myself of my bed to the ground several times, hurt my self as well going agaisnt furniture etc, sometimes i scream very loud, punches to the person next to me...and i had an episode where i bited the person next to me. Really Hard and now im feeling very guilty and dont know what to do. To BE honest, im afraid to go to sleep and do something worse.In All those episodes i dont remember anything!!! Its the People In my house That tell me the next morning.I cant go to the doctor because of the covid 19. And to BE honest im afraid That they Will Just give me some pills and i get stuck to them... I know theres probably no doctors here but as anyone ever experencied something like this or knows any case??? I dont know what to do anymore... Sorry for my english
Signal	And I can't for the life of me figure out why. I haven't had a bad bout of insomnia I nearly a decade. I eat well, I exercised, I wound down the way I normally do.And I've spent the last six hours or so staring at the ceiling instead of sleeping and I don't know why.I hate this.
NotSignal	Lately I've been getting lots of hynpic jerks but more recently I've also been hearing voices when falling asleep. Like I'll be drifting off to sleep and hear a sentence fragment which wakes me up again. Wtf is that?? Am I losing it?
Signal	I have tinnitus. I have insomnia. Had trouble sleeping since I can remember. Have had tinnitus for about 10 years. My spouse snores! He has sleep apnea and has a cpap. It helps but not perfect, I was prescribed Ambien about 8 years ago, and have used it ever since. Now my specialist wants me to quit. Told me it’s a terrible medication. But how???? My tinnitus is terrible. I need to sleep! Has anyone been able to quit Ambien and if so how? I use a very low dose, but almost every night, on nights I have a few drinks (maybe once a week) I don’t use Ambien. Well honestly sometimes I have. Is there something safer than Ambien? I can’t do melatonin- makes my tinnitus worse.
NotSignal	Does anyone have any experience or information on insomnia in children? My eldest son who is 9 will wake up after sleeping no more than 5-6 hours and cannot fall asleep again. He has a regular sleep routine and has no intrusive light to wake him up. I've tried putting him to bed a little later to see if he sleeps longer but that didn't work either he still woke up at 4am. I'm worried it's affecting his attention in the day time as he gets agitated quickly and struggled to stay focused from time to time. I think these are symptomatic of little sleep as what I've seen online children his age need around 10 hours sleep a night.Unfortunately I'm concerned it may be hereditary as I was a terrible sleeper as a child and never grew out of insomnia so any advice now would be great as I don't want this to affect him as badly as it does me in his future!
Signal	I ran out of my seroquel and I cant see my psychiatrist for a whole week so I bought some zzzquil (it's a otc sleep aid, basically nyquil without the cold medicine) that night I took one dose 50mg and blacked out and woke up in a psych ward. Apparently I took the whole pack and went into a coma for 3 days. Has anyone else had this effect with it. (Btw i was up for 4 days straight before taking it)
Signal	My Doctor prescribed this to me when I was maybe about 13 or 14 when my insomnia started to get worse. I took it until I was about 17 and wanted to stop it because I hate taking prescription meds everyday. After about a year I didn’t really notice it helping me either. So honestly, I just put up with my body/mind’s bullshit for about a year. I turn 19 next month btw. I just graduated high school this year and with all of the “quarantine” stuff like school getting canceled back in March and my job rarely requiring me to wake up early I feel like I don’t have any structure to my life and I am back to what I experienced when I was younger. It’s very isolating. I’m falling asleep when everyone is waking up and waking up midway through the day. I feel like I’m just wasting my time and I feel so helpless. Sorry if I sound bitchy in this post, I just need to vent lmfao. Was wondering if anyone recommends me to get my prescription again or try something else that has worked for them? I take melatonin pretty regularly (about 15mg) but it’s very 50/50 when it works for me and I feel groggy the following day. (Even on lower dosages)
Signal	I have extremely bad insomnia and ambien works for me, 10mg shuts my brain off enough that I can relax and sleep.My doctor won’t keep me on it though. He says it’s for limited periods of time/it’s addictive. I feel very frustrated that there’s medication out there that 100% solves my major, life-destroying issue but I can’t have it. Do your doctors prescribe ambien or a benzo long term for insomnia?My insomnia is severe and anxiety based, sometimes I do not sleep for multiple days in a row. It affects my work.
Signal	So I've been about 3 months free from smoking cannabis almost daily for the first time in about 6-7 years because it triggered anxious feelings. While I was on it I used to have no problem sleeping because I would be so stoned i'd just fall asleep, but since stopping most nights I have an anxious feeling about not being able to sleep which then makes it very hard to sleep, I've had some nights where I haven't slept atall. I've been taking things like lavender pills and valerian root which help sometimes but I don't want to rely on taking things to fall asleep, but I'm very close to going to get a prescription sleeper, but I know this wont fix the problem. Does anyone have any constructive help that they can offer to control the anxiety? Many thanks in advance.
NotSignal	Hi everyone,I am a student journalist writing about sleep disorders for my latest article. I am having difficulty finding sources for my article. Would anyone be willing to talk me to about their experiences with sleep disorders?
NotSignal	It's currently 7:17 AM and I haven't slept yet. For the last couple of days I was going to sleep around 10 A.M - 10:30 A.M, all because I cannot stop thinking. I just imagine my mom dying, my whole family getting murdered, death, lyrics of songs resembling death, separation, relationships ending, sad songs, I also think of how skilless, untalented, bad everything I am, and I don't cry very often but those last couple of nights I found myself just sobbing in my bed, and last night something in the back of my head was telling me to grab a knife and stab myself, I don't know why, but that was the only time I've ever thought of something like that, and I was genuinely scared of myself and what atrocious things my mind can think of. Sometimes I just wish my brain had an off switch, please help me.
Signal	My head won't settle down. I am so lonely and so fucking depressed. My husband is on the other side of the world. He is my rock and calms me when I am anxious. I can feel myself spinning up. I have done my self talk to settle my head down. Nothing is working. I just want sleep.
Signal	Hello! Due to the Coronavirus, I cant really ask my doctor about this because they’re busy and what not, so I’m planning to ask them on my next call appointment. However, I thought it would be helpful to understand it from others and not a google definition. I got diagnosed with depression and I have a relative who has Insomnia. I have a very difficult time falling asleep and no matter how tired I am, I have to listen to calming music while I sleep or white noise and increase the volume. I have to count my breaths and make everything in my room pitch black. I have trouble falling asleep sometimes because I continue thinking and my mind starts to race and I can’t help it. I have a very thin patience line and easily get irritated and I always wish for quietness. This is probably unclear and there is no way to know because I’m not talking to a professional but I just thought I’d ask. Stay safe!
Signal	Help in going to go insane i dont know what to do anymore. The problem is that i have to be productive over the day because i have to study because of exams. What should i do? i have tried melatonine, chamomile tea, benzos.. xanax worked like a miracle for me 2 weeks ago, right now it doesnt anymore
NotSignal	I've had trouble sleeping since I was a toddler. Since I've been actively aware of my sleep patterns, I've noticed a few things.I either sleep far too excessively, or not nearly enough.Thankfully I have built (work in progress, always) a decent sleep routine and use good medication to help me. I feel I have "beaten" my issues sleeping, after so many years of struggling. But I am wondering - how have your experiences been with having trouble sleeping some weeks and oversleeping others? Is there a specific name for this? I'm finding a lot of different disorders but they seem to skew one way or the other. I know it seems kind of obvious, have a week of shit sleep, have a week of oversleeping to make up for this. But then why can't I just have a normal, consistent sleep pattern? It just needs to be extreme and all over the place? I take micronaps during the day sometimes, regardless of how well I have slept. If you figured out your issue, was the excessive sleep just a result of a lack of enough sleep or vice-versa? Or was it something else? What kind of things do you do to help get your body back on track?
NotSignal	Wish me luck guys, just posted up at the sleep clinic. Probably not going to sleep an ounce tonight, but hopefully this will help me get a solution to the hell ive gone through not being able to knockout for years. Anyone have any sleep study experiences?
NotSignal	That really sums it up. I got 8h if sleep last night but my schedule’s been super off lately. Is this stupid?
NotSignal	Ok so lately I’ve been waking up at random times during the night and that’s never happened before, for the past 3 days I’ve been getting 1-3 hours of sleep and then I can’t fall asleep. Are these symptoms of insomnia or am I just having trouble sleeping?
Signal	Ughhhhh okay just hear me out on this one.My insomnia’s been off and on for years now, and for the last year or so it’s been flip flopping between either me getting to sleep really late and waking up exhausted, or being able to go to sleep early and waking up anywhere from 2-7 times per night. Sometimes it’s a mix of both, which sucks.I tried melatonin for a while, but I had nasty side effects (dizziness, overheating, itching, etc.) so I stopped. I’ve tried everything in the book: cherry juice, breathing techniques, white noise, tea, specific routines, eliminating caffeine and high amounts of sugar, etc. Nothing seems to offer a permanent solution for me; if something works, it’ll work for maybe a night or two before it’s useless. I’ve resorted to crying to the point of exhaustion and eventually passing out on some nights.I’m going to see a sleep specialist, because this is an ongoing problem and it’s causing negative side effects every single day. But in the meantime, does anyone have any advice? What are some ways you guys get to sleep that aren’t the run-of-the-mill ones that work for normal people?
NotSignal	So, I used to sleep at 9 am and wake up at 6 pm and I kinda fixed it by sleeping at 6:30 am and waking at 4:00 pm.But sometimes I get very sleepy at 12:00 am so I sleep and suddenly wake up at 3:00 am for no fucking reason resulting staying awake until 8/9 am and I cant fucking sleep between 3:00 am and 7:00 am so my only fix is sleeping for 4 hours at 6 am and waking up at 10:00 AM and staying awake all day until I get very sleepy at 12:00 Am and sleep normally. Any fix instead of sleeping 3 hours and trying to stay awake the whole day?
NotSignal	Yesterdsy i fell asleep like a baby. For 3 hours only tho, then i would wake up with a wet shirt and can't fall asleep deeply again, maybe my blankets are too warm, also my room is very smallHALP
Signal	Hello everyoneTo get straight to the point, as you can see from the tittle it's about my sleeping part. However, I need to 'add' on this that since about 10 years ago ( I'm 26 years old now ) I started having anxiety disorder accompanied with phobias regarding health. Those fears are the source of what's making me anxious or afraid because I don't get panic attacks ( just 1 in my life ) or have generalized anxiety without specific thought of a health condition I would be afraid of. I'm mentioning this because what I'll describe to you is ( I think ) assosiated and 'followed' to that starting situation. So, my problem is that I'm afraid of not being able to fall asleep. I'm afraid I'll remain in bed awaken all night and the sun will rise finding me tired and exhausted, knowing I wasted a whole night without getting the appropriate rest. How it all began? Just one night 3 years ago when I was chilling in bed chatting with friends etc. on my mobile phone and kinda attempted to sleep very late at about 4-5 am which was not uncommon sometimes for me, as I used to do that at home or even other nights we hang out in bars/clubs etc. without any problem and got back to sleep normally. However that night I was somehow 'nervous' ( we're human beings, it happens ) or had tension sort of thing and couldn't fall asleep. Sun came up and it terrified me, slept a few hours later and began my day exhausted but the thing is I realized it became a fear because of what occured. \*Somehow\* at some points of my life I didn't like to get to sleep very late or when the sun appears but it wasn't related with any fear at all, like now. It was just something I don't like. It is also assosiated with the fact that it tires my body so all the health related fears get worse, maybe that's a 'source'? Last night had this happening and fall asleep at 7 am ( also had other anxious nights but didn't went so far except last night, the first night that caused it and one more night at summer ). I just felt I kinda went into deeper sleep mode cause I kinda watched a 'dream' so it means I fall asleep during the night for a few minutes maybe then woke up because of the tension and remained nervous. \*Whenever\* I have other issue in my life or when my mind is completely 'distracted' from that 'fear' focusing other 'fear' ( example other health situation I'm dealing ) I fall asleep normally without wasting time. In the evenings/afternoons I sleep perfectly normal because I feel there is no pressure on time or anything. At night it all happens. And there is huge impact in my mentality and daily emotion as I do things I normally wouldn't do or refuse to do in order not to cause issue at night. Furthermore to add that this period it has gotten worse as we're all inside at home and kinda spend too much time overthinking or not distracting ourselves, another possible problem is that I spend many hours on PC playing games, do you think that's causing issue? However in the 'past' I did not play games and that fear was also there so.. I also stopped doing sports/work out as well ( I do my whole life ) because I'm not in mood.I'd like to hear your opinions or advices because it's something that's causing big trouble in my life so far and I can't handle it anymore. Something positive or something to motivate me, some tip or some experience. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!
NotSignal	I was coming off a caffeine dependence I had built up as solution to fix my sleeping pattern (it isn't and i'm never doing it again!) couple of weeks later I am mostly through the withdrawals which just lead me back to sleeping in the morning again. So I tried to fix it by falling asleep at 11am and getting myself up at 2pm. The next day I was asleep at around 8am and up at 11am, rough couple of days. So being super sleep deprived you'd think I'd get to sleep early that night but noooope. Lay in a dark room all night tossing and turning wondering if this would ever end until literally almost 6 in the morning, up for 11am again. And now here I am, can someone please just tell me this will be better soon it's driving me to the edge of sanity :(
NotSignal	Hi,Just wondering if Beta Blockers have worked for anyone? I’ve had insomnia for 4 years now and have tried numerous things to help ( Prescribed medications, CBT-I, relaxation, sleep hygene etc etc). The only thing that has successfully worked for me is Zopiclone but my GP won’t prescribe me longer than a week at a time every 6 months. I don’t get racing thoughts at night but I do get physical symptoms of anxiety as soon as nighttime hits. Racing heart, really hot and tossing and turning all night long then the panic that I’m not asleep yet and therefor tomorrow will be awful. I’ve been prescribed Propranolol and have taken it a few times right before I try to sleep. I’ve noticed a definite reduction in my anxiety but still not falling asleep before 5am.....I’ve read propranolol can cause insomnia but just wondering if this goes away after some time taking? Or is there something I can take alongside safely to help?
NotSignal	Posting from a throwaway account because I’ll be brutally honest that my insomnia is caused by not drinking alcohol like I typically did in the recent past. I don’t intend to drink anymore but I’ve slept maybe 5 hours total broken up in the past 48 hours. How long sober before things start to improve? I refuse to take sleep meds anymore. Doing this with no meds or alcohol. I feel really great other than insomnia. My house is soooo clean because I’ve had all this time awake and not drunk or hungover.
Signal	Sometimes it's literally not even anxiety or anything, my brain just decides it wants to be awake until 4am. I've tried antidepressants, hormonal contraceptives, valerian tablets and antihistamine tablets for sleep (not sure what the chemical is - it's called Sominex). NOTHING works. I end up really groggy the next day having slept 4/5 hours. I hate this. Honestly can see myself killing myself if it carries on like this.
NotSignal	I exert myself mentally and physically throughout the day, and am in good physical shape. I have anxiety, and have never slept well as an adult. Many nights I am awake the entire night, other nights it feels like I fall asleep very lightly for about two minutes here and there, but the majority of the night I'm awake. The odd night I'll have a good sleep.Even after the bad nights though, I don't usually feel tired throughout the day. Anyone else? Why might this be?
NotSignal	I’m 60 years old .I have been on BP meds since I was 30. A lot of bp meds. I inherited it fromMy mother (native)100% in shape . I eat a good diet . I excersise. For the last thirty years i have had insomnia . Been off and on opioids for the last -5 years. Currently on a patch. It sometimes Varies but it usually goesGet up at 3:45 am drink some coffeeImmediately and myself in the shower so I can get moving Drink coffee, emails, catch up on the. News. 45 minutes workout with weights Normal day is some physical activityWork which involves driving and sitting at deskExcercise in the evening and working on myLand. Try to lay down around 10 or 11 Right now I’m taking the largest dose of lunesta and CBD oil (no thx)Finally go to sleep around 1 or 2. Wake up around 3:45 and start again.If I miss the 1-3 am window , I won’t go to sleep at allGetting 2-3 hours sleep and waking up at least 3 times during that is a given.This goes on for a month or so. Then eventually I will go to sleep, and wake up in exactly the same position 12-15 hours later. I will hurt so bad from not moving for that long.I’ve seen multiple drs including sleep specialist. A couple of different times I’ve went to the sleep center and stayed the night .My Dr says that I just have a different sleep pattern and he doesn’t know what else to do.I am so use to this pattern of 2-3 hours of sleep per night It is just normal.What I worry about is the stuff I have read saying that people that don’t get enough sleep die prematurely .Anyone else have a sleep pattern like this for so long ?Disclaimer: sometimes I will take a 15 minute catnap. Perfect example I helped a buddy move from Bakersfield to OKC. I flew there, slept maybe 3 hours that night .We drove to somewhere in NM and got to a casino hotel . He immediately went to sleep. I went and played slot machines all night. He woke up at 5 am panicked that I hadn’t went to sleep . I came back to the room and took a shower and said let’s go. Drive to Okc and got there around 10pm. Messed around until about midnight getting him squared away then drive two hours home . Sat in my recliner for about an hour , got a shower and started my day . Went to sleep that night for a about 4 hours. I’m used to it . It drives my wife crazy and my daughter that is a nurse is worried about me . tl;drOnly sleep 2-3 hours a night then after a month or so I crash for 12-15 hours . This has been going on for 30 + years.Drs don’t know what to do
Signal	I've been dealing with sleeping issues for as long as I can remember, but more predominately the last few years.This week has been Hell.From last Sunday to now, I'm pretty sure I've only had a total of about 10 hours of sleep.I only drink a half pot of coffee, early in the AM, and drink nothing but water the rest of the day. I've even went a whole week without coffee and still couldn't sleep. Well, this morning as I was sitting on my couch having my 2nd cup of coffee, I passed TF out for a good 5 or 10 minutes. While caffeinated...I've tried every pill on or off the market, nothing helps. My doctor had me try a heavy dose of ambien at one point and all I did was hallucinate for 2 days because I never fell asleep.I feel like I've lost my mind at this point. Disconnected/disassociated/depersonalized. I feel broken and I don't know what to do.
Signal	I got 3 hours of sleep last night and came back from work at 10 AM and tried to get some shuteye but could not for the life of me go back to sleep. Why is my body like that?? I want to squeeze in some more hours of sleep but I can’t and I’m so frustrated.
Signal	I wanted to know if any of you have had experience using CBD oil as a sleep aid. I have had chronic insomnia for 5+ years now; I wake up 4+ times every night and have trouble falling asleep if I don't intervene (i.e. take a sleep aid). I was prescribed ambien this year but only took it for a few months because it did absolutely nothing to curb my inconsistent sleep pattern. Melatonin does not help either. I can't go through any sleep study right now due to the pandemic.For reference: I am a 25 year old female. I'm about 5 ft and weigh about 95 pounds.
NotSignal	He always says something like “it’s because you don’t do anything during the day”. Right, because working all day and then having baseball from 6 to 9:30 is nothing. I understand
Signal	My insomnia has been escalating during quarantine (I almost never sleep before sunrise now) and it also sucks knowing there’s nothing to do at night. I used to look forward to my evenings knowing I could go out with friends.I hate this shit, I just want to SLEEP. So sick of the constant brain fog induced by sleep deprivation.
NotSignal	I had bad nights three times in a row (5 hours, 4h30 and approximately 3 hours) and I can function normally. No headaches, migraine, memory or coordination problems... Sure I am tired, but just like If I slept 6 or 7 hours...
Signal	I'm having big troubles falling asleep since approximately 15 years. I'm wasting so much time trying to fall asleep and feel exhausted everyday.I have an office job. And drive to the office by car, so I'm sitting for most of the day. Beeing on my computer, phone and tv for most of the day.On holidays I'm often doing hikes (3 to 8 hours) plus a lot of swimming in different lakes. On these days the sleeping goes significantly better. A daily two hour workout on the treadmill in a gym does not help at all.Guessing most of you guys are in office jobs either, my question is: if you have a lot of physical activities outside for several days, does your sleep improve?
Signal	it’s just so annoying that i can lie there exhausted for hours and i won’t fall asleep when it’s night time but yet it’ll be 1pm and suddenly i’ll be asleep on the sofa for an hour or it’ll be 7 i’ll fall asleep and be woken in like 30 mins 1 hour for dinner and then i’ll go straight up to bed and lie there for hours despite having passed out just 30 minutes before and some nights i will end up staying up all night in hopes of passing out at a reasonable time the next day like today i’ve pulled an all nighter and i feel so physically and mentally tired so i finished what i needed to do and then lied down for a nap and i still can’t sleep why won’t my body sleep when i want it to does anyone have any advice i’ve tried meditation and nytol which is on and off for whether it works and unfortunately i can’t listen to music as my phone is the newer iphone without an aux plug so no headphones and my mother would hear my music i don’t know if i should go to the gp or something it’s really impacting me luckily i don’t have to go to school anymore but i don’t know how to talk to the gp i have bad social anxiety and will possibly have a breakdown again if i try to talk to them and i’m not even sure what they could do about it if there’s any point going
Signal	Supposedly they have a lasting sleep technology that involves quick release melatonin for falling asleep fast, then theanine and sustained melatonin release for staying asleep.
NotSignal	Hey there!I would be so grateful if you could answer a couple of questions for my research regarding sleep deprivation (You don't have to answer all of them, I would appreciate any response):1) How old are you?2) What is your occupation?3) When did you begin struggling with sleep issues?4) What was the last time you struggled with falling asleep? Did you manage to fall asleep? How long did it take you? What methods did you try?5) Did you buy anything (whether it's medicine, a gadget, a sleep app, etc.) to help you with sleep deprivation? Did it help?If you have anything to share regarding this topic, I would highly appreciate it!
Signal	Hi all!So on Sunday night, I didn't sleep well at all (5 hours max). Obviously I was tired on Monday. Last night, I went to bed early and got a full 8-9 hours, however today I still feel a little weary. This is obviously the result of needing to catch up. My question is this: if I get 8-9 hours tonight, I should be back at full capacity tomorrow morning, right?
NotSignal	I have nights where I really just can’t sleep, and then the next night I’ll probably be able to sleep but my anxiety prevents me from sleeping. I go jnto full blown panic attacks just thinking about not sleeping. I’ve tried reading, I’ve tried doing breathing exercises but I just can’t stop being anxious about it. I’m on sleep medication but it doesn’t make me tired anymore. I’ve tried switching to another medication but I get really bad withdrawal symptoms and end up in a hospital due to fevers and cramps. Is there anything that helps you relax during bedtime?
NotSignal	Over the past few days I've been struggling to sleep as a whole around 1 am I get dead tired and lay with my eyes closed but can't fall asleep then by 1:30 I'm no longer tired and don't feel tired until around 8 am I'm currently tired but I cant fall asleep i have no idea why its 7:30 am and I still can't sleep any advice on how to fix this would be amazing thank you
Signal	For me just laying there isn't an option as I have severe anxiety and stress (directly caused by my insomnia) and i will start to have panic attacks. Usually i do something on my phone like use reddit or watch YouTube videos until i feel tired enough to sleep. What do y'all do?
NotSignal	Cant sleep? Chat. What else is there to do at 4 am?
Signal	So for the last couple of months, since about June, I’ve been battling bouts of insomnia. I’ve had it in the past, but it’s always passed after a few nights of bad sleep. When it started in June, after about 3 weeks of very little sleep, I contacted a sleep specialist who worked using CBT-i. For four weeks, I worked with the specialist, and the insomnia eased and I eventually returned to a normal sleep pattern for about a month.About 3 weeks ago, I lost sleep and the cycle kicked in again. I lose sleep, worry about it for the following day, go to bed, end up wired for a couple of hours, and eventually nod off. Don’t get enough sleep, it all happens again. Last week, I hit a low point and had a panic attack due to the stress of losing sleep. I spoke to the doctor who prescribed me some benzodiazepines (5mg Lexotan) in case I had another attack. Thankfully, I haven’t and haven’t had to use the benzos. I’ve been under a lot of stress over the last few months (who hasn’t?!). I have a healthy diet and get as much exercise as I can. I’m in talk therapy for the last few years, just to keep my mental health in check. On Monday, in a session, I had a complete breakdown. In part due to absolute exhaustion, but probably compounded by the stress of the last few months. That night, I went to bed and got a full night sleep. I felt like a new person the next day... yesterday. But last night, I went to bed and I’m absolutely wired again. It’s like I’ve taken a shot of adrenaline and I’m wide awake and completely on edge. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like I’m broken in some manner. I get a good night sleep and then get so worked up about hopefully repeating the sleep that I completely sabotage my ability to sleep. I’m beginning to get desperate as I sit here at 3.50am having not slept a wink. Can I break out of this? Am I completely trapped and this is it forever? I’m sorry, I know I’m asking things that are pretty big. But I’m pretty desperate. I’ve tried mindfulness, but it only gets me so far, and it seems to not work for me at all at night. Please, if anyone has gone through something like this and come out the other side, I’m just looking for some hope.
NotSignal	Been struggling with this for a while and thought I'd ask you guys. I have neck pain and problems, and need a new pillow to help. However all of the pillows I find that are 'good for necks' are bad for insomnia. I cant sleep unless my head and face feel cuddly and can sink into the pillow. Any ideas?
Signal	Since early April, I've been experiencing insomnia that has prevented me from falling asleep and staying asleep (I will usually awake after my first sleep cycle; roughly 3-4.5 hours after falling asleep). I am positive the underlying cause is anxiety related to the pandemic given that I was experienced 2 bad panic attacks after obsessing over anything about COVID I could find in the news. This my second time I've dealt with a serious bout of insomnia.I've tried trazodone with very limited success. I really didn't feel like I was sleeping; it felt more like I was sedated in bed the entire night and the side effects were a real negative. I also tried 7.5 mg of temazepam combined with 150 mg of trazodone, but I think the low dosage of temazepam prevented it from really being all that effective. My first bout of insomnia was solved by taking xanax sublingually combined with 15 mg of temazepam nightly for 2 months, but my doctor seems extremely skeptical of temazepam.Now, I've been prescribed ambien. Regular ambien (10 mg + 100 mg of trazodone) would completely knock me out for my first sleep cycle, but I would find myself awake and unable to fall asleep after 4 hours or so. Last night was my first time with ambien CR (12.5 mg + 100 mg of trazodone). It resulted in basically the same results as the regular ambien where I'd wake up after my first sleep cycle. This may be the result of the fact that I chewed up the CR resulting in a more immediate absorption of active ingredient. I will definitely try just swallowing the pill regularly tonight.Anyways, has anyone been a similar situation as me and able to get out of it / find a sleep medication solution? I practice a good sleep hygiene routine and have been meditating daily. Any tips about how to make ambien more effective / better accommodate my type of insomnia (trouble falling alseep + middle-of-the-night wakefulness?Thanks, would appreciate any advice right now.
Signal	Im a 14 year old female, and I cant sleep. It's painful, really. I'm always tired during the day, craving some sleep but as SOON as I try to sleep, i cant. I always cry when i cant sleep, im ao frustrated with everything. Ive tried reading, i have tried to force myself to stay awake for 3 days to try make myself tired, but i cant sleep. I spend countless hours closing my eyes and trying to get rest, but nothing is working. When I close my eyes, there is tension and it hurts. It makes it too hard to sleep. My parents think I'm depressed or faking it, when all I want is a good night's sleep. I'm too young to take melatonin long term, so until I can, i guess I'm stuck like this. Ever since I was 10 I've stayed up all night just for fun, but in these last few weeks, I can't sleep at all. No matter how hard I try. I'm honestly just looking for solutions, so if anyone can help, I will greatly appreciate it.
NotSignal	My experience so far is that it helps me sleep, but leaves me very sedated throughout the next day. Not sure if I'm taking it too late or if it just lasts too long.
Signal	This is such a pain in the ass, and I have to wake up at 5.50am tomorrow for school, it's 1.48am right now. Recently I "fixed" my insomnia by using my phone to watch boring shit until I eventually drift off to sleep, I can't sleep at will until I start drifting off and my phone starts falling off. But today I just got impatient and I slept before I started drifting, and now I'm just stuck in this perpetual loop of consciousness fading back as I drift off to sleep phase.Man is there any better way to fall asleep than what I'm doing right now, I don't want to take any drugs to fall asleep because I am bound to start getting dependant on it and it will probably worsen my insomnia.
Signal	That would be nice. Unfortunately I'm aware of how horrible it feels to go without sleep for that long. It's a nice thought though. Even every other day would be hard on me.
Signal	4 nights of no sleep.Last night was night 5.... and I went to bed early... like 7:30 and was asleep by 8. Actually fucking asleep.Then a fucking alarm went off on my phone for me to take medication at 9pm and woke me up... and that was the end of that! Could not get back to sleep.At around 3am I started to kind of drift off but it was a weird experience. I would be drifting off and then my partner would like sniff in his sleep and I would full on jump and wake up. This kept happening. I would drift off and then something real fucking stupid would jolt me awake.So today I'm just fucking done. I'm over it. In 5 nights I've had estimated 5 hours max sleep.I'm so fucking irritated. I just want every one and everything to fuck off. I don't want to be around anyone. I don't want to do anything. I just don't want to fucking exist. This is fucking torture. I don't know how much more I can take until I give up on life and just fucking end it.
Signal	I’m 15 and for the last few weeks my sleep schedule has Died. I know what you are thinking ‘just a kid on his phone’ but for every 40 hours I’m awake straight I can sleep 5-7 hours if I’m lucky. I’ve tried melatonin, sleeping downstairs and different mattresses, temperatures, ASMR and audio things nothing helps I just stare at my eyelids. I now get migraines and I return to school in 2 weeks and I’m afraid. Any advice?
NotSignal	I have all nighters, about 3 per weeks. I have no slept in 18 hours,, help?
NotSignal	Hello, for most of my life from young age, ive had issues being able to stay on a normal sleep schedule, and do not have insurance to go to specialists or doctors to figure out what can be the cause or how to try to fix it.I seem to be nocturnal where once it hits like 6pm or so i wake up even if I was dead tired moments ago, while also being up for over 20 hours or more, or when ever im sick with a feverish feeling at night it doesnt bother me only makes me feel hungry, while during the day its like im dying and need to rest and end up falling asleep, which also hinders my problem of ruining my sleep schedule.I try things like not eating/drinking certain things or getting out of games around when you should typically get ready for bed like 10-11pm but never get tired and next thing i know its going on 6am, and if i try to go to bed and try to fall asleep i just lay in bed for couple hours not being able to fall asleep and end up drenched in sweat, which makes it even harder to fall asleep, no blankets on and with fan/air conditioning on.I've been like this since very young, I do not know exactly how young but young enough i still shared a bedroom with my 1 year older brother, i know this since i stayed up till like 2am and my grandma coming in "yelling" for me to go to bed because of school which happened like every night.I'm really sick of this since i cant tell if ill be available or not for things like work, appointments, hanging out ect.I know this isnt just because i have no job and pretty much just sit at my computer 24/7, but like above even when i had school i did "kinda" stay on a sleep schedule but it wasnt good, like staying up till like 2am from going to bed at like 10pm and then sleeping on the bus to school and then throughout highschool, cant recall falling asleep in elementary/middle school, but highschool (normal highschool 7am -130pm) i would sleep through classes or skip class and go into in school suspension class and sleep there. Tho while at a (christian school 9am-330pm) i would be fine but still stay up late, guess the slight time adjustment was enough to get the sleep i needed from 2-8, rather then 2-530.I tend to also have less sleep most of the time, i will wake up randomly no alarm or loud house like family watching tv too loud, or pets barking. Like for example i could have been up 30 hours and finally go to bed but wake up in 2-4 hours fully woken up that i cant go back to bed and can, without trying, stay up for a day.Does what i explain give anyone ideas on what medical condition i could possibly have or is this more i dont use enough energy during the day or something like that? Only thing i can think of since when i was really young i did have friends in the area to play with unlike when i got older and they moved away, yet did have a few temp jobs where i did some manual labor but still had these issues-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: forgot to mention I can really only go to sleep if im completely exhausted or if i do manage to go to bed before being exhausted ill 100% only sleep for 2-4 hours, ive tried many times trying to adjust my sleep schedule this way at like 10-11pm and wake up at 2-4am and then practically collapse around noon and then wake up around 6-8pm. Only way to adjust my sleep schedule seems to be to stay up as long as i can and sleep as long as i can till i happen to wake up around 3-6am and end up exhausted at 5-6, which is the time if i stay up past its like 50/50 if i break off this sleep schedule and stay up to 6am
Signal	I am not quite sure if this is the appropriate place to post this but I’ve become completely hopeless in terms of finding help. I’ll gladly take down this post if it doesn’t match the subreddit. If anyone has a better place to post something like this let me know as well. Okay, you read the title, I cannot sleep on summer nights. Every single summer ever since I was a young child I have been kept awake by extreme feelings of fear and paranoia. As soon as the sun sets I become terrified of implausible events taking place, such as being stalked, haunted, murdered in my sleep, etc. I also happen to have a pretty bad case of autophobia. (I’m afraid of being alone.) I have very similar feelings when I’m in my room alone, even if someone is sleeping in a room just down the hallway. When my fear kicks in, there is no stopping it until the sun comes back up. Scary things pop up in my head and if those things are physically possible then I fear them as if they are reality. Example: It is physically possible for someone to be staring at me from my window, so I have to close my blinds otherwise I’ll have an ongoing panic attack. On the rare occasion that I end up falling asleep, I am almost always woken up by an intense nightmare only an hour or two after falling asleep. I have tried melatonin, I’ve tried having the TV on as I try to sleep, and I’ve tried everything that google has to recommend. I am posting this here in hope that someone has had or is having a similar experience to me and has some kind of advice on how to make things better. Even if you don’t have any advice, I’m dying to talk to someone who has had experiences like this. My family doesn’t really take me seriously and my friends think I’m crazy so please, if anyone has been through this let me know.
Signal	Can i get some suggestions of how people handle the anxiety of not being able to sleep again after a day or few nights of no sleep ? with meds i have sleeping pills that i hardly used i think of them as the last resort.
Signal	I just want to get things off my chest.I have had insomnia for a few years now, and for the most part I just simply cannot fall asleep. My insomnia comes and goes, and it's not as bad as when I first started experiencing it.But lately it's a whole different type of insomnia. I now can't seem to get any deep sleep. I can fall asleep relatively quickly but I wake up feeling like I didn't get a wink of sleep. I get up and my eyes are so dry I sometimes wonder if they were even closed. I feel like my brain was on all night and I have no power over it.I'm kind of losing it. I just don't see what I can do. It's not like I can wake up and do something about it. I'm forced to remain unconscious with no benefits. I've felt much more energized and rested on 3 hours of sleep.Just frustrated and felt like venting. I'm just so sick of being controlled by sleep...
Signal	I’m really done with this anxiety I’ve been having. It keeps me up all night and can’t stay asleep. It also doesn’t help that I now know what sfi is. :(
NotSignal	Although I get to sleep, I enver feel rested. my cirdadian rhythm is 100% upside down. I work from home full time so I have a lot of free time. These naps are like an addiction though and I dont think they are helping my mental health. Any suggestions?
Signal	Sleep hits around 2 am if I'm lucky. I sleep fitfully, wake often, and dream of things I don't talk about when I wake. I get up between 6 and 7 am, I take my medicine and I go to school, or lately I don't feel up to it.For the next 2-4 days I don't sleep at all. The first two days are fine, if there's a third I begin to notice the effects of sleep deprivation. If it's four I feel like I've transcended reality- although I know I haven't, I just need sleep.No medication works, no technique works. A perfect regimen and laying down and getting up at the same time don't help. Meditation, music, white noise. Nothing helps. I get maybe 10-13 hours of sleep a week. I've had insomnia even as a baby. My mom says I've never slept well. It got worse as I aged, as my mental health got worse. I slept so soundly for about two and a half months though. My partner in the bed. Knowing I was safe.And then he left for a bit. And I had trouble sleeping. And then we had a traumatic break up. I started showing neuolgically problematic symptoms in Novemebry and it got worse.And then I had a seizure caused by an unmonitored Chiari Malformation that had caused all my symptoms and now I'm here.My psychiatrist feels bad he can't perscribe me anything that will help, that none of his tips or arcticles made much difference. I appreciate his effort.My therapist and my GP know I'm trying things that failed. Over and over.My neurologist is the one who saw the Chiari in 2018 when I was having minor symptoms, told me my symptoms weren't the Chiari (they were) and sent me to an ENT who was very concerned that at 17 I was displaying late stages of bilateral Meniere's didease. "40 year olds get this... And it takes years for the kind of hearing loss you have, and years to become bilateral, I don't think I've ever even HEARD of a 17 year old with bilateral Meniere's, or even unilateral Meniere's with your severity of symptoms and hearing impairment!'Apparently this did not matter to my Neuro.No amount of telling him the strategies my other providers and I have tried that haven't worked convinces him that maybe I need stronger medication. He admits it's the Chiari 'oh yeah, they'll do that alright'. But wants me to try all the tips and tricks that I've been trying for my entire life that haven't worked. It's so much worse now and I can't get anything to help.
NotSignal	I have tried literally everything to sleep better. All the meds on the market except one I cant take due to a mix of reasons, herbal supplements, dieting, exercising, sleep hygiene, and more.If this sounds like you, you may want to go see a sleep specialist about sleep apnea. I have recorded myself sleeping before and I've slept over with friends and I dont snore. But, it was found yesterday that due to my basic anatomy, I have sleep apnea.My tongue is to big for my mouth and I choke on it as I sleep. I cant fall asleep because it has become an unknown trauma for me.Please get checked if you cant sleep after trying everything. I never thought I could have it. But, going on the cpap is apparently life changing. I cant wait to get mine at this point
NotSignal	at this point i’ve kinda given up on trying to sleep at night, and i’m getting sick of listening to the same tunes. any music recommendations for passing the nights and days?
Signal	I can’t get myself to fall asleep, I’ve taken to walking around all hours of the night otherwise I’m just anxious sitting at home. I’ve been getting tons of exercise so I guess that’s the silver lining. My body is exhausted though and I don’t know what to do. I have no idea why but my mind is terrified of falling asleep.
NotSignal	I am no doctor but according to research meditation helps people in terms of sleep and it could help you too. You could try this meditation channel on youtube called Nature Inspired Meditation. You should probably see a doctor too
NotSignal	I can't sleep bc of migraines, but not in the way that you would think. See, I (like most of the people here) am a late sleeper, but yesterday I had one of the worst migraines I had in a while. When I have migraines, I sleep. IDK why nor how, but i sleep for ~7 hours. But yesterday I slept up of 12 hours and now i can't sleep.
NotSignal	Please let me know If this isn’t the right place and I will remove. I recently got some CBD oil to help me sleep. I was wondering how many drops to take. It’s a 15ml bottle. It has 240mg CBD and 30mg THC. Thank you!
Signal	I just got an ad for Cloudy Melatonin. I take the Olly melatonin daily and it works meh. Has anyone ever used Cloudy?
NotSignal	What bed time tricks work the best for you? I always see the 4-7-8 breathing thing but doesn’t work, does it work on anyone? And what else do you recommend?
NotSignal	I have sleep maintenance issues, but strangely in the work week and Sunday night, it is hard for me to stay asleep whereas on Friday and Saturday it works much better.
NotSignal	I just lay for hours trying to sleep and then suddenly my alarm clock goes offline, and I have to go to school tired...Anything I can do?
Signal	I have sleep maintenance insomnia, meaning I wake up in the middle of the night and am not able to fall back asleep. I actually used to have trouble falling asleep but take melatonin which helps, but I'm still up very late occasionally. I also have ADHD and take meds which definitely interferes with my sleep in some way. Before all this quarantine shit happened, I would wake up somewhere between 3-5 am, once or twice a week. I don't know why my insomnia has been so bad lately, but I've been waking up at 4 am 3-5 times a week lately. Has this been happening to anyone else? Or is it just me
Signal	I have struggled with insomnia for the past 2 years, often I end up taking benadryl, melatonin, or Zzquil if I can't sleep by 2 AM, but it is on and off. Last week, the first week where everything was shut down, I slept the best I slept in years. This week, it has been worse than normal. Even with Melatonin and benadryl I couldn't sleep. What should I do? And why when I have insomnia do I start worrying about death?
NotSignal	Seriously, I don't know how to fall asleep. I don't know. Any time I actually want to sleep I can't, I can only sleep when I'm specifically trying to stay awake. Can someone please tell me what it feels like? I just sit there fading into the dark, staring at hypnogogia, completely awake. What do I do?
NotSignal	This is my first time even looking in this sub and purely at a glance it's super obvious I shouldn't be here. It's just people with the exact same problem making the exact same complaints I have that have no legitimately reproducible solutions. It's mostly just an echo chamber of misery.Just looking at the titles of some of the posts here is too real. It just makes the anxiety worse. I've had horrible insomnia for over half my life. I already know that there isn't anything I can do to make it better that doesn't involve getting addicted to drugs that force you to sleep. I don't want to live with my problems and then sit in an echo chamber about how the neighbors and crickets and idiots going "HaVe yOu TrIeD *MELATONIN*" never actually stops.This might be one of the single worst place on reddit for people of its targetted audience to actually be. Without a shadow of a doubt, the only tool I've ever found with even the slightest effect on my ability to sleep is simply the ability to purge thoughts and not focus on the problem.I came here, as I am sure many others have, in a perpetually half-hearted and hopeless effort on another sleepless night that maybe there'd be some nugget of wisdom or whatever here that I haven't already heard a million times before. But there isn't. There never is. You either have it good enough that you can overcome it or you suffer.As truly and surely as the sun rises, it is as hopeless an ailment as anything else that can kill you. I spend every single night of my life watching my wife fall asleep at 8pm to get 8+ hours of perfect unbroken sleep knowing that nothing but perpetual anger and despair awaits me while I get to face the fact that a third of my conscious life is the loneliest solitude I will ever face.There are people who straight up die of insomnia. No one who has it bad will ever dispute the primally instinctual feeling of just *knowing* that this is something which might be the end of them one day.Knowing all of this, you have to be able to know what's too poisonous for you to handle. I'm sure there are some people who get some sort of warm fuzzy feeling of goodness by having people to talk to about it but I'm not one of them. And I honestly doubt that many insomniacs are. Though I have, ironically, nothing but comraderie for the people here...a simple perusing glance here is enough for me to know I don't belong.God speed and good luck to you all. May your searches one day bear fruit.
NotSignal	All my life long, i fall asleep within 2-5mins, honestly every night. I've been with my gf for 4 years, i think she fell asleep maybe 2 times faster than me? In the whole 4 years! I always took it for granted, what a fool i was.The current problem? My sister. I still live at home, plan to move out but thats not going to happen until next year. She has a bf and everytime he's over, they are so fucking loud. And no, i don't mean the actual fucking part. That sometimes happens to i guess, but they hide it well. I mean just the fucking chatter and laughing at 1:30am in the morning. They are college students, so they rarely have to go sleep earlier.The funny thing, it has never bothered me before up until 2 weeks ago. I don't like staying up late, at all. I tried doing an all nighter at the age 12 to skip a family event, horrible mistake that left me with a semi panic attack and a trauma to never stay up very long. So 2 weeks ago i picked my gf up from a small birthday party at 2am (wasn't very comfortable with the time but oh well), we were at home at 3am and at that time i already started to get anxious about not being able to sleep, especially in those spring summer nights, where the nights are pretty short. My gf fell asleep very quickly, as i mentioned earlier that doesn't happen very often, which contributed to my anxiety of not being able to sleep. Stupid stuff, i know.Then my sister started. Watching netflix and chatter until 5am. It wasn't necerssary as loud, but infrequent and loud enough to fuel my anxiety and keeping me awake. I texted her, obviously to keep it quiet but she isn't the most empathetic Person, replied that she wasn't loud and stuff.So, here were are. Since those 2 weeks, i just can't fucking sleep in my own house anymore. If i sleep at my gfs place, its fine. If her boyfriend isnt there, its mostly fine. But if hes there, my anxienty kicks in and i guess thats a bigger problem than the noise itself.Tried earplugs, but they feel uncomfortable. White noise sometimes helps i guess, but not enough. I even fucking tried to sleep in a different room (we have a spare guest room) but its under their room so it gets noisy too.I am a very calm, laid back person, very empathetic. But i get really pisses of with a rude behaviour like this. If she really tried to keep it down it would be fine i guess, but she thinks that its almost funny.Last night i went to bed at 11pm and could sleep until 2am i guess. Again, for people who suffer from actual insomnia its no big deal i guess, but for me its something very new.I just need to vent a bit i guess. But if anyone has some tips, i would appreciat it alot.
NotSignal	Ughhh there have been so many problems today but this just takes the cake. I'm sad and it's so late that even my friend who sleeps late is asleep so I can't talk to him. Which is kinda a good thing since I don't want to tell him that I'm too much of a wimp to sleep when I'm sad. So now I'm lonely and sad, even better. I have a massive headache too, so now I'm just scrolling through my phone and being upset because I don't want to try to sleep with all these thoughts running through my mind. Oh, and I'm also blasting rap music through my headphones so that I can minimize hearing my thoughts, although it's not that effective. I was doing so well, sleeping at 10:45-11:30 every night because of the quarantine, but nooo I just had to get sad and lonely tonight so now I can't sleep.Sorry for my rant..
NotSignal	Looking to go to a doctor soon for my Insomnia and am looking to get prescribed Benzos. I was wondering if this is difficult to do or if you have any tips to do this. I've read many people get prescribed anti-depressants or anti-psychotics and want to know if this is avoidable. Thanks!
NotSignal	Whenever I have work or I need to wake up early for something I can’t sleep? Like on the weekends I can sleep fine like even if I go to bed at 2am I’m not stressed bc I know I can wake up whenever. During weekdays I’ll be lucky if I can fall asleep no problem at 2am tho:/ any tips for how to not be so anxious about losing sleep? Any supplements or changes in the way I can think about it that I can actually stick to?
Signal	So either two things happen when I sleep: I either go to sleep at about 3am and get up about lunch time (unless I have college). Orrr I attempt to sleep early which takes me forever but I'll end up going around 11pm - midnight, and I'll wake up about 5 times from repeated nightmares that leave me feeling so anxious and scared. I wake up multiple times- at 2, then 4 and then 5am. Idk what to do
Signal	So I have been dealing with a delayed sleep type disorder that inst as severe as insomnia but the doctors still classified it as insomnia. This has been for as long as I can remember. Once school came back around, even though this sounds bad, Covid was one of the best things that has happened to me all year. It got me out of school and let me sleep for the first time sense the summer before. And now that school has came back I begged my parents to allow me to do online school. (remote learning) I have been coping with my sleeping disorder better lately and am the happiest I have been in forever. I felt a sense of comfort and overall felt not stressed due to the fact i got to stay home and do my work. I am a very good student, in my last year, and my GPA is fine and so are all my grade. During the first week of school I was doing great, waking earlier, sleeping better, and getting all of my stuff done. Today they informed me I needed to go back to school. "We have to get you on a schedule" and "there is no changing our mind." Now that i have to go back i started breaking down, panicking. I felt like my life was going really well honestly and I thought I was going to get it on track. The only thing going through my mind during every minute of the day is the fact i have to go back, now I can't sleep, feel sick, sometimes I just cry. I assume that I am over reacting or whatever but I don't know what to do. I go back in a few days and my only opportunity to keep online school is if the doctor says it'll be better for me. I'm not sure how to react to it all and I just feel lonely all of the sudden, this post is just to make me feel like someone knows the story TBH.I am lazy and not fixing any mistakes, if someone has a method of dealing with these mental breaks please let me know.
Signal	Hi guys, just tried out Doctor on Demand for insomnia and got prescribed Hydroxyzine 25mg. Anyone here have experience with it? I would’ve preferred a Benzo personally.
NotSignal	For the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with sleeping issues. 2 weeks ago I would fall asleep at 11 or so and wake up at 3 and struggle to fall asleep. Last week was the worst. I kept waking up and had this weird adrenaline rush before falling asleep and it would keep me up. Also while try to go to sleep I feel my heart racing and would get cold sweats trying to fall asleep. Sometimes I would feel dizzy in bed but that is because I feel my heart beat. I take a few homeopathic pills before going to sleep they help but not always. This might be stress I’m going through but I’m not sure. Is there anyone who has felt the same?
Signal	It is really basically prescription melatonin?Literally the only side effect was a possible reduction in testosterone and that kind of scared me away from the med.
NotSignal	Hey guys! Just want to share something that has been helpful to me in my journey as I've spent a lot of time over the past couple of months learning through CBT-i and have seen a HUGE impact. In my experience, unless you have a unique medical condition (most of us don't), insomnia is about 98% thoughts/attention/anxiety and 2% sleep hygiene/supplements. This doesn't mean sleep hygiene doesn't matter, or that supplements don't do anything. It means that they aren't the main thing. Insomnia thrives on attention, and in a season where we're all stuck at home we're giving it a whole hell of a lof of attention.The more we can focus on our negative thoughts about sleep, and through education learn that there is actually a lot of misinformation about our insomnia, and that insomnia loves to keep us thinking about it all day and all night... we begin to see progress. I'd encourage you guys to look up resources from folks who teach CBT-i and do some education. The more we can relieve our anxiety and efforts to sleep, the more we get out of the way and sleep can come. Keep on keeping on, friends! Take a deep breath, sleep will come. Cheers!
Signal	I hope this is the right sub for this. Due to recent legal issues, I have to stop smoking cannabis for the foreseeable future, hopefully only a couple months. It's still listed as a schedule 1 narcotic in my state here in the United States.From as early as I can remember, I've always had problems falling asleep. When I was a teenager, I brought it up to my parents often. They would always just tell me the same shit. "Just close your eyes!" "It's all in your head!" Through my teenage years I would end up chugging melatonin or popping multiple benadryl. The benadryl actually became a problem because I would have to take way too many. At 18 (I'm now 27) started smoking weed and only ever have a problem sleeping when I can't smoke. The thing is, I've always been able to smoke roughly the same amount and get to sleep fairly easily.I'm just looking for some alternative until I'm able to smoke again.First thing. No pills. I appreciate most modern medicine, but I've had more than my fair share of issues with dependence on sleeping pills. Any and all tea tastes disgusting to me and has never worked.My mind races way too fast for meditation. I have problems with being quiet or sitting still (another thing that weed helps with).Any help is appreciated, although I've tried mostly everything else besides what I listed above.
NotSignal	When people say "just think about happy things while trying to sleep, eventually you will fall asleep." Like does this actually work on anybody since when I do it does the opposite. It's probably because my brain is constantly working trying to think of happy things which is preventing it to shut off and drift to sleep.
NotSignal	Like. I love you too Freddie. But just because I'm asleep does not mean I'm dead, man. He has taken it upon himself to wake me up on those rare nights I do get to sleep by trying to make me pet him or licking my face. (His breath STINKS) I absolutely love my cat, but come on. I can't lock him outside of the room or he scratches on the door or yowls loudly outside the room. I've got a small child I need to sleep or I 100% won't get any sleep. Like yes, I can't sleep 5 out of 7 days and end up going downstairs to get a snack or just to sit and watch tv. But that doesn't mean you have to wake me up when I do sleep! Rude. 😂😭
NotSignal	Ever since May 5th there has been a pattern where I'll only be able to fall asleep when the sun rises for two to three weeks, messing up my circadian rhythm, and then it will just go away. Then I'll be able to fall asleep at night in an instant for about one to two weeks and then out of nowhere the insomnia comes back and the cycle repeats itself.
Signal	I’ve gotten max an hour of sleep each night. I don’t understand why, as I’m not anxious or ruminating or anything. I’m just tired. They only thing that’s changed is I started taking a new brand of birth control with a higher amount of estrogen than before. Everywhere I look says that estrogen promotes sleep so idk.
NotSignal	Ever since I was 5 I had to take melentonion before bed. But still even with it, I only get around 3-6 hours of sleep, usually falling asleep at midnight and waking up at 4. I know this isnt healthy for someone my age (13) so I was wondering what I should do. Any suggestions?
Signal	For context, I’ve been dealing with on-and-off chronic insomnia since I was 7, so I’m used to barely sleeping 😂😂😂 I’ve been having an awful week, but last night I got home, laid down, and actually fell asleep pretty fast!!! Plus, I managed to stay asleep all night, apart from 1 instance:) I’m really happy!!!!
Signal	I have been a lifelong insomniac and for the most part, I’m just used to it. For most of my adult life I’d been using a combination of alcohol and melatonin to help me fall asleep(along with good sleep hygiene) and while it isn’t full proof, I slept better than I did when I was younger. The problem with booze is that two drinks veeerrryyyy easily turns into a six pack a night and it’s a constant balance for both my liver and weight. A year and a half ago, I decided to quit my drinking habit due to my mental health and just like that, my insomnia came back in FULL FORCE and I was regularly going 36-48 hours without sleep. Luckily, I made my own schedule but it was not healthy at all. A couple of months ago, my schedule became more structured so I went back to drinking to help me fall asleep. Unfortunately, my mental health is still precarious, not to mention the fact that I’m loving how much weight I lost, and so damned easily. Well, two months ago I started taking magnesium for a completely unrelated reason and oddly enough, with the melatonin, I no longer need nor do I want to drink in order to fall asleep. I still need to keep good sleep hygiene and I’m not falling asleep in 10 minutes like those well rested bastards who are able to do that, but this is the longest I’ve gone without a nightcap AND gotten a full night sleep for this many consecutive nights in probably my whole life. (To be sure, I’m still drinking when I want to, I just don’t need to anymore). Anyways, just thought I’d share. I know there are a lot of people on this sub who are genuinely looking for answers and not just here to piss and moan about how tired they are (we get it, you’re tired, WE’RE ALL TIRED). Maybe this will help someone else.
Signal	For a good few years now, I've had major issues with insomnia. I've tried everything, ive been on trazodone, mirtazipine, clonidine, xanax, klonopin, gabapentin, hydroxyzine, seroquel, ambien, lunesta, zolpiclone, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, sonata, over the counter sleep aids like, melatonin, diphenhydramine and doxylamine. I've tried various herbs: kava, valerian, skullcap, passionflower, chamomile, blue lotus, lemon balm, and catnip. I've also tried dieting, I eat extremely healthy, and I exercise daily. I've tried meditation, yoga, and aromatherapy. I try to go to bed at a set time and wake up at a set time, I turn off lights and devices. Somehow none of this had even made a dent in my insomnia and sleep quality. When I do get a full night's sleep, which is really rare, I dont feel rested at all, when i sleep around 5 hours i feel okay till the afternoon, then feel awful. Sometimes I dont fall asleep for days, longest period of time without sleep being a full week. I just cant do this anymore, I've not found any relief, I cant get to sleep, when I do, I'm not rested when I wake up, I've tried tons of medications, all did nothing but have multiple side effects. I just dont know what to so anymore. In a last ditch effort, I figured I'd ask reddit, is there anything you guys can think of that might have even the slightest chance of success? Thanks in advance, I hope you understand my concern.
NotSignal	I can’t sleep, and if I do I fall asleep at like 4:00 or 5:00 am. Last night I got no sleep because my mind was racing the whole night. Does anyone know what I can do?
NotSignal	I'm gonna try light yoga -simple postures, nothing crazy..taking it real easy. Stuff like downward dog, ec 5-10 minutes a day. I'm not.working with an instructor so I'm erring the side of less is more.This is my third day, gonna see if an impact is made after a month. Wish me luck will report.
Signal	For those that have had severe insomnia for years, and don’t expect it to go away, how have you managed to maintain a normal life?Can you have successful relationships with this condition? Hold up normal jobs? Is it even possible to raise kids with severe insomnia?It’s disrupted my life so much because I feel AWFUL nearly all the time, I seriously wonder wonder if any kind of “normal” life is left for me. But I’m not yet willing to give up on trying to live one.
Signal	Three questions.It helps me sleep, sure, but it's a light sleep and I wake up a lot during the night but fall back asleep. Will it turn into a deeper sleep the longer I'm on it? I've only taken 1mg for two nights.Insurance only covered 15 pills for 25 days. What? Is that normal? Why? Do I need to try other things before it'll be approved? Do I need to call them and make an appeal? Will I be forced to pay out of pocket for the other 15 pills? I've previously been on seroquel, mirtazapine/remeron, trazodone, temazepam, and atarax/vistaril. I have not tried ambien and I get ketamine infusions, which benzos make ineffective, so xanax, klonopin, ativan, and temazepam aren't options even though temazepam worked in the past.What's the difference between ambien and lunesta?I'm planning on being on this long term. My remeron dose makes me unable to sleep and my mood is doing so well on latuda and remeron (diagnosed bipolar) that we want to keep the psych meds the same and just add something for sleep. Remeron doesn't work for sleep at higher doses and I'm on 30mg.
Signal	I am looking for opinions on trazodone as an insomnia medication. Does anyone have any positive experiences or negative side affects they can share?
NotSignal	Fresh sheets, good sleep hygiene and a clean, safe spot to sleep?It's time for another rousing round of THE ITCH GAME!!My foot itches. My leg itches.I can ignore the one on my wrist. I'm going to SLEEP.My back itches.My arm itches again.My wrist is burning, I HAVE to itch it.Okay, okay. Deep breaths. Focus. Meditate. Concentrate on the silence provided by your ear plugs and a noise machine. Stare into the pitch black darkness of your "black out curtain and shaded" room. You do NOT itch.But your thigh does. And your back, in that one spot you can't quite reach, aaaah there it is.Finally - darkness. Silence. Exhaustion. I think we can finally -...GODDAMNIT WRIST, WHY ARE YOU ITCHING?
Signal	Took doxy last night and when i played tennis today, my brain was so foggy and had difficulty concentrating, even after 2 cups of coffee.Any way of dealing with this?Does taking it earlier help? Like 3 hours before bed time for example?
Signal	I am currently 16 and about every single night, I woke up about 3-5am and this kept happening for months and mayne even years. Whenever I woke up in middle of night, I have no trouble falling back to sleep but when In I wake up in the morning, my head feels horrible. I kept a consistent sleeping schedule of 11pm-7am and usually have no problem falling asleep. I exercises alot during the day, does yoga, had a healthy diet, avoid water near bedtime, and hardly have things to worry about (except this problem). I don't know what I can do much now as my parent don't believe I need doctor's help as it's too expensive and probably a "mental" thing. I am thinking about taking sleeping pills if they keeps happening.
NotSignal	Anyone deal with this? I can sorta fall asleep watching tv but as soon as I roll over to actually sleep I feel a shaking in my chest, stomach and sometimes legs like a train is going by in the distance. I'm not actually shaking but it keeps me up all night and I usually have to dope myself on benedryl to sleep.I've been having insane stomach issues lately and I'm wondering if this is caused my large amounts of trapped gas. Talking to Dr again tomorrow.
Signal	I went to sleep at 7 p.m. finally last night only to wake up at 9 p.m. it’s currently 10:30 in the morning and i’m still awake. this is beginning to drag me under into deeper depths than just exhaustion. i’m honestly afraid that i can no longer function as a person. i don’t know what to do. the people around me aren’t understanding, my boyfriend even says i just need to “do more with my day” and “exercise” yet even with those things i still can’t sleep for two days on end. i’m beginning to lose it. it’s been weeks. how do i get out of this pit and when do i finally hit the bottom.
NotSignal	like, its 4:26 here, i wake up 7. when i accept i just wont sleep tonight and do something better with the time besides stay in bed thinking about everything just wishing i could get some sleep
NotSignal	I have made a Reddit account just to post this. I have recovered from a 6-month insomnia that was related to a depressive episode which happened to me last year. Currently, a friend of mine has troubles sleeping and I've compiled a letter in hope to help him, drawing from my personal experience. I realised I could share [this letter](https://ln2.sync.com/dl/9c595ffe0/zrdm4z6k-juvre26i-nksuhqd7-mfzptrzw) here and maybe someone else will find it helpful too.The letter also contains links to a few online resources which I've found to be very useful. I don't claim that my ways of overcoming insomnia, anxiety and depression are universal and will 100% work for you, but I really hope they will.It's a two-page read, that's why I decided to upload a PDF, rather than posting the whole text here. It's written in a casual manner, so excuse me for any typos or grammar. If you follow the link it might take a few moments for the text to load, but if you have troubles loading it, let me know.
Signal	Does anyone have experience taking zopiclone? I have left over pills from traveling to the UAE last year that was prescribed for jet lag, and ended up forgetting to pack it.I want to take it tonight so I can get some sleep, but I had half tall can of beer and smoked some pot. I drank about 2 hours ago, and only had like 2 puffs of a joint. I feel totally fine. I just don’t really like taking medications because I have anxiety about it, so I just wanna know if it’s okay if I take the pill. They’re 7.5mg, I’d just take half of one. I’ll be able to get a full nights sleep. If I don’t take it I will probably fall asleep at 6am and wake up at 3pm... thoughts ??
NotSignal	I have hypnopompic hallucinations.Basically, I wake up from sleep, and have visual and auditory hallucinations that last anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes. I’m not sleeping when it happens, and it’s not a dream or sleep walking, I’m wide awake, completely aware and cognizant of my surroundings and actions, while also experiencing vivid hallucinations.I’ve had this since I was born, so I’m used to it, and on most nights, I will experience this once or twice, but it no longer bothers me and I can go back to sleep, sometimes even while the hallucinations are still happening.I also go through periods that last anywhere from a few days to a few months, where these hallucinations are more intense, and within minutes of me falling asleep, I’m waking up having them.I’m currently in the third week of one of these intense periods.I’ve learned to function well without much sleep, but I’m causing stress on my family with them. My hallucinations have involved seeing people and things coming into my house to hurt my wife and daughter, and it’s difficult to convince myself what I’m seeing isn’t real, so I’ve been waking them up trying to “protect them”.I’ve moved downstairs to the couch for sleeping, where I won’t bother them as frequently.I’ve seen doctors, neurologists, and have had sleep studies for this, but none of them have ever had any idea what is happening to me and have been unable to help. I’ve taken anti-depressants for this, and they did stop the hallucinations for the most part, but they also changed my personality. I’m generally a laid back and happy person, but the anti-depressants made me easily irritable, and even outright mean to people for no reason, so I stopped taking them.I want to try finding a treatment for this again. If anyone else experiences this, and wouldn’t mind commenting here or messaging me directly, please do.
NotSignal	i had just woken up from my alarm going off. i decided, "oh, i have some time left...i'll sleep for another hour." queue me trying to fall back asleep, vision going dark and spotty. i couldn't move. and then i heard the most annoying fucking moan like the boys in high school did. super feminine and hentai like. i laid there, so fucking confused. what the fuck.
Signal	I haven't been able to fall asleep for over a year now. I will lay in bed and just won't be able to fall asleep. If I do finally fall asleep I'll wake up a few hours later and yet again not be able to sleep. This all started when I threw out my old pillow and got a new one. The new one was highly uncomfortable resulting in tossing and turning all night. I've tried many pillows and feel they are either too high or too low. Im a side sleeper trying to transition into back sleeping as I have TMJ.I've tried associating my bed with only sleeping, using blue light filters on gadgets, breathing, drinking warm milk/eating turkey, taking melatonin(this worked the first time but now it does nothing for me), exercising, drinking water, stretching which are all done more than 3 hrs before bedtime.I still suffer from neck and upper back pain from poor posture which makes getting comfortable during sleep difficult. Any pillow recommendations? I remember before all this I use to be able to easily sleep and stay asleep for more than 10 hrs. I'm looking for any suggestions.
Signal	So I’ve been dealing with severe insomnia for two years now and well this is the worse it’s ever been. Last week I was awake for four days straight and didn’t sleep till Saturday early morning. And now this week I’ve been awake for two days am worried I won’t sleep till later this week. Any suggestions or ideas on how to sleep? I’ve tried melatonin and sleeping medicine prescribed and unprescribed and CBD stuff also.
NotSignal	I hate this lifestyle and I want it to change so badly. I tried pulling an all-nighter from Sunday so I could sleep Monday night. And I could NOT! Such annoyance. so I had to stay up- again! until 1PM today(Tuesday)! And I fell asleep until 5PM. Now I know the cycle is just gonna continue itself and I won’t sleep until 10Am and will not be able to get up and concentrate on my online classes and assignments! I just want to be normal.
Signal	I’m an extremely anxious and frightened person and my sleep problems have been getting worse this year. 3 years ago I was dependent on otc sleeping meds to sleep until one day after not sleeping for a day I took them and began to have a panic attack which landed me in the er. It was a scary, and frankly, traumatizing experience that has affected all facets of life. I can hardly take painkillers because I’m scared that same thing is going to happen again, and sleeping meds even melatonin are out of the question. I’m prescribed ambien but I can’t take it because it scares me. Currently I take 1mg of ativan (the only med that doesn’t frighten me) twice a day but it feels like I need more. It used to help me sleep so it was comforting to know I had a last resort, if that makes sense. I associate poor sleep with that day and so when I do sleep poorly, I begin to panic which leads to... less sleep. This wasn’t a huge issue until this year and now I sleep maybe 3 hours a night if I’m lucky. I don’t know how else to drive home the fact that I am extremely anxious and have bad ocd. Meditation even freaked me out. I feel worse as the days go by and my sleep doesn’t improve. I’m constantly tired and scared of losing my mind over this. Also I have pmdd and it’s the week before my period which always exacerbates my symptoms. I’m suffering. If anyone can relate to any of this, please tell me how you cope
Signal	I find sometimes I embrace my insomnia, ride it out untill 3-4pm the next day, take some medication then have a beautiful sleep (10-14hrs) is this bad / dangerous every now and then ? Like strategically doing it if I have a uni assignment to do etc ? Thoughts?
Signal	Even before the pandemic no one really helped me. I've gone to hospitals during times of not sleeping for like a month or two. It keeps happening every now and again and I have like PTSD or something from the last time. I've been like this for like a year or more maybe. Right now I haven't been really sleeping for the past couple of days. I was supposed to get a sleep study at the clinic last month but because of the pandemic it got canceleld. Had an in home sleep study, did it twice and they said I don't have sleep apnea. What am I gonna do? Am I gonna have to rely on benadryl or Ativan forever. I've had days where I've sleep without meds. I really need to invest in black out curtains. I also can't sleep without my light on due to past events that have happened. No one really wants to help me. Even when I have gone to ER's they have said they can only give me benadryl. This sucks. I hope I don't die from this. I want to live and have energy and not be so miserable.
NotSignal	So yesterday i woke up around 1 pm and i had a 5 hour drive home, when i got home i didn’t sleep and then i had to take care of a drunk friend all night. My room was insanely hot and i am sunburnt from my trip i was on so i’ve been really itchy. I finally went to bed around 11 am and i feel like i’m high or drunk or intoxicated but i haven’t had anything to do so. What is going on?
NotSignal	I started getting progressively worse sleep since last month ,I used to always wake up at 3 am and sometimes not sleep for a whole day.i haven't slept for two days sometimes even.i don't really stress in bed I just can't sleep/wake up too early.its caused by stress but the stressor is mostly gone so how can I balance out my insomnia? I go to bed at 9pm and it helps me fall asleep but stayin asleep is the issue.i also have low stomach acid so could it be zinc depletion?
NotSignal	I've been meditating and trying to practice mindfulness and it helps bc I've always been someone whose mind wanders wayyy too much while I'm trying to sleep. And then I try to stop it from wandering and then I try to to stop myself from forcing it. It's a brutal cycle. I haven't yet perfected the act of falling asleep easily, no but I do believe it has helped. Use an app for starters, there are tons of them out there.
Signal	I got about 30 minutes to an hour of sleep last night.. I also missed Thanksgiving and Christmas this year all due to lack of sleep.. it’s getting to the point where I can’t take it anymore. The reason I don’t show up to family get togethers is because I get extremely shaky and extremely nauseous when I don’t sleep. I would rather not show up then puke all of the table. (Which no doubt would happen) I’ve been to doctors and have prescriptions but nothing seems to work. I’m so tired but when I lay in bed or on the couch or even sometimes on the floor I just stare at the ceiling. All I want is to be able to sleep like a normal person. This is literally killing my family relationships. Sorry to rant I’m just pissed..
Signal	I don't fall asleep unless my body is physically exhausted. Even in my teenage years i recall getting maybe 3/4 hours sleep a night. Sometimes I feel my mind is too alert, so I focus on something to pass time until I can't stand being awake anymore. Last year however I was working 2 jobs (day job and night job) with maybe 1 day off a week, I would get maybe an hours rest a day until that day off where i would sleep for a full day. This took quite a toll on me and I acquired quite a sleep debt and have been struggling with depression since. Now in the present I am awake for most of the day and often I'm awake for 2 days until I'm totally lethargic. I do consume quite an excessive amount of caffeine but I do so as I feel tired as soon as I wake up however this just furthers the issue. Is this a result of poor sleeping habits and general health or have i been struggling with insomnia? I'm not exactly sure. I'm looking for any kind of hints and tips if possible also!
Signal	Hi guys. My insomnia has been God awful for about a year now. In the past I have had to be on Ambien, but even then I would sometimes spend two hours just wacked out on it before finally succumbing to exhaustion at 4:30AM. I also had some disturbing patterns of waking up not in my bed, and finding evidence of strange activities that I did while asleep and had absolutely no recollection of, which you can’t quite appreciate for how unsettling it is until it happens to you. I was also on Trazodone briefly, but it gave me really creepy vivid dreams that would wake me up because I already felt awake in them. That’s the only way I can explain it, but it felt like those scenes in movies where something seems like it’s happening in real time and then the person is startled awake in a sweaty panic. The side effects of both of these meds were extremely upsetting, so I chose to discontinue medication and eventually found some relief self medicating at night with marijuana. Unfortunately, weed started making me anxious about two years ago, so I don’t partake much anymore unless I can get a very specific Indica-heavy strain, which you just really can’t do when you buy weed from dudes with neck tattoos.I really don’t want to go back on prescription sleep aids, but I’m reaching the end of my rope, as my general quality of life is suffering. Still, I’m trying to do everything I can to improve my chances of getting sleep without medication. Can anyone recommend a really, really good pillow? When I get in the place of being worried and then frustrated about being unable to sleep, any perceived discomfort is magnified by a thousand and then becomes a major obstacle. My pillow is just not that great, so I’m looking to invest in something quality. I will pay hundreds if it will help. I do NOT want memory foam or anything that resembles it. I find these materials generally uncomfortable and hot, and I dislike the sensation of lying on them. I also like firm support.What kind of pillow would I get if I stayed at a luxury hotel?Thanks in advance!
NotSignal	I started this year with nights with little to no sleep. The last week I have been kinda recovering from it and I started having like 6 hours of sleep. But the last few days my nights were really weird. Every time I had the feeling that I had been lying awake for like 3 hours, and that it was 1 AM or something. Then I looked at my alarm clock to see how late it is and suddenly it's 7 AM. So even though I thought I hadn't slept, I apparently did, because there is no way that I had been awake for so long, because it felt like 3 hours. My mother and sister were already awake (because of school and work) but I hadn't even heard them. And I felt conscious all the time, but I could recall some dreams.
NotSignal	Found out I have pretty severe allergies today. Itchy nose, runny nose, congestion, sneezing.. guess who isn’t sleeping tonight? Does anyone know of any good OTC meds for allergies? I tried Zyrtec but it isn’t working all that well. Or is it something that has to be taken daily to be effective?
NotSignal	Say we manage to achieve normal sleep, most likely with CBTi. Does that mean that we have to sleep and wake up the same time for the rest of our lives? What about unexpected events, flights, roadtrips, walks, a nice movie, wanting to read/study, being human?? Sorry for the rant, but I'm new here and I'm trying to cope with the fact that insomnia will always be lurking, even if you manage to treat it well
Signal	I feel trapped every day by insomnia. I have to set about 10 alarms just to get out of bed and drag myself to work after a poor night’s sleep. At work, I chug coffee trying force myself to stay awake and focused. By lunch time, i feel a little better but starting at around 2 pm I start getting tired and it goes downhill fast. By the time I head home I’m craving for a bed to sleep in. But I get home, eat dinner, talk with my family and then I slowly start gaining energy again. I might watch an episode of my favorite show or browse through social media. Before I know it, it’s already midnight. I try to go to bed but keep tossing and turning. I dread looking at the time while laying in bed but I take a peak and see it’s already past 1 am. Eventually I fall asleep just after 2 am only to be awoken a few hours later by my 10 alarms ready to do it all again. I just don’t know how to break this vicious cycle.
NotSignal	I guess it’s just anxiety cause I went to the doc and he said so, and I’m only 21 so why would I have heart disease? But at the same time it feels like my heart is fluttering and every time I’m about to fall asleep I wake up gasping for air. Also I get this pain in my left hand. I read that pain in your left arm is a sign of heart failure so that doesn’t make me feel better either.
Signal	I’m an overthinking person, i have EXTREME anxiety, i’m so fucked up about my sleep that i think i will die from it, i stayed up for 20 hours, i know it sounds stupid and a bit drama, but i have exteme anxiety and i’m diagnosed with it, and i have couple of mental issues, like depression and extreme overthinking, i have been like this for like month and a half, waking up thinking “am i gonna sleep good tonight, it will kill me” it got soo bad that one time i was so messed up with thinking that i lost my mind, I started screaming and laughing hysterically, i hate this and I’m miserable, pls any tips, or anything to make me calm down.
NotSignal	Hi guys, I've always struggled with sleeping. I will offer you some tips that have worked for me:1) Do a hard workout 4-5 hours before your target sleep time.2) Use a sleep mask.3) Listen to a true crime doc as you try to fall asleep, you will find the material will help you relax.4) Use melatonin, but less than 1mg, otherwise you will feel groggy the next day.Hope that helps, enjoy.
NotSignal	It’s 2 am and I have officially been awake for 21 hours and I feel like shit. My mind feels like it’s airy and any lick of sleepiness I get, my mind begins to race and wakes me back up. I’ve been struggling with sleep the past 5 nights and god it’s taking a toll on me.I can’t stop crying because of the lack of sleep and I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m so fucking tired all I want is just 9 hours of sleep right now. I usually go to bed at 9 pm but for some reason I just can’t. I don’t know if it’s the time change or just stress from but I just can’t do this. I work every weekend and I have to be up at 5:30am and this weekend fucking killed me. I don’t know how people can run on 4 hours of sleep and I don’t know how I did it either. I’m jealous of those who are fast asleep in their beds getting their full 8 hours and for those who aren’t, I feel ya. I hope this shit goes away soon so I can feel like me again. I hope this doesn’t last any more nights.
Signal	I’ve been dealing with symptoms of insomnia since about middle school, and seven years later it’s only getting worse. I’ve never tried OTC sleeping aids before, but lately I’ve been taking two pills of generic diphenhydramine (anti-histamine and sedative, pretty much Benadryl) every night. I wake up drowsy as hell, but I’ve been going to sleep around 11p or 12a instead of 4a. The worst part is how drowsy I feel when I wake up completely. I also wake up every hour or so once it hits 3 and I’m guessing it’s because the pill is wearing off.Is it unhealthy to rely on this? Should I seek out a prescription that doesn’t make me so drowsy? I’ve tried melatonin and valerian root but they don’t work for me. Thanks y’all :)
NotSignal	Due to the pandemic I’ve been smoking a lot more cuz I dont do shit but stay home (besides my job but I only work 4 days out of the week). It really helps with my stress. I havent smoked in about 24 hours because my job drug tests in a couple days so I’m trying to stay clean for a bit until then. I had a busy day, ran some errands for my mom and my stress took over around noon. I had a panic attack in my car and just cried it out until I felt a little better. Its night and I been scrolling on reddit for 4 hours endlessly and I realized that I dont feel sleepy. At all, and I was up early. I’m usually lights out by midnight and sleeping like a baby cuz I’m high af. Its almost 3am and I literally cant sleep, I’ve tried. My mind keeps going non stop. Just wanted to share to let someone else know, who might be going through the same, that I’m right there with you. Hope it means something to someone because it would to me.
Signal	Just had my first session with a neuropsy specializing in insomnia and tinnitus. Diagnosis of sleep maintenance issues rather than sleep initiation, so things like melatonin and sleep restriction won’t be helpful. Prescribed Remeron and said that lyrica is useful in her experience too. Anyone with positive effects for sleep maintenance with Remeron?
Signal	Common theme. I'm prescribed an SSRI and it helps perk me up a bit. But at night time sleep is not happening. Every SSRI, every time... and then I'm given ambien and all the other sleep aids and sedatives and nope. Still wide awake all night. Passing me off. Amitriptyline helped in the past, built up a tolerance and gained weight had to stop. Is this common?What's the heaviest sedative?Thanks,33F bipo1 diagnosed 1 year ago this week. Xanax 1mg have tried up to 4. (And mixing with ambien)Ambien 10... have tried up to 30Lexapro 5mgPs don't waste your time with that otc sleep aid "candy"
Signal	Suffering from chronic insomnia and weak sleep is their a fix for it ? I have sleeping pills before but they make me groggy when I wake up and sometimes don't work and I still wake up at night . The chronic insomnia usually happens when my sleeping schedule changes but sometimes it doesn't go away it is a bit effecting my sleep. Can I take abit of amphetamines for the lack of concentration as the now chronic insomnia is effecting my concentration in the morning
Signal	Ive been experiencing insomnia issues since early September. I took one 120mg pill of mdma whereas my friends took 6 within two nights without any repercussions. Im not sure why this happened to me when i did the recommended dose & i even supplemented to mitigate any potential damage. Kind of bullshit this has happened but i need some help to figure out how to get my sleep back. Its slowly taking a toll on me.I already excercise & eat healthy so stuff like that wont be any help.
Signal	I've always had trouble sleeping for long periods of time. But I wish I could sleep up to 7 or 6 and a half at least but all I am doing is sleeping until 2am. I fall to sleep just fine but only can sleep 5 hours straight then I'm awake and the mind starts going. It's particularly worse at the moment because I upped sertraline to 150mg. Anyone got any tips? I fall asleep about 9.45pm-10.30pm. I try to avoid having naps in the evening but if I'm exhausted then I will have a nap around 5 when I get home from work.
Signal	Hi, I'm a 19 male kid who for the love of god cannot sleep no matter what the hell I do.Last night, I slept for no more than 3 hours, and fighting my own way through the day trying to finally get my sleep schedule back to function, I've now been up for over 20 hours and it's LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE for me to get some sleep and it's tearing me apart, mentally.It would start like this, I get extremely tired, so much so that I'm almost passing out, then the fuck out of nowhere I get a very short lived anxiety attack and burst wide awake again, repeat this process 18 times now and here I am, 3 AM, and texting to whoevers out there cause right now I genuinely feel like I'm going mad. I need help. Badly. And I have no idea how to fix it, I've taken some sleep medication and it does jack. I've been using the 'fall asleep breathing method' for almost over an hour with no effect, and still here I am, praying to whatever God is out there who can help me. I'm begging you, if any one of you know what's wrong with me I would be very grateful, very very grateful.For the last few months it started out as a small side problem but now it has evolved to something really really fucking bad for me, I've had depression and anxiety for almost half a year and I can feel it hitting coming back hitting me like a brick wall. I've tried everything and I'm feeling completely and utterly hopeless right now.What do I do?
NotSignal	just put earplugs in. totally silent aside from my pulsatile tinnitus. I am hell-bent on ending this tonight. No more mental breakdowns, no more meds, no more bullshit. This ends tonight.
Signal	Ah, I get at least one of these nights a week. My insomnia definitely isn't as severe as it used to be when lockdown first started. Hate these nights though, they spark that anxiety around sleep deprivation and health again for the day. I'm usually fine the next night. Haven't had a night completely without sleep since right at the end of May, but plenty of nights of 2-3 hours. Hoping that tonight's not a night without sleep. I don't want to go back to that dark place again. I'm 14 by the way and I do worry a lot. Any fellow insomniacs awake now? School in less than a week for me. Maybe normality will hit and rid me of this. Or maybe it'll just create more anxiety about not being able to function.... only time will tell.
Signal	F (21) started taking Clonazepam (Rivotril) for sleep 3 weeks ago, I started taking 1mg at night but started waking up 4 hours after taking it, then I started taking 2mg and it is still happening. I am really frustrated at this point, my next appointment with my psychiatrist is next Friday. I started taking this because I have sleeping problems since I have 16 years old, but this is the first time that I started to have anxiety attacks and because of that I searched for medical help. I know I have to wait but what this happens? I think the effect of the pill is not working right on me and really stress me out
Signal	Took 1.5mg klonopin, 0.5mg xanax, whiskey, 150mg lyrica and 10mg cyprexa. Still cant sleep. I can barely live like this anymore. Id be nice if someone wants to chat.. the loneliness on top of this is killing me rn..
NotSignal	Anyone experience issues waking up every two hours but being able to go right back to sleep within 2-5 minutes?I know it's not exactly insomnia but figured I would ask.
NotSignal	I haven’t been able to sleep more than two hours past month. I have to move out in a week. I’ll be up awake in bed until like 5 or 6am. I won’t even be visibly or consciously worrying about anything but I have a feeling that can be why I can’t sleep good at all. Also worried about damaging my body by not sleeping and it scares me too. I try to tell myself I will be okay and to just relax in bed but it’s hard.
Signal	I've had insomnia for as long as I can remember, ever since childhood.. But my insomnia doesn't prevent me from actually sleeping.. Here is how it usually goes..Bed 12:30am > Wake up at 2:30am till 3:30am > Sleep till 5:30am, start the day..Ofcourse this is just the average times.. And it has caused me heap of problems, feeling bitterness, hopeless, depressed... Which is seeping out into my personal life no matter how hard I'm trying to contain it.
NotSignal	Should I not think at all? Should I count sheep? Where should my eyes be pointing? WTF is optimal?
NotSignal	One thing I've seemed to notice about my bouts of insomnia is that they coincide the times that I am least active/productive. Like school/university holidays, or quarantines. Lately I've had low cognitive/social engagement and my sleep is worst it's been in a long time. Going outside casually for sunlight hasn't helped. It's like there's not a large enough difference between day:on and night:off for my brain to fall asleep.Does anyone else have similar experiences?
NotSignal	I’m about to pull a 36 hour stay up to adjust my sleep cycle...again. I’m a completely different person when I wake up in the afternoon. This is just so hard. Just looking for support and tips. Really self loathing right now and dreading the next day and a half :’(
Signal	It's so bad I'm trying to do my part to turn around my life but years of not sleeping is kicking my ass I'll.lay down for 7 hours with my eyes closed or I'll sleep for a solid 3 and a half to four hours and wake up to immediately being wide awake and unable to sleep I just want fucking sleep please
Signal	This is the fourth night in a row when I can’t fall asleep until 3-6 am. When I fall asleep in those hours I wake up at 2 in the afternoon. Luckily, with my university doing online classes because of covid-19, I don’t have to worry about missing classes because of it. My usual OTC sleep aids aren’t working. Benedryl, Advil pm, and melatonin have all stopped. I am not diagnosed with insomnia so I am not medicated for it. I already have three medications I take and don’t want to add anymore to the list. I take 70 mg of Vyvanse for my ADD (attention deficit disorder, like ADHD without the hyperactivity), Wellbutrin for depression, and my birth control pills. Since I wake up late In the afternoon due to lack of sleep at night I take my Vyvanse late in the day. I think that might be doing it. I don’t smoke marijuana because it is illegal in my state but my boyfriend smokes it on a daily basis. I don’t drink a lot. Any advice? Because it’s gotten to the point where I’m crying out of frustration of not being able to sleep. Thank you for reading, I just had to vent.
Signal	In the last two weeks I’ve been up till 3, trying everything in my power to fall asleep. I started to take Benadryl and that worked until tonight. It’s 2 am and I’m wide awake. I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not thinking about anything nor has my routine changed. I’m at a loss. I’m extremely fristyand tonight I started crying because I can’t fall asleep. All I want is to knock out and nothing is working.
Signal	hi folks - just recently was diagnosed with insomnia and sleep apnea (honestly didn't realize for the last 20+ years that it's not normal to always take 2-4 hours to fall asleep at night...)My health insurance won't pay for a sleep study because as they worded it "your records show that you do not have insomnia or daytime sleepiness, so a study is not medically necessary", despite a sleep specialist doctor submitting the pre-auth to them with her diagnosis.Anyway, I have been wearing a Samsung Galaxy Fit 2 for about 4 months now every night, and just over two weeks also an oximeter because initially docs thought it might be OSA, but turns out my breathing is generally just fine.To the point though - now that i have some proof that it always takes 2-4 hours for me to first fall asleep at night and that I'm waking up 10+ times per hour, I'd like to set up a camera to watch/hear my 'sleep' but am not sure what would be a good unit for this.Could you guys suggest a good cheapish camera that can see in the dark that I can have streaming to my PC in another room, as well as the software to run it?Many thanks in advance.
NotSignal	Preface: I've been an insomniac for 40 some-odd years of my life. I've tried sleep aids, I've tried melatonin, and none of them have really worked for me. Melatonin actually gave me an allergic reaction at higher doses. Weed is nice, but it's not my lifestyle, and I can't risk getting flagged in a drug test.Enter the cheese. Although not being a lactose-free person, I have for decades not eaten cheese on any sort of regular basis. If I did have cheese it was most commonly a pre-sliced cheese (which I have recently noticed I had been purchasing is very processed with lots of added ingredients).For some reason during the pandemic, I started to take an interest in and began eating more cheese as a snack (as well as paying more attention to the ingredient labels). I first switched to more expensive "real" cheese slices and decided to go to block cheese as a cost-cutter. My switch to real cheese (essentially 3 ingredients) probably started 4 months after my uptick in cheese eatingSince shortly after starting eating whole real cheese on a daily basis, I have entered into a "normal sleeping pattern". I'm still drinking just as much coffee as I normally do, also sugar, ice cream, etc. My normal diet is otherwise unaffected by the introduction of natural cheese (about a half-inch worth of a standard supermarket block, per day).I am now falling asleep at a respectable early evening hour. I'm getting tired on my own and my body is allowing me to actually just lay down and sleep instead of fighting me with mental alertness. I'm also getting up easier, on my own, before my alarm is going off.I don't understand it, I don't get it, but I'm telling you my story because I wish someone had told me to try this 30 years ago instead of me just stumbling on this on my own.I know this all probably sounds stupid, but if it can help one other person out there that has suffered life-long insomnia, it will be worth it to look the fool on the internet.
Signal	Hi everyone suffering from insomnia. I feel myself near-recovered from it now and I would like to share the method that worked for me. Chronic insomnia, which is not caused my underlying medical condition, is pretty an anxiety disorder, when worries about sleep prevent sleep. While, CBTI is a major go-to non-pharmacological intervention, I found that Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT), which is described in the Guy Meadows' The Sleep book worked best for me. The method relies of mindfulness, that will help you to understand what is it that prevents you from falling asleep/staying asleep. For many it may be anxious feelings, fast beating heart, frustration and other unpleasant reactions associated with bed time. After most of my anxiety have subsided, I still didn't sleep well. Mindfulness helped to understand that I was putting too much of the mental effort to fall asleep, I was actively trying to fall asleep, trying too hard, which literally was keeping me awake all night long. Below I provide some of my ACT experience, which I hope will be helpful to someone. After reading the Sleep book many times and reflecting on things I missed and after experimenting with sleep, I can tell you that book should be just taken literally and it has all the tools you need. The essence of the book is pretty much summarized in these few pieces:1. “The effort I was putting in to sleep had not worked and then it hit me: perhaps I was trying too hard. I rewound to when I slept well to figure out what I was doing. How did I do it? Really I did nothing special at all. The only thing I did to sleep was close my eyes”2. “Any attempts to fight, avoid, change or get rid of experiencing your insomnia tell your brain that you are being threatened, triggering your innate survival response. In this moment you become mentally and physically alert as your brain prepares you to stand and fight or withdraw in flight.”3. “The most important thing to note about a normal sleeper is their willingness to relax and be quietly wakeful in the presleep phase. They aren’t trying to force sleep upon themselves”4. “Here you accept the fact that you are awake and are willing to ‘watch’ and ‘welcome’ any of your wanted or unwanted thoughts, memories, images or sensations that arise in your mind and body moment by moment. You take the position of a peaceful bystander who watches over your internal world without judgment or comment.”5. “When you can let go of the idea that you need to be asleep, then you remove the obstacles in the way of falling to sleep.”Some people (not me) are likely naturally more mindful than others and can figure out ‘do nothing’ thing even without ACT. For instance, these are two recommendations from people which mostly relied on CBTI rules for recover sleep: “When I feel ready, I make my mind go blank as if I’m meditating …. If you’re thinking about your mind being blank, you’re still thinking too much and you’re not relaxed”; “Most importantly, don’t force yourself to sleep, dont put any effort into it, when you sleep just do nothing, think of nothing and you will sleep”So it goes down to do nothing and think about nothing. Yet, it is so easy to overdo this! (many, many exclamation marks). That was my major roadblock. Without realizing it, I was gently trying to suppress thinking (so called self-monitoring). I thought I was doing nothing and yet didn’t sleep. I was afraid that I am broken now, and yet I was simply doing too much.So I was putting too much mental effort into falling asleep without realizing it. And that’s where mindfulness helps. Mindfulness is useful in two ways: First, mindful meditation will remind you what it’s like to just be, to just be present. Second, it provides the best terminology to understand pre-sleep phase. First, about doing nothing. If you ever did mindful meditation after bad night, you might have noticed that you become sleepy during meditation. In my opinion, the reason is thatyou are not striving for anything during meditation. You are just being present, willing to feel and experience sensations of your body and thoughts in your mind. You don’t set goals for your mind to achieve something and if sleepy, your mind will tend to drift off. I find my pre-sleep state now to be very similar to meditation and it consistently sends me into sleep at night. Yet, don’t meditate to fall asleep! Meditation experience should give you an idea what it is like to just be. Then, when you are in your bed, just close your eyes and just be! Just be there, in you body, in you mind. Just realize that you are here, you are human being, suffering from insomnia, you are alive, you are present, you are awake and you choose to do nothing about it. Don’t distract yourself intentionally with pleasant thoughts and yet don’t try to suppress thoughts either. If you mind wanders off, you might fall asleep while being in a random thought (which you didn’t force yourself into). If you realize that your mind has wandered off and you are not sleeping yet, just return to the state of being present. Yet, it is not meditation. Don’t do intentional body scans and active thought watching. Just be there, whole, human, alive, awake. MOST IMPORTANTLY, focus on REST. Imagine, that you know for sure, that you are not going to sleep tonight, whatever you do, however hard you try. So the best you can do in that case is just get yourself comfortable, lie still and focus on rest, and just rest and be awake. Do not trying to force yourself into sleep, that will only make sleep harder. Just aim for calm wakeful rest. Of course you are here to sleep, don't lie to yourself, don't self talk that you don't care about sleep, that will make sleep harder. But make a mindful choice not to do anything about being awake and just be there and rest. As Guy Meadows puts it: “Here you accept the fact that you are awake and are willing to ‘watch’ and ‘welcome’ any of your wanted or unwanted thoughts, memories, images or sensations that arise in your mind and body moment by moment. You take the position of a peaceful bystander who watches over your internal world without judgment or comment.”Second, mindfulness provides great terminology. If someone just tells you: close your eyes and don’t think about anything to fall asleep, they will be absolutely correct. Yet, if a person with insomnia will try not to think about anything, he/she will be trying to suppress thinking altogether and force sleep. ACT reminds us what it is like to not think about anything: be willing to stay awake and just allow your mind to bring you random thoughts. Don’t worry about these thoughts. After all you may drift to sleep while being caught in a random thought. If you are still awake after realizing you were in the thought, return to just being awake and just being present without striving to achieve your goal.Recovery is a process and for most people is not an overnight switch. Be prepared for bad nights, while you are figuring out 'do nothing' thing. After you figure it out, be prepared for setbacks and relapses. They will come, and when they come, just do nothing about them.I hope this post will be helpful for someone. ACT is a great and gentle treatment to recover natural sleep and I highly recommend to everyone, especially if CBTI fuels even more anxiety in you (like it did in me. I failed desperately few times with sleep restriction).
NotSignal	It's been almost 3 days of literaly zero hours of sleep, and last time I slept it was for approximately 3 hours, I've been able to keep going because I don't really expend energy with the quarantine. I don't consume anything that keeps me awake. Maybe it's just my depression, idk. I just ponder how worthless everything is with the time I have at night. My "days" consist mostly of waiting for the next day. And I can't really keep track of time. I also don't eat much.Idk wtf is wrong with me. I just exsist day in, day out.
NotSignal	I have to be up at 8:30 for a job interview and it is 4:54 am. I usually can sleep for two or three hours around 7. I’m so worried if I do fall asleep, I’ll sleep through my alarm and disappoint everyone. I hate this so much :(
NotSignal	Wish me luck everyone starting first shift tomorrow for couple weeks to help out job, have trouble sleeping and currently looking at 4-6hrs if I’m able to sleep! Goodnight everyone
Signal	and my body is tired but my brain just doesn't shut up. And its always stupid things, or my current musical earworm on repeat. Psychiatrist has me on quetiapine for its sedative side effects to keep me out once I'm under, but its just not working anymore. I wake up at the drop of a hat. I've tried changing my environment, I normally swear by eye masks... I wish my health team would be more willing to prescribe actual sleeping pills, but of course, Ontario has narcotics issues, and I'm not going to let them fuck ws now that I'm on a dose that's working.ith my antidepressantDoesn't I'm generally too low income to make other options work. Can't stand the taste/smell of alcohol anyways, smoking weed when you have breathing issues is dumb (even if I do live half an hour from the Mohawk red and the low prices there).IDK, I think I just needed to bitch about my intermittent insomnia while I sit here in the dark watching disaster movies.
Signal	It's usually around 7:00. People who have gotten a good night's rest are getting ready for their jobs and lives. There's this guy who revs his motorcycle every morning at exactly 6:50. The sun is usually just starting to make the clouds kind of transparent. Everything is a blue-gray. This is usually when I give up sleeping.Yesterday I called out from work and tried to sleep. All that happened was I felt guilty and like a stupid piece of worthless shit all day, evening, and all night long. I laid here, yet again, sweating and tossing and turning and telling myself, stop thinking. Nothing matters right now. Nothing can be taken care of right now. You need rest. But still, those thoughts happen before I can even realize it. My brain is just firing off electricity left and right and all I want is to...sleep.My shift starts in an hour and 10 minutes. I'm feeling hopeless and alone and exhausted. I just needed somewhere to put this so it's not in my head anymore.
NotSignal	I only just started taking it but i honestly have never felt so awake during the day! It's hard waking up though in the morning but with some workout and coffee that goes away pretty fast.I finally dream a bit too now.It also really makes me kinda feel more calm during the day and less stressed, i have exams now and can actually focus and remember stuff more clearly.Just wanted to share my (short tho) experience with thisWhat do you all have of experience with trazodone?
Signal	Now I know some people like to say if you don't have a diagnosis, don't say you have it. But I am a rising senior in high school with a couple Psychology classes already under my belt. I know I've had depression for years, and due to my family life some moderate PTSD. Since about middle school I've had issues with falling and staying asleep, sometimes getting as little to 3-4 hours on school nights if any, and even less on any other nights. It usually comes and goes along with stress, but lately over the past year or so it's been getting worse and more consistent. The past three nights my partner and I were trying to go to sleep and I just could not get comfortable, and couldn't get any sleep. I didn't get a wink until past 5 or 6 each of those nights. I've taken some OTC sleeping pills and those help some, but if I manage to stay up past the initial drowsiness I can't get to sleep to save my life. I don't have the resources to get medicine or an appointment at this time, so I don't know what to do. Any advice would be helpful
Signal	The past 2 nights I actually took full 3mg doses of melatonin before bedtime and I genuinely can’t remember the last time I slept so well!Usually, I can’t fall asleep until like 3am, I wake up throughout the night, I can’t get comfortable and usually have a headache, and I’m exhausted through the entire day, passing out whenever possible. With the melatonin, I was able to fall asleep almost instantly, I stayed asleep all night (only waking once for a moment the second night), I woke up without any headache, and even though I’m hella groggy in the mornings, I don’t feel exhausted all day for seemingly no reason.
NotSignal	Greetings.I've tried 5 different meds and nothing seems to work (apart from benzodiazepines, but I don't want to continue taking them for obvious reasons). Weed, however, is a wonder drug, the only thing that really helps me sleep and feel more or less rested the next day.However, I also don't want to get high every single night. Can peopled who also react well to marijuana share what other things have been helpful for them?
NotSignal	I never thought that I would miss sleeping in my dorm. I’ve been home since March and my sleep schedule is all outta wack (for many reasons). But one of the main reasons is I have developed some kind of home intruder fear?? After sleeping behind a lock dorm room, 5 other big doors that need ID to open, AND a security guard I got used to feeling “safe” I guess. Now that I’m home every noise scares me half to death and then I can’t get to bed for hours thinking someone’s in my house. I don’t even live in an area with high crime so my fears are definitely irrational. Not sure where the best place is to put this post! Sorry if this isn’t the right place!
Signal	It’s the Zoloft that’s keeping me awake I think, I can’t be bothered with it anymore, I’m still anxious, tired, and depressed. Any tips for just getting a long nights sleep, I always wake after like an hour or two, it’s the most fuckin frustrating thing in the world. I’m hoping it’s a side effect that’ll go away but in the mean time, any one tried cba or melatonin or? Just anything
Signal	Bags under my eyes keep getting heavier as these sleepless weeks pass by. It’s frustrating. I lay down every night after a full day of work, complete darkness, and I can’t sleep. I toss and turn for hours and hours. It’s starting to make my days longer and makes me much more agitated than normal.I just wish I could sleep.
Signal	I’ve been stressed for about a week now and all throughout I’ve had terrible sleep. I already know I have insomnia but the stress of moving is making barely able to sleep even with my sleeping pills. I’m not alone as my husband (who doesn’t have insomnia) hasn’t had a good nights rest in a week either. Once things settle down, I’m hoping my body and mind just shuts down into some much needed sleep as I am neck deep in sleep debt!!
NotSignal	I feel too anxious but exhausted at the same time so my body shuts down but i’m still conscious... it freaks me out
NotSignal	I don’t know how to express this but it’s quite strange. It’s like I never fall asleep but rather get stuck in a phase between wakefulness and sleep. I see dream-like stuff that I’m not able to control, but at the same time I am “kinda” aware of that I’m not sleeping and it’s more like a fantasy world; not full-blown dreams.. Something like half-consciousness.. I can’t explain how much tiring and mentally draining this is.. I wonder if any other folks suffering from insomnia experience something similar?
NotSignal	I keep struggling to sleep and waking up at 3 am. Does anyone have a guideline link of what rules I can follow to improve my sleeping??
NotSignal	so I’m a data scientist and with my partner who is a cognitive scientist we came up with a way that we think helps people fall asleep. It’s beta so can’t promise you the moon but if you are open to try it out in exchange for honest feedback we would love to give you access. We are currently opening it up to 30 people, first come first serve. Please reach out if you're interested.
NotSignal	You know that feeling when you finally get fed up with not being able to sleep so you just say “I’ll wake up now then.” I was awake for about 34 hours only to go to bed and get a couple hours of sleep. Pretty sure our bodies have a special type of caffeine that it pumps out while we sleep. That or it’s Satans work.
Signal	Thank you so much, “partner”It really makes it easier with you breathing down my neck.I’m sure to fall asleep when I not only feel the stress & pressure from my own self, but from YOU TOO!Yeah, that’s a tried and true method for insomniacs. Just ask them a million times what they are doing up and why they are to and yell at them for trying to find ways to occupy the mind instead of just staring at a black ceiling for hours.
Signal	I’m literally so sick of this now. I have to be up to travel to my mums in about 3 hours and I’ve just been laying awake since 1am despite feeling tired I just can’t fall asleep. Lately I’ve found that is the case until about 6am when I’ll start to fall asleep which would normally be fine but as I need to get up soon it seems pointless to sleep now. I have 4 alarms set on my phone but I’ve started turning my alarms off in my sleep or just completely ignoring them. I don’t want to spent my birthday half awake but I also don’t want to spend it waking up with half the day gone and my family being pissed at me for being late. I hate this I just want a break from it all.
NotSignal	hi i would like to introduce myself i have suffered with insomnia for about 4 year ever since i got diagnosed with anaemia. i think the night sweats i used to get when i had anaemia might have started it as ever since i have been lucky to get about 2 hour at a time
Signal	Have any of you guys used Remeron? I’m more so wondering how your sleep has been. Its been about two weeks now and I’ve slept great but at the same time feel like I’m always in a ‘dream state’ and therefore usually wake up confused and ‘drowsy’...
NotSignal	I know this isn't the standard (medical) advice for insomnia, but here it goes.So there were some nights I just knew I wasn't going to sleep. I would be wide awake and I found it difficult to be in my own head because of all the negative self talk, loneliness, and suicidal ideation (I have bipolar disorder).So I went over to r/kikpals and I found someone in a different time zone to talk to.And I lucked out! I found someone incredible to talk to. She's smart, funny, and a great conversationalist. She does way more for me then she'll ever know.But it does work well. I can be sleepless at 2 a.m., but she's going about her day as usual. Having someone to talk to instead of my own demons is a relief in and of itself.I know I shouldn't be on my phone if I'm trying to go to sleep, but how's going down the rabbit hole of negative self talk while I close my eyes much better?
Signal	I slept well for about a month. Falling asleep, waking up then going back to sleep until morning pretty easily. I even had ditched my sleep medication (Zopiclone). I was feeling pretty confident until about a week ago when insomnia came back. However, it’s a bit different than what it used to be. I have no troubles falling asleep initially but then I wake up at around 1-2 am and cannot go back to sleep. On some nights I caved in last week and took a Zopiclone pill. Not caving in tonight though. I’m so fucking mad. College starts next week, Let’s hope that It’ll get better by then.
Signal	Starting Seroquel today after trazodone didn’t do anything. Any advice?
NotSignal	FFS I don't know if it's the same person with multiple accounts and severe hypochondria or if WebMD has doomed humanity.
Signal	Hello. ever since early-2013, when I was 20/21 yrs old, I have been having bad sleep. in Feb. 2013, I noticed signs of not being able to fall asleep quickly. but I could still get refreshing quality sleep. in May 2013, my sleep all of a sudden went downhill. I sleep for 9 hours and i wake up feeling as if I slept only 2 or 3 hours. I also wake up a few hours in the early morning, every night for the past 7 years. like spontaneous early-morning awakenings. I never had this before my insomnia kicked in.in July 2013, on a random night, I slept normal. and after that my insomnia kicked back in and it's been like that for almost 7 years, 365 a year.in February 2014, my sleep quality went down a bit. it stayed that way for 5 years when in Jan. 2019 my sleep quality went down much further.my eyelids are now twitching all the time, and I am getting much lighter sleep relative to some years back when it first started. i have constant light headiness and blurry vision due to non-refreshing sleep.other info: in late 2012 I began abstaining from all sexual activity due to medical problems. and continue to this day. could constant sexual abstinence be related to my deteriorating sleep?also: I had my vitamin D levels checked in 2018. they were 21 ng/ml. I have been on D3 supplements for about a month [5000IU] and there is no change in my sleep quality. blood work for everything else is good.I have tried rigorous exercise and changes in diet. but to no avail.can anyone give me their theories on what is wrong with me? thanks.
Signal	Any insights would be very appreciated.I have had insomnia for 12 years. When I try to sleep at night I experience the following symptoms:1. Before bed, I will experience a rush of wakefulness that makes it impossible to sleep. It is almost like being injected with adrenaline.2. If I fall asleep, I will awaken after half an hour experiencing tremors or a mild seizure.3. After both experiences, I will often have restless legs.4. I cannot sleep unless my bladder is empty and I wake up every half an hour about three times to urinate until I feel there is nothing left.I do not understand whether it is psychological or biological. I had a total thyroidectomy due to cancer and take 175 mcg thyroxine. I am kept slightly hypothyroid.I have an anxiety disorder due to PTSD from childhood abuse. I have done a lot of work on this and relaxed almost all tension or stress. I do not rank high on anxiety tests.Does it sound biological or psychological?
NotSignal	Hey, Does anyone have experience with P.I? What does it mean if I think I haven’t slept, but I feel healthy throughout the following day? I remember being up throughout points of the night and partially remembering my thoughts. There is no way I was sleeping. I just don’t understand
Signal	My doctor prescribed lorazepam for short term. I don’t want to keep taking it and plus the more I use it the less it works. My problem is more anxiety than depression. I’m going through more stress right now so it’s adding to it. I have a hard time shutting my thoughts before bed. If an antidepressant helped you overcome insomnia, which one? And were the side effects bad?
NotSignal	BenzosBinge drinking Binging & purging This is a serious post. Ive had crippling insomnia for years. Currently completing PhD in chemical engr. Cannot function without sleep. The problem is I will stay awake for 36-48hrs, fall asleep for 2-4, then rinse and repeat unless something is done to knock out. Cannot take trazadone, Benadryl, or antidepressants due to brain fog. The above methods work best. They all have their obvious drawbacks:Have been physically addicted to benzos, went through withdrawals - cannot say that’s an experience I look forward to revisiting. Also blackouts. I’ve completed exams while having no memory of it, and left a note on a colleagues desk just the other day that I did not remember doing until I saw the note. This happens on “normal” doses - 0.5mg Xanax or 1mg klonipin taken nightly for a week or more. Binge drinking is causing premature aging, weight gain, blackouts, and obviously not good for the liver. Binging and purging was the method I used for the longest time and probably induced the best/deepest sleep but stopped bc teeth may possibly all need to be removed (trying to delay that as long as possible until I have a job). Pls lmk your thoughts and thank you.
NotSignal	Hello everybody! Does meditation work for insomnia? And if so, how long do you need to meditate daily? Any guided meditation recommendations? Thanks!
NotSignal	I did a sleep study where they said I had a 77% sleep efficiencyI was in bed for 435 minutes and total sleep time was 338 minutes. In stage 1, I was at 2.7 and 61.4% at stage 2. Stage III was 21% and REM was 14%I would like to be able to have a multiple day idea of how much I actually slept and was in REM. I don't know if that's possible in an affordable way or through healthcare.
NotSignal	I have insomnia since I was a kid, and I'm afraid of sleeping in the dark since then as well. I could never get through this fear, and I can only sleep in a dark room if someone is sleeping with me. My solution was sleeping with a light on, but it feels too bright and I can't fall asleep. So whenever I need to sleep alone, Im just there hours and hours trying to fall asleep with no success, because if I turn off the lights I get anxious and with panic attacks sometimes, but if I leave a light on my brain just can't get "tired" and ill be awake until sunrise. Any tips? Is there something I can do?
Signal	For the last week, I’ve been waking up after 3–4-5 hours of sleep and I’m unable to go back to sleep. During this period I feel my throat and mouth are dry and throat feels a little tight and uncomfortable. At the same time I’m having random thoughts, not even stress or anxiety, although it builds up to that sometimes. I use to sleep like a baby, even with taking caffeine an hour before or just in general. Can this be some underlying health issue or is this just a new onset of insomnia from underlying stress and anxiety?
NotSignal	I’m up at 3 am now. After having a nightmare and a racing heart @ 110bpm. So great another medication that didn’t work. I’m trying thc edibles next. I can’t do this shit anymore
Signal	I've had trouble sleeping for as long as I can remember, but it's been worse than normal lately. I work a physical job eight hours a day, by all rights I should be very tired when I get home, but I'm not. My brain is the loudest thing in the world and never stops. It's like someone cut the breaks to it and now it's just barreling down a metaphorical highway, weaving between lanes. Not only is my brain very loud, even though I feel how exhausted I am, I am still completely wired all the time. I don't know if it's anxiety but I've numbed myself to the sensation to the point where I can't tell whether or not I have it, or if it's just that I operate on some other kind of sleep cycle, but whatever it is, it's fucking annoying. When I don't work, and when I didn't work for long periods of time (months) I had less trouble (note: LESS, still wasn't normal) sleeping, but that was because I was able to be up for so long to a point where I just flat out passed out because staying awake because strenuous. It happened then that I would knock out for 12 hours straight, which of course only made me lethargic. That only happened once in a while though with weeks apart, and I would just go back to the normal maximum of 4 hours per night again. I am so tired of being tired. Tips would help if anyone has had a similar type of whatever the hell this is.
Signal	Sleep problems can be caused by various physical, medical, psychiatric, environmental factors. It is true that about half of the people over the age of 65 have some type of sleep disorder.Although causes might differ, the end result of all sleep disorders is that the body's natural cycle of slumber and daytime wakefulness is disrupted or exaggerated.&#x200B;Factors that can cause sleep problems are:* Physical (such as ulcers)* Medical (such as asthma)* Psychiatric (such as depression and anxiety disorders)* Environmental (such as alcohol)Long-term or chronic insomnia (insomnia that occurs at least three nights a week for a month or longer) can be caused by factors such as depression, chronic stress, and pain or discomfort at night. A common cause of chronic insomnia is a conditioned emotional response. Thoughts about the sleep problem (e.g., "What if I don’t fall asleep tonight?") and behaviors that develop around the sleep problem (e.g., sleeping in and napping, ruminating in bed) tend to maintain insomnia symptoms.Short-term or acute insomnia can be caused by life stresses (such as job loss or change, death of a loved one, or moving), an illness, or environmental factors such as light, noise, or extreme temperatures.&#x200B;**Other factors that can interfere with sleep:**Allergies and Respiratory ProblemsAllergies, colds, and upper respiratory infections can make it challenging to breathe at night. The inability to breathe through your nose can also cause sleeping difficulties.&#x200B;NocturiaNocturia, or frequent urination, may disrupt your sleep by causing you to wake up during the night. Hormonal imbalances and diseases of the urinary tract may contribute to the development of this condition. (Be sure to call your doctor right away if frequent urination is accompanied by bleeding or pain.)&#x200B;Chronic PainConstant pain can make it difficult to fall asleep. It might even wake you up after you fall asleep. Some of the most common causes of chronic pain include:* arthritis* chronic fatigue syndrome* fibromyalgia* inflammatory bowel disease* persistent headaches* continuous lower back painIn some cases, chronic pain may even be exacerbated by sleep disorders. For instance, doctors believe the development of fibromyalgia might be linked to sleeping problems.&#x200B;GeneticsResearchers have found a genetic basis for narcolepsy, a neurological disorder of sleep regulation that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness.&#x200B;Working the night shiftPeople who work at night often experience sleep disorders because they cannot sleep when they start to feel drowsy. Their activities run contrary to their "biological clocks."&#x200B;MedicinesMany medicines can interfere with sleep, check side effcects.&#x200B;AgingAbout half of all adults over the age of 65 have some sort of sleep disorder. It is not clear if it is a normal part of aging or a result of medicines that older people commonly use.
NotSignal	I’m all alone sweating and in pain I don’t know what to do anymore I’m in cold turkey from medications and I feel like I’m going to die
Signal	Getting to 10 pm, taking my pills and here it goes: 6-hours-long war with my body for a right to fall asleep. After 0:00 I don't feel any power for sitting at PC, after 1 am I can't even hold a phone in hands and chat with reddit friends, so tired I become. After 1.30 am i can't even watch vids, so what I'm left to do is to just stare at my ceiling and wait for 4-5 am till I finally fall asleep.Has anyone been there too? What do you do at these times? I tried listening to music/audiobooks, but I'm so exhausted that any sound irritates me and exhaust me even more... so i hardly can get pleasure from this kind of activity.
NotSignal	At this point, I’ve been awake for almost 23 hours. Up until a few days ago I've been mostly insomnia free for 9 months.Like most of us here, Im not trying to stay awake. I had been in bed with my phone off sitting in the dark for about 5 hours. I just couldn't take staring at the moonlit ceiling fan anymore so on went my phone. I walked about 10 miles yesterday, and have done everything I can do short of medication (don't have any) to fall asleep. My head hurts, my mind is numb and I'm experiencing physical symptoms of exhaustion but I still can't get to bed. For the first time in my life, insomnia has moved beyond physical and is now more mental exhaustion....I want to sleep, I wish a good bit of rest for you all and I hope I'm not lurking on this sub 24 hours from now without having gone to bed yet. Thanks for reading.
NotSignal	Last week I had trouble sleeping and staying asleep. Would sleep at like 1 am and wake up 3 or 4 hours after. I have been getting only 3-5 hours of sleep that week, I also had this feeling when I try to sleep my mind makes me feel like I am floating which makes my stomach to feel hot which makes me feel hot and sweaty and I also have been producing more saliva than normal. So this week has been better, been getting 6-8 hours but cut. I started taking melatonin 3mg everyday 30mins before bed. I sleep at 10 or 11pm but my sleep is always cut, I be waking up at least once during the night example is sleeping at 11pm then waking up at 3pm, I fall back asleep then wake up again at 5, fall back asleep then wake at 7am. Last night I slept at 11pm and woke up at 3 and I was like "I'll just get out of bed" I got out of bed and went in my phone until like 7pm, I closed my eyes and see if I could fall back asleep again, I couldn't but when I was closing my eyes I felt the same sensation like last week, felt like floating, hot stomach but it wasnt as bad as last week. I am worried the sensation is coming back again and I wont be able to sleep much again.
NotSignal	In the first months after quitting Caffeine, it's not unusual to need a restorative nap in the middle of the day.That nap can last 15 to 90 minutes. You'll have to discover the best for you.Try to introduce a nap in your daily routine or whenever you feel the need of it.That condition of needing a nap will diminish over time.Some tips for a good restorative nap in the middle of the day:=> try to make your room as darker as you can=> if possible, take your nap in your bedroom=> use your smartphone alarm to wake you up in a predetermined time=> don't exceed 90 minutesYour nap can be of 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes.The 90 minutes nap will permit you to have a dream, sometimes.After the nap, you may be somewhat drowsy for 10 to 20 minutes.After that, you'll be fully energized and alert as you had just wakened up in the morning.
NotSignal	Does this sound like conditioned insomnia? It started with serious stress in January, and over time developed into automatically jerking myself out of the transition to sleep every time it started to happen. Usually this would come with racing thoughts. Now it seems to be an automatic response, and it happens without thinking about it or anything else. I experience hypnogogia, that pre-sleep stage where you begin to dream, and become alert and think about the weird thoughts that were in my head and wonder why it happened yet again. It stresses me out horribly. Does this by chance happen to anybody else? Reassurance that I'm not alone in this would really help me out with the fear it has generated. I mean, it's all I think about sometimes. My anxiety is insane.
Signal	I've been struggling for a while. Always sleepy during the day, tired at night. I've tried warm milk, reading, a weighted blanket, nothing. Any help?
Signal	I’m currently taking Ambien, but like the title says, it’s not helping anymore. I’ve now been up right at 60 hours and I’m literally sick from it. My body is so tired my muscles are aching and trembling, and I have a migraine... but can I fall asleep? No! I’m wide awake! I have an appointment with my dr tomorrow morning and I’m praying she will switch me to something stronger that will allow me to get some rest. This blows.
NotSignal	I was almost sleeping but no my fucking piece of ahit father started making loud noises on pirpose after I repeateslt asked him to stop. Such a shitty family. All of them can die and fuck off.
NotSignal	I havent been able to catch more than an hour of unbroken sleep the last two days, and i dont know what to do. Its like my entire body can relax but my mind just cant fall unconscious, my body goes numb as i try to sleep but my brain isnt getting the memo.Its extremely frustrating, i spend the entire night yesterday listened tog guided meditations to no effect other than frustrating me further.Im really at the end of my rope here, it truly feels like im going to die from this or that it wont get any better, i need to know that this is temporary and that i can recover somehow.
Signal	I’m a chronic insomniac, and was on Ambien for 15 years. It stopped working so I stopped taking it. I have taken trazodone, Belsomra, zanaflex, remeron, melatonin, ativan, and every herbal/natural supplement without relief. I tried amitriptyline most recently which caused awful side effects.And then I found an old bottle of gabapentin prescribed for shingles pain that I never took. So I decided to try it for sleep. I took 300mg last Friday, and WOW. I slept all night like a baby. For 8 whole hours. I woke up slowly and naturally, and was totally rested. I was maybe a little groggy, but fully awake after coffee. And I felt great, with a ton of energy and in a good mood. I have taken it for 5 nights with consistent results. Got my fingers crossed about this one. Just thought I’d share.
NotSignal	I myself fall asleep to Brooklyn 99. When i can.
NotSignal	For the past roughly year or so I have been getting 2-4 hours sleep maximum, and I am at the point now that I am okay with it, so I do things that I genuinely like doing like playing video games for example, but that doesn’t stop thoughts running through my head at 3am thinking about how lonely I am, I wish I had more friends genuinely, but in terms of sleep, I have come to an acceptance therefore I just try and treat it like a relaxing day at home
Signal	I’m tired all day. I try to sleep and I can’t and can stay up for days at a time. And when I really am about to fall asleep, I have auditory hallucinations. Ehs happens before bed. Lucky right? Even when I’m about to sleep, I’m woken up by screaming or loud crashing sounds or chatter. I wish I could lay there with my eyes closed, but I can’t even do that. Because me laying there with nothing to do, my ehs starts and I start to hear things. I take sleeping pills so that once they kick in I don’t have to lay there and hear things. Anyway just venting. It’s 6am now. Anyone else have ehs?
Signal	i hadn’t slept for a day then the next day i slept for only 2 hours then the next day only 4 hours. it was affecting my vision, and i couldn’t concentrate on anything, i was tripping and i was physically weak as fuck. so i stayed home from school and somehow slept for 13 hours. now i can’t sleep again and i have etas for the next two days. this shit is gonna be the death of me i swear. it’s been 4 years of this insomnia shit and i’m over it lmao
Signal	Ok long story short I have exams in a few days and my sleeping schedule is incredibly messed up (4am-4pm)I can't sleep before 4am for some reason, even taking melatonin i just can't, my best friend gave me xanax but i can't bring myself to take it.I have GAD and i'm terrified of medication, i'm scared it might trigger a panic attack or that i might develop and addiction after even a few uses.I really want to fix my sleeping schedule before my exams, what should I do? please help i've been trying to get myself to take this freakin pills for days but i just can't do it i'm too scared
NotSignal	I haven’t slept a wink.I think god is mocking me.
Signal	i was diagnosed w insomnia as a child but it’s gotten better throughout the years. I went probably a year w a normal sleep schedule (normal as in, i can fall asleep. I usually sleep for 10-14 hours now which is not normal lol), but recently i haven’t been able to sleep before 3-5am. I was wondering if anyone else experienced that once you fall asleep you continuously wake up throughout the night. It feels like hell to be able to fall back asleep again even if you’re exhausted.
Signal	The past 7-8 years or so I’d take Benadryl or Dramamine to help fall asleep. They do help a little, but I was worried they’d be bad using them long term. Also they only really help me fall asleep, not stay asleep, which is my second issue. Two weeks ago I decided to finally see a doctor about my sleep issues. I let him know I have serious problems falling asleep and staying asleep. And once I wake up in the night, I usually can’t fall back asleep. Also my bladder wakes me up a lot, so that’s fun too. He prescribed me trazodone to try. I was very excited, I’m a pharmacy tech so I know it’s a fairly potent sedative. I’ve tried it four different nights now. Started at the initial 50mg, which did absolutely nothing... and then two other nights I upped it to 100mg. (Per one of the pharmacists I work with.)Nothing. Not a thing. freaking over the counter Benadryl makes me sleepier than this. I won’t lie, I’m pretty upset. I was so excited that this would finally help me. Has anyone else had good or bad luck with trazodone?
NotSignal	Miraculously, I managed to fall asleep at around 2am. Then I woke up a couple of hours later. It's 5:43am now, and I'm not sure when I'll sleep and when I'll wake up.All of this aside - if you're suffering too, if you're exhausted and frustrated, I hope it helps in some tiny way to know that you're not alone. Misery loves company, right? :)
Signal	I take klonipon at that point because I know it won’t keep me asleep past my alarm, but I really want to find an option that doesn’t involve meds. My brain goes too fast and I can’t fall back asleep if I wake up after 3 sometimes 2
NotSignal	Does anyone else ever just put off going to sleep even if you’re tired just because you don’t want tomorrow to start?
Signal	I’ve always had problems falling and maintaining sleep in the winter I’m 17 just for reference and this year I’ve had like 2 months of bad sleep and I feel horrible I’ve got to the point where I can fall asleep but can’t maintain it I always wake up after around 6hrs and it makes me mad I’m a pro esport athlete and I’ve been getting worse and worse and this is a problem as my organization will drop me if I can’t perform and not being able to sleep has really effected my performance I used to be able to sleep even 12hrs a night now I struggle with getting 7 so I tried for 3 months to self medicate with Xanax I’m 3 weeks off of it as if effected me rly weirdly wondering if anyone has any ideas of what I can do to maintain sleep at night and start getting 8hours a nightCurrently taking valerian root sleep desired from 1:30am-9:30am what I currently get 2:30am-8am then wake up for an hour eat and fall back asleep to feel super tired and sluggish I usually wake up at 8am get up to pee get back into bed and try to fall back asleep it’s like I get to the point where I’m about to and my body is like oh good ur gonna sleep then my mind ramps up and wakes up to be super alert but my body is tired then later in the day my body is awake and mind is dead I can’t synch them up or stay asleep to feel rested help please my livelyhood and dream relys on being able to sleep again
NotSignal	I wasn't able to sleep last night and it seems I can t do it this night either. I ve tried to solve my sleep cycle by staying awake all previous day(after a sleepless nighr) - and I've felt asleep between 10-12 AM- but it seems it backfired on me. Currently it's 1 AM, I m tired as fuck but I just can't sleep. Also, I couldn t sleep well 2 days before last night, after I've had another sleepslee night. Any suggestions?
Signal	I've been fighting with insomnia for a couple of years now (about 3 years I think). Even when I was a kid I never really slept well, but when I was about 16 it started to worsen dramatically.For me the main issue is that I take hours to fall asleep and when I eventually fall asleep I wake up constantly. Every couple of weeks I might get a good night which I'm extremely grateful for, but even then I rarely feel somewhat well rested. I have tried all sorts of meds besides benzos because I don't want to get addicted. Usually when I try to fall asleep it feels like I'm waiting for my body to get tired enough to eventually drift off even though I'm already exhausted to begin with. (not sure if that makes sense, it's difficult to explain) Anyway sorry I don't just want to complain but I thought that some background information may be necessary. What do some of you guys do to pass the time without waking yourselves up too much?That might be a stupid question idk, it's my first post here. Sorry for wasting your time if it is.
NotSignal	I drank some alcohol last night and booze make it so I can't sleep and I need to be up at 7 am so I can film a BMX video for my sponsor does anyone have any tips on how to stay awake and we'll the next day
Signal	So I’ll try n keep this short and maybe i shouldn’t be complaining but the only way I’m even able to fall asleep is with Seroquel and Valium and even then I get maybe 4 hours of sleep tops..... I mean I guess it’s all i need? But being up 20 hours a day gets kinda exhausting physically and mentally. Idk any tips would be great I’m on disability right now and I believe the YMCA is free for me then, might just start swimming or idk some sorta work out till I’m fuckin dead n hopefully pass out an for longer? I’ve tried this before in a sense a girl I was seeing lived about 15-20 miles away and I’d bike there like if I didn’t make it on time the world would end ( don’t ask my why I have no clue ) and still would find myself not being able to sleep / if so be asleep for very long. I’ll stop my bitching hope you all got Some sleep last night n if not hope you can truck through the day cause I know it isn’t your first night without the sweet fucking release of sleep.....
Signal	Yes, sounds weird. I've been sleeping less and less due to the fear of sleeping alone (going to bed at 4is and sleeping a few hours but having a hard time falling asleep, waking up around 8ish, but just force myself to sleep more but it's not deep sleep). Anyone else have this? I've had insomnia that lasted 3-ish months but was going to a rough patch in my life and becoming dependent on sleeping pills. This is different. I want to sleep and am tired, but am scared to because it causes me anxiety.
Signal	It’s 6:35am and I’ve not slept a minute 😭 this happens every night, I’m sick of not sleeping... it’s negatively impacting my uni performance as I don’t have the energy to go to any lectures 🥱 I just want to sleep normally again, any suggestions? *right AND wrong answers accepted*
Signal	Amazon has a dozen or so pills and I’ve tried all of them. Yesterday tried Shut Eye and I feel awful today like a zombieI’m addicted to Unisom and only take half a pill per night but was hoping something could wane me offApparently these herbal supplements are a waste. I’m so tired of feeling like a zombie
Signal	First I can only sleep for 4 hours per night for 2 months and now I can't even sleep at all. I don't thinking or worrying when I go to sleep it just my brain is not going to turn itself off. Already went to get check by sleep psychologist, took some pills but it's becoming less effective each day until it doesn't do anything at all. Will I ever gonna sleep normally again? This is the only problem keep me from living my life happily.
NotSignal	Title says it all I wanted to fix my sleep schedule before school starts next week because I was going to bed between 6 am- 7:30 am and wake up at around 1:30-3. I've done this before with no issue like 6 other times before but for some reason tonight I just can't fall asleep and it's frustrating the hell out of me because I wanted to fix my sleep schedule only for it be pretty much the same or worse. I took melatonin which usually knocks me out 4 hours ago and it hasn't kicked in or I'm just way to overtired. My anxiety is through the roof just trying to look for answers. This sucks :( pls if you could give any advice i would greatly appreciate it
NotSignal	Mine are super weird...I simply don’t get tired anymore, at all. So I end up sleeping every 2 to 4 days and between 1 and 12 hours.It’s strange because I never know how many breakfasts I should eat or how many coffees I’m allowed because I don’t remember where “morning” begins and how many have passed.
NotSignal	My eyes get swollen (especially lower eyelid area) with dark circles underneath. Does anyone own a miraculous concealer or eye cream/treatment that they’d recommend? My skin is dry so I can’t layer on much of any one product. Thanks!
Signal	But this won't be forever. It never is. I'm trying to enjoy being well-rested, but I can't help but dread the insomnia acting up again. And I know it will. That's what's so disheartening about this for me. I've had this problem on-and-off for my entire life. I'm so used to it coming back to haunt me that I can no longer enjoy the times where it's not bothering me. I want to think positive, but...I can't anymore.
NotSignal	So last night I think my body just gave in to the exhaustion after two months of intense sleep deprivation. I think in total I slept for 6.5-7 hours which is unheard of for me. I went on an adventure like no other. These are the dreams I had-I was on a beach in a storm, I slept in the bathtub at my grandma's house, I attended my mom's funeral (that was pretty sad), I went into this crazy fun house/haunted house in a car with the top down and these bright colorful clown things kept jumping out at me and it was instant regret, I went to a hypnotist for sleep and he gave me like 20 cards to hold in my right hand which I kept dropping, I had to rush to an airport, I flew on a plane, ahh! There were more than that, These ones just stood out the most. I woke up and smiled because I actually slept. I could cry.
Signal	It's like 3am and I can't sleep for stress this is so shitty
NotSignal	Insomnia sucks, and it kinda feels like everything else sucks too, but we're gonna make it through this. If you can't sleep, do whatever you need to do to relax and take care of yourself. I'm sitting up in the early morning hours chatting with my fiance and watching Jenna Marbles' videos. It puts a smile on my face and makes it easier, and right now that's the best I can do.
Signal	I had this problem few months ago but with everything going on now it’s gotten to the point if I wake up in middle of night or notice I can’t sleep, I instantly start to get stressed to the point I give myself a headache and I’m tired of it because I know my thought patterns and he way I view me not sleeping at a certain time as a “bad” thing when I’m reality..it’s not bad, I’m trying my best and need to be more kind to myself. Just hard to realize and see that when I’m in my bed feeling so stressed!!
Signal	Just curious if there’s anyone else out there that actually thanks their insomnia for extra productivity? I’ve had pretty bad insomnia since I was 11, most people don’t believe that I can function normally off maybe 4-6 hrs of sleep a week. It’s normal my days blur and the small naps keep me from losing it. However I am working two jobs and sleeping maybe an hour a day. No crash and this is totally manageable for me. Anyone else out there learn to live with their insomnia? Dive into work to keep your mind from racing on things that don’t matter? Or hate insomnia but also handle it well?
NotSignal	I definitely understand that living with a person who has insomnia can be challenging. And my specific case is a pain in the ass as I can fall asleep with no issues but will wake intermittently through out the night. When I wake up, I get up usually to smoke weed and put myself back to sleep again yes I know the constant up and down is obnoxious I’ve been told...and I do truly empathize with him...but it’s how he reacts...huffing and puffing...passively aggressively moaning...turning over hard to let me know I’ve pissed him off...it’s hurtful because I can’t really control what’s happening...i try my damn hardest. I do yoga and meditate several times a week but I’ve had a lot of trauma in life and there for am an anxious mess and very hyper vigilant... I don’t know what to say to him anymore...We’re both losing sleep and I feel terrible...but he’s making me feel MORE awful...I needed to vent to people who get it I guess...he doesn’t want me to sleep in our guest room...and I get treated like shit when I wake him up and he doesn’t get good sleep...what to do?
Signal	Hello, this is a new update post of my last post I made. Nothing have changed I used all your guys tips and nothing worked. I will get 1 hour of sleep if I.sleep now and tbh it's not worth it. I've been feeling really suicidal lately, I really wanna sleep for 5 hours for the first time, I'm sick atleast 3 times a day cause of sleep I havent gotten. I really wanna end it all, fuck man, I'd rather be dead
NotSignal	Working much better than any drugs or supplements for me just following the normal reco to avoid bright or blue light a few hours before bed, a few minutes of exercise in the sun first thing in the morning, and stay on schedule. Has anyone had good experience with an artificial bright or ice light source in the morning? In the north and in the winter, I get no sun naturally. I wanted to get a UV or tanning lamp to use for a few minutes in the morning, in addition to normal indoor lights. Vitamin D is also really important for coronavirus outcome and you need UV B, best is about 300nm. Anyone have experience or recommendation on power or time needed?
Signal	Everyday I can't sleep. Usually I have to wait to around 3am or later to even get sleepy. Sometimes I get tired before then, but even when I'm tired I can't sleep. When I finally do get to sleep, I'm always woken up several times during sleeping. I also get nightmares everyday which wake me up. I've already tried tips online like showering before bed, reading, listening to music, putting my phone down, etc. It stresses me out so much to be able to not sleep. Sometimes when I get woken up in the middle of the night, I get extreme mood swings and even get thoughts about suicide. Then when I wake up in the morning I'm extremely sleepy and I have to fight myself to not fall asleep at school. I don't know what to do.
Signal	i hate when you’re exhausted from work and ur body aches for rest but ur fully awake it’s like i’m tired but but not enough to sleep it’s truly the WORST
NotSignal	Has anyone tried microdosing/macrodosing LSD or shrooms to rewire yout brain? Apparently there is no immediate help, but since it is explored as a tool for anxiety, depression, ptsd and other mental help problems, it sounds like it could be useful. Thoughts?
Signal	I had a motorcycle accident almost 2 years ago an have been taking trazodone to try an help me sleep. If I take 50mg my legs start hurting noticeably more. I got upped from my doctor to 100mg an when I take that it hurts horribly. Has anyone else felt this with that medication?
NotSignal	It’s 3 in the morning once again.I’m up and overthinking like I always do.My patience with myself is running thin.I hope that I don’t completely destroy you.I’m no angel I love to sin.The devil has something in me he’s beginning to brew.You won’t see it coming till only then.It will leave you cold, alone and blue.It’s 3 in the morning another night.I wonder where these evil dreams come from.My angels and sleep paralysis are putting up a fight.You sill stay with me even though you are completely succumb.The room goes dark but my head turns on a light.My whole body goes numb from the tip of my tongue.All of me is screaming as I lose my sight.I’m tied down to this bed but I need to run.
Signal	Went to bed with a horrible headache at 10pm fell asleep at around 11 due to exhaustion. Woke up at 12am “fully wired”. Been tossing and turning for hours trying to go back to sleep. It’s now 4:30 am and I think i’m giving up on sleep for tonight. I hate this.
NotSignal	I don't get it, even on 8 hours of sleep I still don't feel very refreshed and it's pissing me off. My fitbit even says after 8 hours of sleep that my sleep score was just fair. What's going on here, I don't know how to get quality despite getting quantity? Do any of you experience this?
NotSignal	Haven’t had insomnia this bad in a long, long time but, yeah, haven’t slept a wink in two days and I’m utterly ruined.Normally I’d take off sick but I phoned in over Christmas and I know they need the staff (last weekend before everybody goes back to work, the cinema where I work is going to be hectic). Currently it’s 3:30AM and I’m on my third night, no sleep, going to go to the A&E (hospital) on my way back from work to see i they can at least put me under or something — feel like I’m going mad. But, until then, I’ve got work from 9-5 and, like I said, I can’t really take it off so I’m wondering if you all have any tips on how I can a) not pass out and b) tell my dickhead of a boss that it’s possible that I could pass out.It sucks but I’m still on probation and I really need this job: no family, no savings, rent due etc. If I lose it, I’m properly screwed and I’ve got a funny feeling day 3 is going to be a real tough stretch.Any help? :)
NotSignal	I had two dreams tonight which doesn't happen often. I had a dream that there were wasps everywhere all over the house. On every window. And I also had a dream about the doctor telling me that my right ear has been bleeding profusely for a month and a half... Possibly two of the worst dreams I've ever had.
NotSignal	Hey guys, been interested in the oura ring for trying to improve my sleeping habits. I was wondering if anybody here has used it and what they think of it? Thanks
Signal	My cousin is 29 years old and she has had this issue for a few years now; she'll be able to fall asleep with little effort, but sometime in the middle of the night, she will wake up and end up just laying there for what feels like hours. She usually never falls back asleep. She never really knows what time she wakes up. She is now pregnant, only in her first trimester, and her doctor gave her a prescription for B6 and something else, she is not quite sure. (I will update with that information when I can). It helps her fall asleep faster, but it does nothing to help her stay asleep. She's really struggling and our coworkers (she's the supervisor of my department) are starting to really get on her nerves and she is having trouble focusing on even the smallest of day-to-day activities. Send help !!!!! LOLShe is not a fan of Sleepytime Tea, which I drink when I wake up in the middle of the night. And she is wary of bringing it back up with her doctor because she doesn't think they will prescribe her anything else since she is pregnant. Any non-prescription suggestions I can give her?
Signal	I just want to sleep for a really long time. Is it safe to take more than 1 Zopiclone (7.5mg). Can I for instance take 3 safety?
Signal	Ugh i’m so tired at this point i’m not sure if this post is going to make much sense, but i’ll do my best haha. i haven’t gotten more than 10 hours of sleep in the past 3 days. i’m jittery and my head has been hurting for the last 20 hours. my fiancé is really worried and keeps telling me i need to sleep earlier and try to get my sleep schedule back on track. i’ve tried taking melatonin and other otc sleeping aids but they don’t work too well. i fell asleep but i’m back up within 3 hours. i’m just hoping someone here might have some advice. i’ll do almost anything to just get 5 solid hours of sleep
NotSignal	4th night in row with little to no sleep. Idk what to do anymore. OTC stuff don’t work & i’m tolerant to prescription meds (zopiclone) . Not feeling bad except I have a headache, but idk if its work calling my doc for that tomorrow? I’m so fkg sick of having insomnia.
NotSignal	Some stressors have arised recently which are 100% triggering the insomnia. I exercise a ton and am pretty tired at the end of the day, but once I shut the lights out - the anxiety comes and wakes me up entirely. It’s 2am right now and I feel like I could go for another workout!
NotSignal	Does anybody else sometimes find themselves lying with their eyes open staring at the ceiling or a wall without realising when trying to sleep?This seems to be happening a lot to me, especially recently, and I have no idea why
NotSignal	So long story short, I have suffered from sleep paralysis and insomnia for over a decade. Recently, for the first time, I woke up having severe angina/chest pains at 5am in the middle of a sleep paralysis episode. Is it possible the two conditions are related?
Signal	# How I stop taking sleeping pills? I use to take it after 2 or 3 days. Not daily. Is there any way to to recover from this addiction? After use that pills I have face constipation problem, tiredness, and my eye sight going to weak. I have take Cipin 25. This medicine contains Clozapine. Please help me.
NotSignal	I’ve had insomnia for 5 years now and I honestly told myself “this will go away within a year or two” and boy was I wrong; how do you people go to work with insomnia?? This makes me sad knowing I can’t sleep :(
Signal	My story began in January. I've posted about it a few times here; extreme and worsening stress that caused constant hypnic jerks to happen over and over and over again. I was self medicating with alcohol for a while, but my psychiatrist agreed to prescribe me klonopin under the condition that I would stop drinking. I'm on day 6 of the klonipin and I have actually slept mostly through the night every night! It has been incredible. I've slept more in almost a week than I would in a month, it was pretty terrible. So now I've found something that works.. but there's guilt involved at the same time. I know the implications of long term benzo use, and that aspect scares me, but it has essentially saved me. Does anyone else rely on a benzo for sleep? I know that it's designed for and prescribed for severe anxiety mainly, and I do have that. I've been a week without sleep on more than one occasion. I guess I hope to hear some stories from others in the same boat and maybe shed some of this guilt I feel. Any input is appreciated. I love to hear other's perspectives.
NotSignal	I’ve been awake all night thinking about how depressed I am and crying about my life 😔 next to someone who’s sleeping next to me.. this sucks so bad. I wish there was a way to make myself feel better 😔
NotSignal	Keen to find out from people on this sub whether any of you sleep better after you clean your bedding?For me I tend to sleep better for the next day or two after I clean my sheets. This could be a great way of testing the psychological side of insomnia and the relationships we have with our beds - I feel like fresh sheets/bedding temporarily resets or reduces the negative relationship. If this trick works for us this could be a sign we're suffering from a negative bed=sleep relationship.
Signal	So I started having insomnia out of the blue a little over a year ago. Started having a sleepless night or two a week. Started smoking weed and it helped for a good amount of time, maybe over a month. Then I would have maybe one day a week of little to no sleep. This past summer is when things started to get really bad. A bad job really fucked with me and I had multiple nights a week of 4 or 5 hours of sleep. In October it got its worst - like two straight weeks of 4 or 5 hours. It's been on and off ever since. I don't have a problem with falling asleep but staying asleep has been a struggle. I'll wake up after 4 or 5 hours and my mind will be racing and I'd feel so damn energized. It was especially hard on weekends because I work in the service industry and unfortunately have to do brunch and wake up earlier than usual - around 7:30am. It was really starting to mess with all aspects of my life.I posted in this sub before about being curious about psilocybin mushrooms and all the big discoveries being made about it's effects on anxiety, depression, PTSD etc. I've done mushrooms before in small amounts for fun but never therapeutically. I initially bought some with the goal of having one big trip. I took my first small dose actually at work around 8:30pm which backfired because I wasn't in a good mood in the first place and a drunk customer yelled at me and made a scene because she thought someone stole her phone. So my anger only amplified and the energy that mushrooms give me made me stay up until almost 5am. However, I ended up sleeping for about 6 or 7 hours. Although I had such a shitty night before I woke up feeling oddly energized and noticeably optimistic about...everything. I gave it some thought and decided to take another small dose in the afternoon before work. It was amazing being on this small amount - I was anxiety free, generally more present and optimistic. I slept wonderfully that night before my morning brunch shift. Did the same thing the next day - worked again perfectly. The next day and the next. So it's been an entire week of amazing 7-8 hour sleep!I don't know y'all, I don't want to jinx it but this might be my form of medication for this insomnia and anxiety I've been dealing with. Obviously I wish I didn't have to take something for this stuff but it was truly messing up my life. I've also been using Genexa Sleepology (an all natural night time sleep aid). People get on meds from big pharm so why not consider an all natural from the earth remedy like psilocybin?? I also know I can't stop working on all other aspects of my life so I'm still investing in therapy, exercising a lot, and meditating a lot. I urge people to try mushrooms. Literally take the size of the tip of a pencil in the afternoon or early evening and you'll notice the effects (if you buy good stuff). Don't take it at night since it releases serotonin and will energize you. I hope everyone sleeps well tonight.
Signal	I know not everyone works in a environment that is forgiving. After dealing with insomnia from being in high school and having to go even when I haven't slept at all that night and sometimes for two days. Dealing with working. Feeling confident you can do it and then it all comes crashing down when your hallucinating and telling your boss for the first time. Sounding like the lamest excuse " hey I haven't been to bed yet and I can't come in to work because I'm delusional. Btw I have frequent insomnia but I acted like the model employee upon hiring and now your thinking I'm a liar because you don't understand this problem or you are more concerned about having steady reliable workers" when I got my current job I waited until about a month to express that I have a disorder. I talked privately with my boss and luckily has the options of working overnight. I heavily expressed that certain times cannot work for me. If I was put on too early I would probably come into work delusional. Not even on earth at that point and would do more harm than good. I also expressed how hard it has been for me to hold a job down in the past due to bosses not accepting a disorder I cannot change. A disorder I have fought and been plagued with. I can't say for everyone. Most jobs have a 30 day probation period. So after that mark If you express your disorder and they fire you because of it. You can sue. That's illegal to fire someone due to an illness. Even illnesses of the mind.
NotSignal	I don't sleep naturally anymore. I'm just up having a staring contest with the ceiling or wall every day for a month now. I have no thoughts anymore other than "when will I sleep" so it gets boring. Just waiting. I don't wanna self diagnose since I don't know too much about it.I get this often it's just in bursts and it doesn't last that many nights so bow i'm concerned about it lasting about a month. That aspect is new to me. Posting this at around 3AM since I have nothing better to do. I don't dream anymore, don't sleep til my brain, body, some external force or something decides it's time to shut down. I never know when that is i'm just gone at like early morning.What on Earth is this garbage? I just want to sleep.
Signal	Ok i know this is super weird because idk if anyone else does this but does anyone else start drifting off and having those microslewps for like 30 sec and then all the sudden you to sit up like in bed and you just stare at the wall for a sec and then you realize what just happened and youre back to square one trying to fall asleep. I dont know why but it happens occasionally. Like a few times a month but when it happens it happens a couple times in the night. It usually is worsened when i take melatonin or a OTC sleeping pills. I have not experienced this on prescribed sleeping pills

NotSignal	Does anyone experience feeling awake or like they didn’t sleep at all with insomnia? “sleep misconception” I know I’m sleeping because I remember my dreams very easily but it seems I’m sleeping very lightly or something and I then I question if I was even asleep at all. It’s very strange.
NotSignal	when i’m closing my eyes and entering a deeper state of consciousness i get a burning sensation in my stomach/chest then my heart begins to race and i can’t calm down because of my anxiety. i breathe faster and it makes my body feel so heavy
NotSignal	Lately, I've been getting up from my bed really early in the morning and usually asking or saying things that doesn't make any sense to my parents. But everytime this happens, I'm able to remember everything when someone talks about it.I've been trying to find out what this is, since one of the aspects of insomnia is not remembering anything. So maybe it's something else, but I've no clue what it is. So does anyone knows what is this?
NotSignal	Does anyone have any experience with tolerance development with mirtazapine (i.e. the absence of sedation)? Did it come back after a certain waiting period (weeks/months)?
NotSignal	I’m so happy I’ve found this subreddit. I’ve suffered with insomnia for about 2 years now and my doctors are not believing me! I haven’t ever tried sleeping tablets because they don’t believe me, and I want to try them to see if they help. Does anyone have any suggestions for support?
Signal	I realized around noon that I would not be getting a nap in before my 3 o clock shift. This was my second night in a row of only getting about an hour of sleep, the kind where you’re just barely dozing and the slightest thing wakes you. I went ahead and showered and got dressed a couple hours early so I could just zone out for a while before work. I noticed that my hair felt funny, greasy and clumpy, and- oh. Yep. I forgot to rinse the shampoo out of my hair. Just crawled back into bed with soapy hair. I’ve had worse bouts of insomnia, but this is a first. Thank god I walk to work, I’m in no shape to operate a vehicle. Fingers crossed for some proper sleep tonight. Have y’all ever done anything like this while loopy and strung out from sleep deprivation?
Signal	I haven’t slept in a lot of hours and I’m about to try to sleep but my head hurts and I feel like I’m just losing my mind from insomnia. Does anybody else get this?
NotSignal	You check the time, it's late and you start to worry that you won't get sleep tonight. Your anxiety increases a little.So you start getting ready, and each thing you do has been associated with dread and stress because its a reminder that your about to get another sleepless night. Your anxiety increases a little moreSo after you've brushed your teeth, cooled down your room, taken your melatonin, etc. You lay in bed and sit there in dread as you wait for the uncertainty that is your body deciding to fall asleep. Your anxiety spikes.You've associated sleep with anxiety and your body cant sleep with anxiety. Your bedtime routine being a set of reminders of your lack of sleep.If you've tried everything that your supposed to and it still hasn't helped, try forgetting you have trouble falling asleep. Do things that people who have the easiest time falling asleep do. That coke in the fridge you won't drink after 2 because of its caffeine, drink some right before bed, its oddly liberating. You've been told not to sleep with the TV on? Do it anyways! Do things in your bed that distract you from the fact your trying to fall asleep.This is what I did after trying everything, I recommend it only as a last resort. Ive been able to get a full night's rest from constant anxiety.Your head could be the only thing preventing you from having a good night. Best of luck and if this doesn't work for you after trying it for a few nights stop doing it.
NotSignal	I don’t do achohol and every now and then hypnic jerks happen to me and cause to lose 4 hours of sleep.
NotSignal	I went about 5 months getting 5-8 hours and now I can't sleep again. It's been about 5 days so far of less than 4 hour sleep and two nights with none. I don't even know how it started. I wasn't doing anything differently. Oh well. I'll deep clean my room and sort out my bead and bust out the melatonine and hopefully I can get back on track.
Signal	Hello everyone.Recently I've been having trouble sleeping. I have been practicing all the necessary sleep hygiene principles I've seen others suggest, and I'm not on any medication except vitamin supplements and omeprazole.Essentially for the past few days, I've only been able to fall asleep around 3-4 AM, and I wake up at around 8-9 AM. This has been consistent for the past three days and I am only able to fall asleep on my sofa as opposed to my bed - where I just end up tossing and turning without any results. What can I do to ensure that I can sleep at a more consistent time and allow myself to return back to being able to sleep in my bed? I've tried everything from turning my screens off and the like. My body isn't feeling tired, and that's what seems to be the most concerning factor in all this. I want to learn how to solve this issue so that this doesn't develop into a long-term sleeping problem.(I do snore at night, is it possible that apnea might be preventing me from falling asleep easily? I also take multivitamins with iron, folic acid and vitamin D every night. Could any of these had caused my sleeping issues?)
Signal	Can I work a full time hard labor job, work on multiple projects when I get home, smoke pot like a chimney AND take kratom (the relaxing kind) and still wake up at fuckin 230 every morning wide awake! My insomnia usually flares up for a few months then goes away but this time is fucked! I'm such a grumpy fuck to everyone around me even though my life is going great and I'm accomplishing my goals. Being exhausted physically and mentally superchargers your grumpy factor when you have so much energy. It sucks! Fuck you insomnia!
Signal	Ever since I(M) was really young, I've had anxiety (diagnosed). I was on meds for about 5 months when I was 13. They did nothing, so after a month or so and I stopped taking them and my anxiety gradually got better when I stopped. As it was getting better, I started noticing that I was always down on myself, and to me and my friends, I seemed depressed. Ever since I started high school, it seems that my anxiety has come back stronger along with depression being way worse. I'm now 16 and I noticed, for the past few months, I havent gotten more than 5 hours of sleep a night. Not a single night. On average, I probably get 20 hours of sleep a week. For being 16, that's not good for my mental state lol. On weekends I will smoke weed and I will usually stay up until 4 or so. On weekdays, I rarely smoke and will stay up until 3-5:30. The one thing I noticed that keeps me up is my phone, but I'm on it because I cant sleep. If I didnt have my phone, I'd be productive instead of sleeping.
NotSignal	After i quit using marijuana my ability to fall asleep is much worse, dont have the slightest bit of clue as to what to try now.
NotSignal	Me and boyfriend sleep in the same room. He just started a new job 2 days ago and he has gotten only 5 hours of sleep in that time, tomorrow is his third day and he's supposed to be up at 830am, it's 2am here. He's never had insomnia like this before, he says he's exhausted but so paranoid about not being able to sleep. We have both taken a combination of kratom, unisom, hydroxyzine and weed. None of those things have helped us sleep. The funny thing is, I was sleeping fine for a while but his insomnia triggered mine because I'm just so anxious for him. We have been sleeping at like 4am for months now because of COVID but were just getting our schedule back on track until this.I'm very worried about him driving to work this morning on such little sleep but he's been unemployed for a year, so he does not want to call out of work on his third day. I'm extremely stressed, he's super high strung and upset and I feel awful. I don't have a job so I'm not even remotely worried about not sleeping, just super nervous for him.What should we do? I've never had this bad of insomnia and unisom usually always works.
NotSignal	When I try to relax or I just forget about it but my brain just starts to wake me up again, I don't know why, im so mad and deppresed.
NotSignal	my spring semester for college starts monday and i currently been falling asleep around 6-8 am (it’s currently 5:50 am).i’ve decided i’m just gonna not sleep tonight and save myself some trouble so i can be tired later in the night and hopefully actually sleep and stay asleep more than 3 hours.
Signal	Most of the time I fall asleep after being awake for around 18 - 20 hours, but on Monday i was awake for 25 hours before falling asleep, and today I’ve currently been awake for 28 hours and it feels like I’m never going to fall asleep. The process of me getting sleep medication has been paused because of covid and it’s been kinda difficult because I was scheduled to have an appointment to get a prescription this month and now it’s going to be another 1-3 months after lockdown ends. Possibly longer because of how many people are behind on treatment plans. Insomnia has kept me out of school bar a couple of days here and there since October and one of the only good things to come out of this whole corona ordeal for me is now everyone’s sleep schedule is fucked, so some of my mates are up during the night so I’m not just talking to the walls. Sorry for my rambling and thanks for listening if you got this far.
NotSignal	The way I sleep and the anatomy of my shoulder (dysplasia) makes it hurt towards the morning and I can’t sleep. Did any of you learn to sleep differently in a different position? Or no ?
Signal	Hey guys, basically what the title says, i'm having trouble sleeping in the same bed as my girlfriend. I've struggled with insomnia for the past year or so but for the most part I am able to manage it well and will only have 1-2 bad nights every fortnight, otherwise I can sleep 8 hours easy. Even at the start of our relationship I could sleep well with her, however for the last 10 or so times I have stayed over at her house I have consistently gotten 4 hours or less sleep. We tried to force my body into sleeping by just staying over together every night this week, however since sunday (it is Wednesday here in my country) I have probably had about 9 hours sleep in total. No matter how much of a long day I've had, I get into the bed and just don't feel tired at all, not particularly alert, just not tired. I will usually try to sleep and then after 30 minutes or so if I can't I'll get up or read or something and then try again, this process repeats until about 2-3 in the morning until I finally crash out and I get 3-4 hours sleep until my alarm goes off.&#x200B;Just looking for any tips or advice anyone might have. Have tried a whole bunch of things, separate blankets, having a fan on, sleeping as far away from each other as possible, having a consistent sleep schedule/wind down routine. Nothing seems to be working and it is having quite a strain on our relationship (as we want to be able to share a bed) and my life personally, as my days are extremely busy with university and sports and I am wearing myself to the bone doing this.
Signal	I know melatonin has been a running joke in this sub reddit but i’m finally thinking of using sleeping meds and i want to start with something small such as melatonin. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations of which brand is best and what dosage should be taken. Thank youa
Signal	Is anyone here anemic? Idk if it has anything to do with my insomnia. I had insomnia for a year. It sucks.
NotSignal	I remember trying this a while back ago but I only remember feeling mellowed out however I'm thinking about giving it a chance. How has it worked for you?
Signal	Prior to this quarantine period, I haven't had any trouble conditioning myself to sleep between the hours of 10 and 11PM. Although I have been guilty of staying up late until 1 or 2AM in spite of the fact that I have to wake up at 4 to prepare myself for work, I can still, as mentioned earlier, put myself to sleep at 10 if I choose to, usually with a very little amount of struggle. However, ever since the quarantine began, I have been excessively abusing the freedom that I suddenly possess to stay awake as long as I please. It would not be an uncommon sight for me to remain awake at 4 or 5 in the morning, just lying in my bed and watching YouTube videos or reading online articles until the urge to sleep finally comes at me. I would then wake up at half past 12 in the afternoon, usually with a headache or a feeling of grogginess (but not very often).This has been my daily routine for the past month, and my body clock has suffered considerable damage in the process, something which I had only realized two days ago. My stupid logic in defense of this behavior was that I thought it would be easy for me to revert to my normal sleeping pattern once the need to do so arrives, which would then put enough pressure on me to adapt to the situation accordingly. But it wasn't as simple as I had been foolish enough to believe once I actually began taking the measures needed to put an end to this self-destructive behavior that I had gotten myself into. (I credit Ariana Huffington's book "The Sleep Revolution" for persuading me to finally get rid of the habit).When I tried to sleep early for the first time last Saturday night, I kept my phone at an off-limits location so as to avoid the temptation of using it for the remainder of the night. I didn't have any problem with not using my phone, but I discovered that I had become far too accustomed to not getting any sleep until the wee hours of the morning, and so all my attempts proved to be futile as I spent the next 5-6 hours tossing and turning at my bed. Next thing I knew, the chickens were roosting and it was already 5AM. It felt like being trapped in a nightmare without being asleep at all, and it was the worst situation that I have ever found myself in since my first week at the job. Not even the willpower-draining experience of having gone cold turkey from watching pornography can top this. This is far worse by a long margin. I tried it again earlier this night and got the same results, and here I am writing this down at 3 in the morning, hoping that being able to share my sleeping troubles will help make things slightly easier for me. With all these being said, here is my question: how long would I struggle with this phase of sleeplessness before I can successfully reintegrate my original sleeping habits?
Signal	I have trouble sleeping in the night no matter how exhausted I am, how early I woke up.After a cup of coffe in the morning, I can wake up and make it through the day despite being a little tired, but today I have had pain in all my body (mainly my legs) to the point where I can barely walk. I was sure that I was so tired that I would faint the second I go to bed, but here we are, soon 3AM, and still awake...I can deal with lack of sleep as I'm used to it, but this pain is hindering. What should I do ? Would regular painkiller work ?
NotSignal	So, I dream a lot, I don't sleep well because of it. Sometimes when I sleep though, there is this intense, tingling pressure in my head that is supremely uncomfortable, and really hard to simply open my eyes when experiencing. It's like I have to rip myself awake from it. I always feel I am awake when I experience it, and I always feel aware of it happening, I think "this is happening again." It doesn't always happen, but enough for me to recognise it as a thing. Shapes of light (in my mind's eye) can precede or follow it. Best I can explain it at the moment. Wondering if it's something else I have to be anxious about.So, anyone else experience anything like it?
NotSignal	Tried 50mg, 100mg and is not working as a sedative... just makes my nose stuffy!
NotSignal	Hi everyone,For the past several months, I've been sleeping poorly because I can't control my bedroom temperature - the insulation is poor, the thermostat doesn't work, and for some reason this room is much warmer than the rest of the house. This is an environmental issue - I don't have any underlying insomnia, mood, or physical health issues.At the moment, I can't move out or have the place renovated. I've already tried several lifestyle/environment changes to generally improve my sleeping conditions - changing my mattress, using blackout curtains/a sleep mask, installing an AC, going to bed at the same time each day, using dimmer lights before bed, not using technology in bed, etc. Does anyone have experience with using medication for sleep issues that are environmentally caused? I would love to hear any thoughts, thank you.
Signal	I can't sleep without Benadryl. If I go without, I can't fall asleep until around 5am or so. Serotonin doesn't work well, and prescribed medications make me tired all day every night I take it. Does anyone have any advice on prescription dosage or healthier alternatives?
Signal	So I've been sleeping pretty fucking horribly this past month. I've suffered insomnia for a few of years now but it's never been this bad, it's really frustrating tbh.But here's my 2 questions:So I know you mostly grow when you're asleep right, and so I'm barely sleeping, does this mean I might've missed out on my opportunity to grow? Or could I just catch up on later night?Also, caffeine won't affect your sleep if you only take in the morning right?
NotSignal	is there any medication that can help me sleep but it is addictive? ( pls no one suggest melatonin cause it is not working for me)
Signal	I’m so tired and I haven’t slept in two days and it is currently 6 am ;-; idk if I can text memes to my sleeping friends anymore to keep me sane and I can’t fucking sleeeeeeeep
Signal	Depersonalization, dizziness, lightheadedness, and overall just bad memory that developed as a result of insomnia. Not really attentive as I used to be. I was wondering if my brain is permanently damaged from the amount of sleep I have lost in total. If I somehow managed to get my life back on track and sleep good, can these things go away? Is there such thing as too late? Some nights I get 4 hours of sleep, others 6-7, and some nights none. But I’m done. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to get my life back on track. I’m only 18
Signal	So long story short I haven’t been able to sleep through the night for at least the last year or so? I can typically fall asleep fairly easily or if I’m struggling I just take some melatonin and fall asleep but I wake up probably every 1-2 hours per night. It never seemed to effect me but now I’m going through some sort of mental breakdown and I can’t help but think that not being able to sleep through the night has something to play in it. Is this a form of insomnia or something else? What can be done?
Signal	Anyone here ever have one of their sleepless nights, do what you can to fall asleep, fail repeatedly, and call it? Get bored, and message someone in a different time zone, in hopes that you could have a conversation to wile a bit of the night away? The conversation gets going, but that person randomly realises that you should be asleep, says so, and then stops talking to you because they are 'helping' you? Mid-conversation, mid-topic even, for you 'own good?' And should you be sleepless again, they make a note never to reply to the messages you send in that time period? This has happened to me, and it is mighty frustrating. Like, yes I know I should be asleep, but I have also tried everything I can to fall asleep, and yet here I am. But now, I don't even have company. It sucks. It's just another way for someone to say you're doing something wrong, or not trying hard enough, or you aren't being responsible, and they'll have to do it for you. As if ignoring me somehow will send me to sleep, or give me the best chance of it. I wasn't talking to you before, why should it work now? Another way to not be heard under the guise of knowing what's best for me. Like some sort of stubborn kid who won't listen, or something? As you can tell, I feel hurt, and frustrated by this. Because, a part of me wonders if that person is just using me as an excuse not to talk to me, like people have done in the past. "You were feeling down, so I didn't want to ask you if you were okay, and disturb you." "I couldn't talk to you because I didn't know if you wanted me to talk to you." Gosh, don't I feel like crap.
NotSignal	This seems so dramatic I know, but it isn’t, it physically hurts and it’s giving me damn head aches, I don’t know what to do
Signal	I had an nerve njury with a tongue piercing gone wrong with a lot of chronic pain for the 7 months with an increase in excruciating pain in the last month and a half. (So painful I can't concentrate at all.. like on the actual lain scale rating it feels like an 8 and nothing touches it). I've had multiple doctors appointments because I have gone into a pattern of not sleeping at all for 3 days and then maybe 2 hours for 2 days. I dunno it cycles.Doctors also found a small tumour on my mri which is in my brainstem.Literally to help me not have pain and to sleep I have tried napproxen for inflammation, tylenol 3 did nothing, gabapentine I tried once and it just knocked me on my ass. After that I tried melatonin.. that worked for a while and then stopped.Tried antindepressants for a week.. insomnia got worse. Stopped after 5 days by doctors recommendations.I tried zzquil, gravol, benedryl, cbd.Before all the medications I did all sorts of sleep habit health stuff. I exercised, no more caffeine, no alcohol, did hypnosis, did mindful meditation, breathing exercises, warm baths, massages, ughNow I am on prazosin ( just started today because it for ptds and anxiety, even though its a blood pressure med) because its gotten to the point that my fucken heart hurts and my body has an internal burning feeling. My heart rate and breathing are jacked, my brain burns and I have such terror anxiety through my day.I rock when I lay down and pace when I stand. I've been telling people I'm dying because that is 100 percent how I feel.If i do sleep for the measly two hours my body fails hardcore For the love of God save me because life on earth is painful hell right now.What do I do?
Signal	I usually do not drink, but for some reason I did today, the same day I got my sleeping pills that I have to try now. Can I take a sleeping pill? I didn’t drink much, and I threw up after remembering that I can’t drink before using a sleeping pill. :(Thank you
Signal	I’ve struggled with insomnia on and off for years, and right now it’s hitting me hard. I’m in a 4 year teaching program, and I’m currently going through another semester of observation. I’m there the whole day, so I need to wake up around 5am to get to the school on time.I’m so tired of fighting to fall asleep. I don’t enjoy my observation because I’m anxious about falling asleep or exhausted from not sleeping. I don’t want to feel this anxiety anymore. I have BPD, so I struggle with outbursts of rage frequently. I’m punching myself in the face, cutting, or destroying my entire room out of frustration. I can’t do it anymore.
NotSignal	basically i have no friends and I'm up alone all the time. I'd really appreciate some people who would like to conversate this time of night. No sexual stuff, just purely looking to make friends
Signal	I haven't slept in 3 days straight. I am feeling really scared.
NotSignal	Alright, night 2 on new meds. Hopefully its better than last night. Running on 41 hours with on 2 hours of sleep so far.
Signal	Hi. I'm a 14 year old guy with Asperger's and... not a great mental state. A bunch of disorders. As of recent, my symptoms of insomnia returned and it's been difficult.For as long as I can remember, I had trouble sleeping. I'd toss and turn for hours on end, and I'd take roughly one hour to fall asleep on a good day. I've felt tired for as long as I can remember, my sleep never feels "complete". It feels like it's shallow or cut short all of the time and that I wasn't able to appreciate it at all. And I get even more tired than before.Around two years ago, after talking to my psychologist, I was recommended melatonin pills. They worked like *literal magic*. Whenever I took one, thirty minutes later, I was asleep. I began to take less than an hour to fall asleep. But that only lasted so long. They're meant to be taken for two months. I've been hooked on them for two years. But I just can't sleep.Apparently this is becoming common during quarantine, but I've found it more and more difficult to get to sleep and I've had increasingly strange dreams. They've all been so surreal and my sleep's becoming a lot lighter these days. I can't even force myself to do my schoolwork because I'm so tired. Maybe it's lack of exercise? I don't know but I hate it.At this point, don't judge but I'm just going to make myself fall asleep with asmr videos if that still works. Any advice is greatly appreciated, I hope you are all doing well in lockdown.
NotSignal	Though insomnia is considered an illness or inconvenience it might not actually be. According to the Sikh religion and the teachings of Guru Nanak the last hours of night are scared and used for bathing, washing hair, and then meditation, it is a time called Amrit Vela. Some Sikhs (rare) forsake sleeping altogether.
Signal	This has been happening every night for months now. My sleep schedule’s been FUBAR since last July, which has not been helping my insomnia lately but whatever. Every time i lay down to sleep (around 6am-ish) my brain starts shitting out thoughts at a rapid pace, and they all sort of melt together so there’s no way to stop it. I take CBD every night, sometimes enough to knock out a hippo, but it doesn’t help. I used to try the counting down from 100 trick, but lately i can’t even bring myself to attempt it, because i know i’ll just lose track around 80 or so and my brain will move on completely to another topic. Does anyone know a way to break this cycle and get my brain to shut up so i can sleep?
Signal	I sleep alright for the most part but lately I have been having a hard time sleeping. Cant ease my mind that feels like its going 100mph (in thoughts). I don't know.I tried teas, meditation, reading, watching something boring, listen to nature sounds, even asmr and nothing puts me to sleep. Its almost hopeless. In the day I feel like I'm dragging cinder blocks, fatiged, irritated at everyone, no energy. It sucks.
NotSignal	My current sleep schedule is like this - Sleep 2am-5amUp for an hourSleep 6am-10amI work second shift so I try to just let myself sleep when my body lets me but I am increasingly frustrated with not being able to sleep a full 7-8 hours at once. I think about it a lot and feel like I’ve tried everything. Is sleeping like this better than just sleeping two hours or three a day? Or does it not matter? I guess I’m just hoping to connect with those who have struggled similarly.
Signal	Last night I got about 2 hours of sleep, it’s midnight right now and I’m laying down and am going to try sleeping but Im so scared I wont be able to. I ‘m exhausted, but I’ve also been having horrible dreams the past week, so at the same time I’m scared to sleep. Someone please help. Last night I just had my eyes closed for hours until at some point I eventually fell asleep because I had a really strange, realistic dream. I just don’t know what to do to help me sleep. I did take some Benadryl an hour ago.
Signal	It doesn’t have Doxylamine succinate like in the US version, nothing does here apparently except for NyQuil. Instead here Unisom (and all OTC sleep aids) has Diphenhydramine.
Signal	I have lately been experiencing this weird sensation where I wake up right as I drift off to sleep and then I become more aware of my heartbeat and feel like I’m gonna panic, so I wanted to take melatonin and see if it’s safe to take. I think when I got sick recently, my sleep pattern got messed up and my anxiety has just sky rocketed. I hate sleeping at 5:00 am and then having to study for the act for three hours. I’m also 16 hate my anxiety for coming back after four years clean of it :)))
Signal	Hiya,My name is Sam, and I was a shift worker for 3 years, the night shifts absolutely killed my energy levels.It affected my social life and therefore I quit my job.How does poor sleep/insomnia affect your life?
Signal	This whole insomnia thing is...not something I've had to deal with before. Been going on for about a month, and I hate it. I even take medication that has a sedating effect at night. I'd be knocked out by that before. But now...nope. No sleep. Not happening. Theres some irony in the fact that I've had to deal with the complete opposite problem before. Hypersomnia. Sleep 20 hours a day, day after day, still feel exhausted. This is insane. Can my brain just not let me sleep please? I've gotta get up in three hours time.
NotSignal	Melatonin popularity in helping fall in sleep is growing and its not a drug. Your body produces melatonin naturally. It doesn’t make you sleep, but as melatonin levels rise in the evening it puts you into a state of quiet wakefulness that helps promote sleep.Create optimal conditions for it to do its job by keeping the lights low before bed. Stop using your computer, smartphone or tablet—the blue and green light from these devices can neutralize melatonin’s effects. If you watch television, be sure you’re at least six feet away from the screen. Turn off bright overhead lights too.Side effects of melatonin are uncommon but can include drowsiness, headache, dizziness, or nausea.6﻿ No significant side effects have been reported in children.It may cause morning hangover effects if the optimal dose is exceeded, but as it wears off, these symptoms should relent.Melatonin appears to be safe when used short-term, but the lack of long-term studies means we don’t know if it’s safe for extended use.There are no reports of a fatal overdose on melatonin alone.If you have no medical condition this will help you falling sleep much easier and there is no side effects.All the best.
Signal	I've always been someone who needs 10 hours of sleep to feel rested. However, since giving birth last month, I am so ecstatic with 5 hours. Not generally due to baby (well definitely at first) , but because of my insane insomnia. I could never fall asleep and would have constant fight or flight reactions. I got diagnosed with post partum depression 3 weeks ago and was put on Lexapro, Hydroxyzine to help me sleep. Hydroxyzine was helping and I was able to get at least 4 hours and take a nap during the day. I was feeling optimistic and not afraid to sleep any more, until yesterday when I tried sleeping for more than 6 hrs and had Hypnic Jerks every time I fell asleep which would jolt me and wake me up. It was so miserable and I am having a horrible day. I got maybe 1 hr of sleep, and havinf to take care of a screaming baby this sleep deprived is torture. I called my doctor and she prescribed Trazadone and told me to take Magnesium supplements. Magnesium helped me during pregnancy but when I first got diagnosed with PPD, it didn't help at all. The Trazadone I'm weary of because I'm not sure if it helps with the twitches... Like I took 4 Hydroxyzine last night and I was exhausted, and still had the twitches.I just don't get why this is randomly happening. I wasn't anxious yesterday and have been feeling well. This has caused me into a spiral of feeling completely doomed and that I will never sleep again... I don't want to be moving backwards.i feel so depressed today.
NotSignal	I wanted to lose weight so I started eating 500 calories a day, even though the minimum I know is 1200. My insomnia started around this time. Could the calories be why? I get to sleep and then three hours later I wake up. Yesterday I woke up with cold sweats.I am planning to eat loads of food today. Will this help?I will also update in the morning whether this was the cause.
NotSignal	Random text here because the Reddit bots told me this “Your Text Here (optional) is not actually optional.
Signal	been taking melatonin since sixth grade. ran out today and i can’t for the love of me sleep. i’ve been trying for hours, and i just can’t. i hardly slept yesterday and i didn’t sleep at all the day before due to nightmares and it’s looking like i’m not gonna get much sleep tonight either. it’s 8 in the morning and i’ve been trying to sleep since 5:30. nothing is helping, can anyone help at all??
Signal	This past month I’ve gone without quality sleep as some of you may know. I’ve contributed some to the forum. It’s gotten somewhat better and while I still get muscle twitches and headaches they’ve been greatly reduced which is great.Now before all of you go telling me that there’s no way I’ve been experiencing double vision and that’s just blurry vision I want to say I’m quite sure on this. I’ve been having fragmented sleep which I think is a win when compared to no sleep at all but of the few times I wake at night I find myself with double vision. My right eye is just completely off center and it takes a few (10-20) seconds for it to realign with my left. Though it really brings into question whether it’s only a few seconds that I experience it or prolonged periods of time because there’s no real way of telling as I’m asleep with my eyes closed before I’m aware that I’ve experienced double vision. Now, I’ve also gotten the idea of sfi out of my head and I’ve decided it’s just chronic insomnia that I’m experiencing but should this whole double vision thing bring into any concern that I should bring up to a doctor?
Signal	Explain that scientists!!!I missed out on taking my medicine (plaquenil and sertaline). Don't worry, I don't need them to live, but if I don't take them for the evening I wake up weary and feeling weird the next day.
NotSignal	Holy crap. I thought I had it bad, but read many of your stories. I'm 55 and have had insomnia my entire life. Best thing for it has been a weighted blanket. Distant second is bright light therapy. I think it's possible I have mild ADHD as my mind is tough to shut off. Hence, listening to talk radio is better for me than music, because it stops my mind from racing. Hope my experience helps for some. The blanket has been very good for me.
Signal	I hate nights like this. I have a million things to do tomorrow and I can’t sleep. I want to shut my eyes but every time I do, I see him. I haven’t had a good nights rest since before that night and now it just seems like a lifetime ago. My mind is tired. My body is tired. I just want to sleep.
NotSignal	Now and again I’ll have a few good nights of sleep in a row which gives me false hope that I’ve overcome insomnia. After a week of no more than 5 hours sleep per night and having this saga go on for 4 months, I am going to be restricting myself to 5 hours of lying down per day in hope that my alarm actually wakes me up. I have no problem getting to sleep, but staying asleep is a real issue, so hopefully I will see results in a few weeks and can increase my time I allow myself in bed. Only thing I struggle with is not being able to use any screens in the bedroom at all, so I’m going to try and limit it, instead of eliminating it. Sleeping pills are shit and I don’t want to use drugs to help me.Wish my luck insomniacs!
Signal	Just a fun post, but I've had insomnia for 1.5 years and it's centered around being afraid I won't be able to get up for work or I won't sleep and I'll need to call in, or go in on no sleep etc. My job is now forcing me to work from home and I've slept like a baby. This may not be my long term solution but maybe if lasts long enough it will be... Or maybe just get a job where I can WFH full time... lol
NotSignal	I’ve been able to sleep when I don’t look at my clock. When I look at my clock and realise how late it is, the worry reinforces itself in my head, and keeps me up, panicked. Turn your clock away. There’s no point in looking at it anyway. The worry of not being able to sleep is my biggest killer. I also think that it’s a mindset thing - try not to think about sleeping. That keeps you up too. Let your mind drift, if possible. All the counting and breathing exercises did nothing for me, kept me awake even. Need to let your mind drift off naturally, so think about lots of other things, try not to think of sleeping at all. Although, I know it’s hard when you want to sleep so bad. Other advice I got from this subreddit: try to change your mindset by accepting that it is okay to not sleep. Your body will fall asleep eventually, it cannot survive without sleep. Do not worry yourself if you can’t. If you can’t sleep, do something else, make peace with sleeping and with not sleeping. Everything is going to be okay. I hope this helps. Sleep easy my friends.
NotSignal	Is there any reason why I can perfectly fall asleep ASAP but for some reason I wake up at night then can’t go back to sleep at all
NotSignal	Normally I get max 4 hours of sleep at night, but now I haven’t slept in 2 days, took an hour nap this morning, but my mother screams and cries in her sleep as well as arguing with her husband, now it’s become every night and I have to lay in her bed with her and the dog. Idk what to do. Any advice? Normally I’d just lay down under a bunch of comforters with my noise machine, but now it’s not working, my anxiety attacks are more violent and (don’t make fun of me PLEASE,) I have urinated in my bed because of my moms screaming, I couldn’t move. Idk what to do, sorry for the run on sentences, but I’m at a wall rn.
Signal	I can’t sleep like at all. This is my fourth night not sleeping and I have no clue what to do. I’ve tried zzzquil, I tried meditating, melatonin, other sleeping aid pills. Nothing works and I have no idea what to do. Does anyone have any suggestions. I’m desperate at this point. Thank you
Signal	Does anyone else have this certain type of insomnia? I have this “exhausted energy” when I place my head on that pillow. I feel like I have some sort of internal momentum within my head that is just so incredibly uncomfortable. I cant seem to doze off without having to open my eyes every few seconds to brush the feeling, thus pulling me out of potential sleep countless times, a vicious cycle, if you will. Feeling defeated, exhausted, and damn strange. Any thoughts you guys? thanks.
Signal	I’ve had probably one good nights sleep out of a week, and that was only because I took an (over the counter) sleeping pill.What should I do?? I feel both like accepting this is my life now and like I want to cry and kill myself. It is the absolute worst. The insomnia is mainly because of anxiety, but it’s also hormonal which I can do nothing about.I feel like such a failure...
Signal	I just seem to randomly not fall asleep some nights. Like no stress, hyperactive mind/overthinking etc. I’m on long break after finals so I feel especially chill/relaxed. I’ve already tried sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioural therapy but it seems to have no effect—I get my normal good nights of sleep, and the random nights I can’t sleep at all still keeps happening like before(1-2 nights a wk). I go about my day as usual, get lots of light, go gym/track/tennis depending on day, sometimes go out; have dinner at a reasonable time, warm shower, reading until I feel tired. Everything seems and feels normal, but when I hit the pillow, I just lay there sleepy, but awake. No matter what I can’t fall asleep. So random and annoying I’ve ran out of ideas.
Signal	With medication Iv managed to get a decent sleep everynight. Only had 3 hrs sleep today and feel very very tired, but trying to not nap or fall askeep during the day. Whats the earliest youd consider a decent time to fall asleep at?
Signal	I am 21 and I have had trouble sleeping for as long as I can remember due to having such an active mind. Most night I will have 3-4 hours sleep max and try and get to sleep for hours on end. I end up being extremely tired throughout the whole day and have to survive long hours at work and study. But every night, no matter how tired I am throughout the whole day, as soon as I get into bed I am wide awake and it repeats all over again. Does this happen to anyone else, and has anyone tried anything to help. I feel like I’ve tried everything and still fail to sleep which is making it even worse.
Signal	Hey! Long time lurker, first time poster.I have been dx with insomnia for about 3 years now. One thing I haven’t really touched base on with my doctor or psychiatrist is how I feel after I manage to get rest. It never really seemed important but I’m quite curious now. Every 3-5 nights I manage to squeeze in 4-7 hours of sleep here and there- never all at once. 99% of the time, I’m never able to stay asleep. Though, I’ve somehow manages to get a full 8 hours of continuous sleep every other 2 months or so. When I wake up from what this odd “coma” I always end up feeling more tired when I wake up. I’m not sure if my body is just as confused as I am when I manage to get sleep, or if I just want more sleep. I’ve tried sleeping more after waking up but no matter how tired, I couldn’t fall back asleep.Any ideas as to why I enter this coma and why I end up feeling worse when I wake up?
NotSignal	Recently my insomnia went from staying up till 2 when I had it to staying up all night without any sleep.Afterwards I end up not sleeping for the entire day until the evening came around so I don’t disrupt my sleep cycle.
Signal	Honestly don’t know if I’ll be able to go another week working 1st cause I’m having a hard time falling asleep and only staying asleep for maybe 1hr max.. I’m constantly checking the phone to make sure I have enough time to sleep which is bad i know but for some reason I only get tired during the day and at night I’m full of energy
Signal	What's the best alternative to quetiapine (seroquel)? I use it for sleep, but I've been having terrible side effects lately and need an alternative ASAP. I was thinking maybe ambien? Does anyone have any suggestions? It would be much appreciated.
Signal	I work from home and I only feel alive at 3 or 4pm in the afternoon. Any thing you recommend to slowly get things back to normal. I virtually can’t sleep before 4-5 am currently. I also feel very depressed until I get FULLY rested. I’ve tried having a routine, I’ve tried slowly waking up earlier. I feel stuck, like I’m in purgatory.
NotSignal	Recently I just got a puppy. I’ve been going to the dog park every day for 1+ hours the last 2 months. I’d say I’m an active person normally; lifting weights and running on an indoor track as much as I can. Normally the physical exercise isn’t enough to make me tired like you would think, and I resort to other methods like weed and occasionally drinking when it gets bad. I firmly believe that spending lots of time in the sun , enjoying myself, has benefited my sleeping to a large degree. Studies have show spending time in the sun is great for depression/ anxiety, and after the first week, 11pm would roll around and I would be absolutely exhausted. After little bit of meditation, my mental space feels better than it has in years. Anxiety fueled depression is rough. Not sleeping makes you anxious and being anxious prevents sleep. Figure out how to tackle the anxiety part before the sleep and sleep will hopefully follow. Not an expert, just letting you know what has been working for me recently. Good luck guys
NotSignal	Is hypnic jerk mostly due to anxieties or is it part of genetics? Almost everyday I get hypnic jerks now and I do not drink.
NotSignal	I’ve always been a bad sleeper, but I can sleep in a controlled environment. Ear plugs to shut out the noise and I also feel like I need total stillness with no external movement in order to fall asleep. My partner and I have been dating for a couple years now, and I’d always have a tough time getting to sleep because she likes to roll around a lot - but it would never fully prevent me from sleeping as I would drift off eventually, usually after she had fallen asleep. Flash forward to now and the sensitivity has gotten ridiculous. Minor movements are enough to trigger a really strong, immediate adrenaline rush even though I’m fully conscious. This is a very new thing, and I think it’s related to my current stress levels (I’m a PhD student, been getting a paper for submission ready for about a week and a half now). It’s bad enough that I often have to go lie on the couch for a few hours, which is where I’ll usually fall asleep. Does anyone else experience this? I think once I’m done with the paper I’ll take some time off to just chill and get back to normal, but I’d like to try and deal with this better in some way.
NotSignal	does anybody else completely lose their appetite after getting a horrible nights sleep? like i haven’t slept well in 2 days and the thought of having breakfast makes me feel like i’m gonna throw up. yesterday i barely ate all day as well.
Signal	Its is currently 7.20pm and I only got about 3 hours last night. I am tired but my anxiety will probably act up and won't let me sleep tonight as well. When that happens I usually have panic attacks. I don't know what should I do when that happens. Should I just not go to bed? Should I at least rest my eyes and try as hard as I can to sleep? Should I do something like reading or playing computer games or would that be too tiring for me even though it would probably help me not have a panic attack? Sorry I'm about to cry trying to write this. I just want to sleep.
Signal	I’ve had insomnia my entire life, but this is by far the worst bout of sleeplessness I’ve ever experienced and I need advice from anyone who might have had the same or worse experience. I have tried melatonin, z-quil, Benadryl, sleepy time tea, alcohol, and xanax and even with each individually or often a mix of these substances I still do not fall asleep. At all. It’s coming to the point where I’m concerned for my health. I’ve tried different pillows, different sheets, more curtains, ear plugs, breathing and thought exercises, journaling, everything. I have only successfully fallen asleep maybe 6 nights over the last month, and only for a couple hours, if so. The rest of the nights have been me in bed wide awake regardless of how exhausted I am. What do I do? I cannot turn my brain off. Is there anything I haven’t tried? I went to the doctor but all they did was prescribe me Prozac and send me on my way without listening to a word I had to say. Do I need to try a different doctor? Do I need to take the pills? Are there other options? I need help before I completely lose my grip on my sanity. I’m hoping there are some veterans here that know of an answer.
Signal	Hey all, hoping one of you might be able to give me some advice. My doctor prescribed me thorazine for 5 years as a sleeping pill. I'm not bipolar, I legitimately thought he was prescribing me a sleeping pill until the day I decided I didnt need them, stopped taking them, and went through debilitating withdrawls that cost me my job.But anyways, I'm back on the thorazine and working at a much slower taper over a couple of months. But even with the more minor withdrawls I'm experiencing waking me up a lot earlier than intended every morning.So very long story to write why I'm taking benadryl now. If I feel drowsy from the benedryl I can prologue my sleep to 8 hours. The tolerance is the problem though. Only a week, maybe 2 and then I add a pill. By the time I hit 5 I start feeling gunked up and stupid in the head and I'm not willing to go higher, my tolerance adjusts and I'm back to not sleeping.I'd like to find some meds to rotate with the benadryl so I can manage my tolerance. The only thing I have now is ambien which makes me feel like death the next day, and I like to avoid.What about doxylamine? I've never taken it. Could i find an amount that works for me take it for a week than switching back to benadryl for a week? Or are they too similar.Anything else?I realize this is not healthy, I'm just looking for nessacry evil to get me off this antipsychotic no one in their right mind should be on.
NotSignal	So before I start saying everything I need to, my husband made this clear. When you come in here unexpectedly (gameroom) while I’m talking to my friends, saying I can’t sleep. All my friends hear is a 21f not being able to sleep, during a thunderstorm (let alone on her own). I’ll explain more in my background but my husband understands why I have trouble sleeping alone especially when there’s any distractions around me. My background so everyone can understand more. I have a very traumatic past and this has caused me to have MMD, GAD, PTSD, and panic disorder. I also have severe nightmares/terrors and night sweats almost every night. I don’t want to go into great detail but I was abused by multiple people when I was younger including my brother but NOT my parents. I was also sexually harassed, possibly worse. So I have pretty bad memory loss and migraines a lot. I go to several different doctors and have gotten much much better then I was in high school. The one thing that seems to have not gotten better is my sleeping and my anger/manic outbursts. Anyway, I guess my true question on here is what can I do to help myself sleep better and alone, cause my husband comes to bed at least 2-3 hours after me. He doesn’t want to stay in here and help me sleep as much as before (30 minutes to an hour). And he wants me to be able to put myself to sleep without medication that is most likely causing my nightmares/terrors and night sweats to be worse. By the way, I am trying different sleep apps to see if they help, but I can’t get calmed down enough to sleep.Sorry for the long post and probably to much information but I just don’t know what to do anymore.
Signal	After weeks of almost no sleep and tossing in bed, I finally got to sleep properly. I've had insomnia since I was a child, back when I was 10 I still remember struggling to sleep at 1 am even though I went to bed at 9 pm, 3 hours left before having to wake up for school(travel time is really long). Idk if its by coincidence, but I did what is called the "army method" along with the 4-7-8 technique. They say it'd work after 6 weeks of try but I managed to sleep soundly after just 4 days, luckily. I'm on a 2 day streak of a peaceful sleep and I hope it truly was what helped me sleep.Sure it wasn't after 10 seconds immediately like what the method said, but 10 minutes of waiting is MUCH better than hours with me crying out of stress because of no sleep. Here's what I did:Doing the army method twice to sleep before bed, then laying down straight on my back and doing the 478 technique. Then I try not to move for a minute--but if it's really uncomfy I move.I'll probably update
Signal	I went to urgent care because my therapist recommended I tell them what was going on. After going to urgent care they told me I had insomnia which surprised me because I thought that it meant you stay up late and don’t sleep. But yeah it’s been pretty hellish being in a constant state of fog and unawareness I can’t even do or focus on anything and it feels like I’m going insane and my brain is rotting and holy shit this is awful.
Signal	It’s been about two weeks. I’m tired. My body is tired. But I am anxious and as tired as I am, I can’t sleep. I have to be up in 4 hours and work day will drag ass. I kept zoning off at work. I catched myself as a stupid bobble head all damn day. I got 3 hours of sleep the night before and about two the night before that. I haven’t napped in between and I’m so fed up with this stupid disorder.
Signal	I have suffered from insomnia my whole life, have whole rituals for falling asleep, do pretty much all the things recommended, melatonin, blue light blockers, etc. What I don't have is a doctor who treats me explicitly for this. In the course of treating a disease years ago I had a doctor prescribe me some Ambien and I found that helps tremendously, but I'm not supposed to take it regularly. I am no longer under the care of that doc, but I got my PCP to prescribe it, but they do that only on a intermittent basis (they give me 15 pills at a time, I have to go back and beg each time that's used up). I haven't tried any other insomnia medications. I have sleep apnea, but my PCP just ordered a home test for that and prescribed the CPAP when it came back that I had it, so I don't have a specialist following that either.So I'm wondering, do others see specialists for their insomnia? Or are you treated through your PCP? I feel like I need some better options for medication and I'm not sure if I should push my PCP for it or get a referral to someone else.
Signal	Does anyone know from experience how often I can do this without having to “up the dosage”’ I don’t necessarily like weed but I like anything that gets me sleep.
NotSignal	Hey guys and girls, for the past month I have been waking up at the middle of the night for 1-3 times and it's driving me crazy!!I've tried as many tips as possible such as better sleep hygiene recently and it doesn't have much of an effectI don't drink coffee or teaI don't drink alcohol (I'm a minor) I have been quite stressed before although I feel less stress nowI put away my electronics 1 hour before my sleepI haven't tried any supplements but I prefer to avoid them as possible (To be fair, I've only recently started a regular sleep schedule at 10pm when I usually went to bed at around 11.30-12pm, so perhaps it will take time for my body to adapt?)Got any advice? Thanks.
Signal	So for years I have struggled with sleep. I have tried a lot of things for this. A lot of things worked but with side effects. Diphenhydramine (benadryl): definitely works. But it took me like 2 hours in the morning to be fully “awake”Valerian root: didn’t work for me at all. Gave some to my roommate and he slept for 18 hours straight. Alcohol: works very well. Sleep like a baby. Studies say you don’t get a “restful” sleep when drunk...this was not the case for me. I sleep like a baby when drinking. Mentally sharp in the mornings too. Hangovers are rough though, especially during the work week. And it just destroyed my memory. Surprisingly mentally sharp. Just sick and unmotivated. To this day if I am going full insomniac, i will drink 4-5 beers and out like a light. I do not recommend this for a long term solution. Marijuana: this has been very hit or miss with me. Sometimes it keeps me up ALL god damn night. Exhausted but wired. Other times it hits me like a Mack truck and wake up in the morning barely knowing where i am. I do feel hopeful that there is some perfect dose/combo of indica out there for me but I haven’t experimented enough to find it. (Not a big weed guy.)Magnesium (oxide): does not work as a sleep aide. But has a noticeable effect on my muscle relaxation. For me, this muscle relaxation does not put me to sleep. But working in combination something else, it has a nice effect. Which brings us to to the natural sleep aide in the title: MelatoninI tried melatonin for years off and on. It would work but i would feel terrible the next day. Crappy feeling all day. Irritated and irritable. Mood swings. Just REALLY not myself. This obviously made me shy away from it quite a bit. Well, to make a long story short, I have been forced to get my sleep under control. No more 2am or 4am or even sunrise bullshit anymore. I have to be asleep by 12:30 each night. I had to get my shit together. So here i go again...trying melatonin. Scared to death again. But I figured it out. I was taking WAAAY too much for my brain chemistry. I was taking between 5-10mg in the past. Which is a pretty standard dose. I now take 1.25mg. I fall asleep in about an hour to 90 minutes. I don’t feel like crap in the morning. Mix it with that magnesium i talked about earlier right before a HOT shower and boom...you are right on your way to solving a life long sleep problem. Step 2 is never, EVER take a nap. This is the discipline part. You MUST struggle through. This went on for 2-3 weeks before the need to nap feeling goes away. Then it’s smooth sailing!
Signal	Hello, r/insomnia. As of typing, it's 4:47 AM here and I can't sleep again. I was hoping that some of you on this sub can help shed some light on my predicament.So, for a bit of background, I'm the typical gen-z no-lifer who usually goes to sleep at around 3 AM, 5AM if I feel like it. Despite this, whenever I hit the hay and close my eyes, I usually fall asleep pretty quickly, waking up at around 1pm later. In general, regardless of the time of day, if I feel like sleeping, I just close my eyes and I'm dead (VERY useful in College). However, there were really some nights where I couldn't sleep no matter how hard I tried, usually on nights before class for...some reason.Now, as far back as a few weeks ago, there were some days where I had trouble sleeping just like those nights. I would toss and turn until the sun came out, but I would eventually drift off. At most, I would be asleep by 6 AM. But, starting around Saturday (early morning), I had a problem that I found odd: I couldn't sleep. At all. I fell asleep at around 9AM. Sunday early morning, I was able to sleep at around the same time I usually do (3/4 AM). Monday 3/4 AM, I couldn't fall asleep and ended up passing out at around 10 AM. So, Tuesday, same time, I fell asleep. Wednesday, I couldn't sleep again, but on Thursday I was out like a light, and here I am now, Friday morning, wide awake. Essentially, I'm stuck in a cycle of alternating between sleep and no-sleep.I apologize if this seems scattered. My brain is pretty much baked right now. I will ask people later on specifically what days I was awake and days where I wasn't because I usually go down to eat breakfast if sleep eludes me. However, here are other things I have noted:-If I do sleep, it's usually not straight; for example, I go to bed at 3AM, I usually wake up at 5AM, fall asleep again, and then wake up at around 9AM, then sleep, etc. The last two nights where I was able to sleep, this was the case.-I sleep in the afternoons, but it doesn't seem to affect my whether or not I sleep later in the day. On Monday, I slept for a few hours that afternoon but slept pretty fast later that night (tues early morning).-I also attributed this to sugar rush, but I've been eating Oreos and drinking soda late at night for YEARS now and they never affected my sleeping patterns.That's all. Apologies for the long, scattered post. As much as I love staying up, I also love sleep and this is driving me crazy. Would rather know right away if I have some form of insomnia or if my body is just making fun of me.
Signal	Turns out I don't have hyperthyroidism, or at least not anymore, according to the endocrinologist. Now I'm faced with the reality of my situation, and it very well can be the drugs that I am taking. My sleep is currently pretty fragmented and I don't even know how many hours I get a night, but in all honesty it's probably due to Trazodone. I take about 50mg a night with 2mg melatonin, do 4-7-8 breathing, and am able to fall asleep, but I just can't stay asleep! It's all broken and shit and I feel like giving up on it. Plus it gives me palinopsia and fucks up my vision. Is there anything that will help me stay asleep?
NotSignal	I wanted to try this thing called ebbsleep,but it’s only available in America, has anyone seen similar in the UK? Or if anyone has tried it did it help?
NotSignal	I was wondering how everyone manages to pull through the day after a bad night of insomnia? Coffee doesn’t do anything for me and I have trouble taking naps. Are there any supplements or tricks I can try, to give me energy or alertness? Thanks 😴
Signal	Since my breakup with my Girlfriend about 4 months ago, my sleep was absolutely miserable. Couldn't sleep at night because of the constant anxiety and thoughts my head. I tried everything possible to combat this insomnia (no phone before bed, no caffeine at all, limited blue light exposure, melatonin, constant exercise), and nothing worked out... I think for the most part, I got less than 3 hours a sleep a day for about 3 months straight. The night where I did fall asleep, I would wake up in the middle of the night for absolutely no reason and would not be able to fall back asleep. Occasionally, slept debt would "help out" and I would sleep for like 12+ hours for 1 day in 2 weeks... but the following week, I would just go back to shit 2-3 hour sleep days.Until I hit a rough patch a month ago where I just didn't a shit about anything and ate unhealthy and drank beer. I was a very fit individual for most of life up until that point. Ate extremely healthy and exercised and played sports frequently. However, this will sound very stupid, but I felt like being healthy and fit gave me too much energy. Whereas, eating like shit gave me enough food coma to just knock me out at night before my anxiety and racing thoughts could take over. It's going to sound stupid... but at this point in my life, i think i would rather get good sleep and be unhealthy than to not get any sleep at all and be physically fit. I can't stand not being able to sleep.
NotSignal	I consider myself a bit of a night owl. I usually stayed up late (2-3 am), get in bed and fail at sleeping, then wake up with my alarm or if left unchecked 12-2 in the afternoon. However recently because of the pandemic I’ve been staying up later and for a while I even slept later. It would be something like go to sleep at 5 and wake up at 2-4. Now though for the past week I’ve been waking up at 8 am exactly. If I go to sleep at 5 I wake up at 8, if I go to sleep at 2 I wake up at 8. It seems like no matter what I wake up at 8 and I’m just not tired anymore.
NotSignal	I'm taking a break from smoking weed (thc oil carts) and I started 4 days ago. Im also on sprinting break/quarantine which is also probably affecting my sleep.Every night for the past 4 days I've been up until like 7 am not being able to sleep. I just lay in bed for hours trying to sleep till cant. Any tips on how I can get back to a regular sleeping schedule
NotSignal	I am so tired but I can’t fall asleep. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. This has never happened to me before. I started throwing up an hour ago. I feel so sick. I’m so tired but when I close my eyes nothing happens. I’m sorry you have to deal with this all the time but I have never experienced this before. It’s been 2 days, and nothing is helping. What do I do? Please help me
Signal	since quarentine started ive been staying up til 9 am. ill turn around multiple times and not find a comfortable spot. if i do sleep ill wake up and not be able to fall asleep again. i even stayed up a whole day. its been happening often. i tried sleeping early but i just wont fall asleep. i tried tried multiple things online. ive been feeling more sensitive and feeling stressed. not wanting to do anything. im not like that. im about to start school tomorrow and have to wake up at 7 am. do i need to get this checked?
Signal	For the past possibly 5 months I’ve had on and off hallucinations before falling asleep at night. My sleep schedule is everywhere but I end up always having a very deep sleep. I’ve had some weird visual and audio hallucinations happen before falling asleep in the past and a couple experiences with sleep paralysis, as well as quite a few lucid and hyper realistic dreams, but the other night when I fell asleep, I had a dream where I woke up in my bed very groggy and limited to making sense of my surrounding almost as if it was hard to be consciously present. Once I woke up in my dream I heard birds chirping outside my window and so I thought I may be half awake or trying to wake up from my dream. Still dreaming I got up from my bed and started to notice knocking on my walls, almost similar to if you ever had a wood pecker outside your house. I’ve had them before so I think part of me was trying to rationalize the noises. After a certain point the noises got unsettlingly uncomfortable and I was almost internally arguing with myself to as if I was in a dream or not. I woke up not too long after. That was a little bit of a frightening experience however before I fell asleep that night, I’d got a visual hallucination while off in a train of thought. It was imagery of me but what I’d expect myself to look like in the future but almost symbolically not the image I’d want, it was unsettling as well and looked almost as if something I’d be afraid of becoming, but also very unrealistic. I’ve seen a lot of this type of imagery before while trying to fall asleep, some of it I’m able to make sense of and relates back to different situations or things that relate to my life however some of the time I’ll get intense imagery that looks very familiar but I never recall ever seeing anywhere, the one thing that all the imagery and audio hallucinations I see is that they all hold some sort of feeling inside them that is very familiar, and sometimes unsettling. For imagery that I don’t recognize, It still feels like part of me recognizes it deeply but the more I ponder what it was the more I’m only able to visualize the image of it which makes it feel less familiar as if the more I try to make sense of what I’m seeing the less sense it makes. When I used to have these types of experiences sometimes I’d hear a loud noise accompanying it which would wake right out of whatever state of consciousness I was in. My freakiest experiences with falling asleep is when I’d begin to fall asleep with something playing in the background on my computer and I would begin to listen to it until I dozed off, until I’d stop hearing the audio while still being awake. It was almost a comfortable state to be in but sometimes I’d realize that the audio wasn’t playing and open my eyes to turn it back on and I would start to hear it again and realize it was on. Another time I was listening to a guided meditation and I felt like I was starting to fall asleep and when I came back from the meditation it would have felt like I was in a deep state for a long time, however the amount of time passed in the guided mediation was very short when I was conscious in reality. Probably one of the most terrifying experiences I had is when I was falling asleep one night listening to a podcast on my computer and I started to lose consciousness and it felt like I was falling out of my body slowly and then my internal dialogue merged with the speaker in the video so it sounded almost like my voice was speaking to myself through the audio of the speaker in the podcast. This has happened a couple times however it hasn’t happened in a couple months. Every time I’d experience that I’d wake up a little panicked with my adrenaline running and would have to wait a bit before falling asleep again because it felt as if I was being pulled back and immersed into that. It was an odd sort of feeling accompanying it sort of like an absence of something. ! I also forgot to mention that maybe a few days ago while trying to fall asleep I got in this deep state in which I felt this bad feeling about to approach me but my inner dialogue or some sort of collective of thought or understanding told me to push through the feeling and it felt like the bad feeling almost broke apart, I don’t know if this is some form of disassociation, I’m not worried about it but it was pretty interesting to me and after it happened I woke up and tried to think how’d I’d be able to do it again if it happened.Thank you for listening, I lucid dream fairly often and have been semi lucid dreaming for the past week or two with some pretty interesting dreams, any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated !
Signal	yesterday: new years day. holiday. woke up at noon.today is no holiday.tomorrow is no holidaynot even sleepy now. gonna be sleepy in the morning i guess.insomnia causing depressiondepression causing insomniai think this thing is called a positive feedbackim not positive about this
Signal	so for about the past 2 weeks - week and a half i have been waking up from nightmares at 2 in the morning and 6. every time right around those times, sometimes more frequent than other nights. anyways i have recently started taking melatonin 10mg to help but even they don't work anymore. the dreams are usually me running or fighting or being jumped by someone usually people i know and every time i'm hit and try to defend myself it's like i can't hit them back but they can continuously hurt me. it's gotten to the point i don't want to sleep much and if i do, after the first time i wakeup in the night i'm afraid to go back to sleep. does anyone have any insight on this type of thing or can maybe recommend sleeping medication. i'm not sure if this has anything to do with it but i've been a pretty heavy smoker probably 3-6 bowls a day but i have stopped smoking in the past couple days and i've also quit smoking cigarettes less than a month ago. any answers would be very appreciated.
NotSignal	I can't sleep. Maybe an hour or two a night. I have to drop out of DEP for the military because of it despite already selling my house to go to bootcamp. Developing insomnia this past year literally ruined my life. I enlisted thinking it would be temporary but it doesn't end. Everyone I talk to makes it worse.They say the dumbest shit likeJust stop thinking about itTry medicationJust lay down and close your eyesAre you sure you're tired?Just relaxThe list goes on. Have you given up on trying to open up to people about it?
NotSignal	Four walls, no calls but the moonlight creeping through the blinds, ceiling fan on high spinning I’m beginning to believe that tonight is the night.Dead by dawn I’ll shred my palm to the end of my arm I’m spread and gone, embalmed, Put me in the earth where I belong.
NotSignal	I'm relatively new to this concept... My mom has always been a turbulent sleeper since she gave birth (anxious about her children) and she's had trouble sleeping since (now in her 50s and finally sleeping better) and I had a friend once with sleep paralysis and insomnia but I didn't think to ask a bunch of questions because I've ALWAYS been a heavy-sleeper. Out like a rock, my mom would say...But since moving home (maybe 4 months now) I've been having trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep... I haven't changed anything in my life other than my diet (I'm gluten free now) but I don't know why I'm not sleeping?I take melatonin every few nights just to get SOME sleep but I'm wondering about other alternatives?
NotSignal	I haven’t slept since New Year’s Eve it’s December 33
NotSignal	This sucks.. how long has it been since you “think” you slept. I say think because I know some of us sleep very lightly and we count is as sleep anyway because ... well it was something... so how long has it been for you guys ? I’m pretty sure I haven’t slept properly in days maybe 4 hours ... sucks ...
NotSignal	I want to try every other avenue to find sleep before I seek professional help and everyone keeps telling me "just exercise it'll make your body tired". So I'm going to try that in the morning, if I get any sleep tonight.
Signal	Hi, it's 5am of course and I haven't slept yet. I have insomnia. Sometimes when I try to sleep I will sleep for a bit, then all of the sudden I will hear some annoying sound and I will wake up. It's always sounds I find really really annoying. It's like my brain tries to purposely make me hallucinate the most annoying sound to keep me up.I have a weird problem where continuous repeated sounds feel like torture to me.. I won't go into detail, but it's a result of lifelong trauma.Today I got baby chicks, and I love chicks and all. But they chirp... A lot. So as I keep trying to fall asleep, I keep hearing baby chicks chirping.Idk why I'm posting but I'm just annoyed.
Signal	First time posting and of course it's midnight.I am just at that point where I wouldn't mind the night terrors and sleep paralysis. I just want to sleep.I'm so tired I feel physically sick and have like a chest collapsing feeling.Any one else?
NotSignal	woke up this morning feeling like I was gonna vomit. head pounding headache. body all shaky. very tired and low mood. thought it was covid at first lol but i actually think it’s because of sleep deprivation. anyone else experience this?
NotSignal	I thought my body would give up by now, but I guess not. So how are y’all doing?
NotSignal	Have been dealing w/insomnia for a year and a half now. Recently had an organic acids test and a stool test done and they found I had an overgrowth of fungus and parasites in my gut. It also showed that I had 3x the maximum acceptable amount of Oxalates in my urine. Oxalates have been proven to wreak havoc on the body, as well as induce anxiety and insomnia. It’s also been shown to be increased by certain fungus species. So I started antiparasitic medication as well as antifungals and after 3-4 days I am sleeping so well now. I encourage you guys to rule out a gut issue. There has been growing evidence of the mind-gut connection.I know this sounds like a bunch of wacky science but after suffering for so long, I am glad I have found a solution!
Signal	Been dealing with crappy sleep my whole life. It's kind of a joke in our family that my mom used to beg me to take naps/go to sleep when I was little! I finally am properly medicated (for other stuff too, mostly MDD and GAD), which wasn't easy (1) because finding the right cocktail is an art and (2) I can't take anything that could be abused (I'm recovering).&#x200B;Aside from the occasional bout of insomnia or night terror, I've been lucky to sleep well for the better part of my 20s. Like so many others, this whole pandemic thing has me spiraling. For the first time in years, I can't sleep more than 4-5 hours. I'm up until usually 3-4 am and then sleep until 8:30 or so. I know I should be grateful just for that, but I am so fed up. Anxiety keeps me up, and I feel like I can't breathe. My mind is racing. Meditation tapes and "rescue" medication helps, but even that is starting to lose its effectiveness.&#x200B;I know I'm far from the only person going through this, so I just wanted to vent to people who understand it. I'm just so freaking tired and anxious. Makes me miss depression naps/sleeps, which I never thought I'd say lol. Also my country is batshit right now, which doesn't help. I'm always afraid of what off the wall shit is going to be ordered next. &#x200B;/rant : )
Signal	I can’t sleep. It’s been months since i’ve had a good nights sleep, months. It’s been months since i’ve slept before sunrise. I have no sleeping pattern, schedule. My ability to sleep is too fucked for it. I’ll go hours without being able to sleep at night, then when i do, i’ll wake up in the morning feeling exhausted. I’m constantly tired. But i can never sleep. The longest i’ve gone without sleep is around 46 hours, couldn’t sleep all night so ended up staying awake the full day, still didn’t fall asleep until around 5ish am the next night. I don’t know why my sleeping is so fucked. I don’t think it’s anything like insomnia, i feel it would be more severe. I got sleeping pills to try fix my sleep i managed to fall asleep using them a few times, however other times they just wouldn’t work, i’d still lie awake sleepless. My lack of sleep is probably the primary cause of my lack of motivation and happiness.Has anyone experienced this? Or know what i could be going through?
NotSignal	TLDR: waking up very early with a dry mouth, dry tongue and a really weird swelling throughout my body.Context: 15 year old male, generally in good shape. My diet is fairly healthy and I work out regularly. I have been extremely stressed and sleep deprived lately and I also have a history of insomniac periods within the last few years. Never as a young child (read: before high school.)Now, I’ve been stressed out with school and as a result, haven’t been getting enough sleep for the past few weeks. Within the last week, I’ve started waking really early on holidays (6 am ish) with a dry throat and a weird feeling in my mouth. There’s also this reaaaallly weird feeling in my head and throughout my body, almost like everything is swelling up. I feel like a fucking machine booting up. It only lasts for a few seconds (happens in the middle of good dreams) and I wake up without fail. The weirdest fucking thing is, this bullshit doesn’t happen when I need to wake up for school. It’s only happened during these first few days of summer break.Help. Me. I am half dead.
NotSignal	One night, on 18 or 20th of April i was sitting in my bed, and all of a sudden, my heart started to beat very fast. I started to panick more and more with every second that was passing and I couldn't control my fear because this never happened to me before. Then, my heart started to beat so fast that i felt like i was going to faint. It was the worst feeling ever. I started to think that i'll have an heart attack or something. I've called an abulance but they only helped me calm down through the phone because they've told me it's nothing serious. After that day, I started to have palpitations throughout the day and more often and stronger everytime i was going to bed. I was afraid to go to sleep because i didn't want to experience this again. Also, that fear feeling was stronger because I was living alone due the fact that I was at the university. On 23th of April i had very strong palpitations again and I've called the ambulance again. At the hospital they've made an EKG and the doctor told me that it's nothing serious and my heart is ok. The doctor told me to take some magnesium and to try sleep better. He also told my that this may occured because I'm stressed and I didn't make any physical activity because I was staying at home for about 2 months due this corona virus isolation. That didn't calm me at all because i was still having palpitations. On 28th of April I came back yo my hometown because the univeristies got closed and things seemed to get better. I've struggled to go to bed before 2 am but after seeing that this feeling is going away, i started to stay up more late. These days, in the last 2 weeks, I'm going to bed around 3-4 am. I can't sleep because i still have this anxiety that doesn't let me chill. Last night I had palpitations again. I figured out that they occur when i'm sitting in bed. They trigger when i move or change my position in bed, or when it's quiet. I don't know how to explain but i always need to keep myself busy pr distracted. I'm afraid to go to bed because when it gets quiet, I can't stop listening to my heartbeat and my brain automatically starts filling my mind with bad thoughts about that. I also figured out that if it gets past 3 am, the palpitations occur more often. It's like my palpitations trigger if my eyes see that its getting late. How do i get rid of this?
NotSignal	Hey everyone . Just have a few things on my mind I’d like to talk to people about . I havent slept in about 40 or so hours now and it’s because I get wayyyy to hot in bed . If my room isn’t literally around 0-5 degrees Celsius I cannot sleep . Even nights like tonight which is about 15 degrees Celsius make me way to hot and uncomfortable . I have a fan on me at all times , window open , etc... (can’t afford air con in my room) it’s slowly been getting worse but it seems this has peaked it . I just sit in bed getting hot flushes over and over and start to sweat. Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this just so I can fall asleep ? Thankyou .
NotSignal	Guess I’ll just stay awake for my physical therapy that start in three hours. Cause we all know that sleeping for only two hours will make the exhaustion worse (if I could even fall asleep).
Signal	When I get into bed most nights I'm asleep with 5 minutes, 15 minutes on a bad night. I put it down to diaphragm breathing. My major issue is I always always wake up in the middle of the night, when I do it's touch and go whether I even get back to sleep.It's so frustrating to be in bed nice and early at 9 pm only to wake up at 11pm and not sleep for the rest of the night.What techniques do you use to fall back asleep when you wake in the middle of the night?
NotSignal	I have a fun combo of insomnia and hypersomnia. Meaning, it takes me forever to fall asleep (1-2 hours on a good night, which don’t happen often. Usually more like 2-3 hours). But once I fall asleep, I’m out for 10-14 hours and no less. Otherwise I cannot function. It’s brutal. Does anyone have any advice for falling asleep for a sleep study? I have one tonight and I feel like I’m going to be up all night and have no results.
NotSignal	I never post in reddit but now this is one of the last sources I have. Today I had the most extreme day-long caffeine overdose, I jittered all day after not sleeping for a whole night because I woke up at 11PM after snoozing for too long after also doing an all nighter. Now I've gotten about 6 hours of sleep after consuming Doxylamin for the caffeine-induced anxiety attack I had. While sleeping I've had nightmares I couldn't difference between reality. I have no idea what to do now that I've woken up and I still feel nausea from the coffee. Before this all nighter craziness I remember sleeping about 12-14 hours a day.Now I can barely concentrate to close my eyes. I literally feel like im having a psychotic episode. Is this going to damage me long term mentally?
Signal	Anybody experience the same issue? I feel tired and sleepy but couldn’t fall sleep when I actually in bed
Signal	So I’ve had sleeping problems ever since I can remember, I have never been on any medications for sleep. When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I was put on Seroquel. I’ve been on Seroquel for 2 years and sleep through the night because of it. Am I still an insomniac???
Signal	(Reposted from r/sleep. I really feel like I need help.)Hello. I'm an 18 year-old guy and over the past week, I observed I've been sleeping for only 4 hours maximum every evening. I can sleep from 9 to midnight, but I always keep waking up exactly 4 hours later.Then there's a sleepless period (usually from very early morning until late morning) where I end up not being able to sleep until 7+ hours of being awake.Yesterday, I napped again at 11AM to make up for my 4 hours of sleep, only to wake up at 5:30PM. So I am under the impression my sleep schedule is reversed--where I only "nap" for 4 hours in the evening and sleep very soundly in the daytime.How do I go back to a more conventional sleeping schedule? School will start soon for me. I have a history of having weird sleeping schedules (i.e. sleeping for only 6 hours for 5+ years, napping during all car rides, etc.) and how my schedule changed during the quarantine that I can go into if you want more info, but that's my story for now.What should I do? I've tried sleep hygiene and small doses of melatonin nightly, but I'm still at a loss.
Signal	I like to think about things and get lost in my thoughts quite a bit...which has led me through very long periods of insomnia at night. Fast-forward to my senior year of university and I’ve actually gotten around to taking melatonin, but the dreams/ nightmares that I have are...probably best not repeated in polite company. The bright side is that my mind works weird so it’s more of an annoyance to me than anything else; it’s good material for my poems and stories though.
Signal	Ambien used to work like a charm for 7 months, my dosage was 5mg and now I need to take 10mg, sometimes 12.5mg.My doctor switched me to 12.5mg Amytriptyline, it did not put me out. Next is 25mg Seroquel, it gave me racing heart rate and I could not sleep as well (but I felt tired).I am thinking of trying Gabapentin next, is this stuff dangerously addictive like Phenibut? And is there a difference in quality on Sensoril vs generic Gabapentin?Thanks and may you all have a good sleep!
Signal	So I have a prescription of seroquel from a couple months back and since then I’ve switched to trazodone which is good but not great.My problem is about 3-4 hours ago I took my last 2 trazodone (100mg total) and I’m still wide awake pacing around with nothing to do. I still have a couple hundred mg of seroquel and I’m wondering if taking 50-100mg of thag would be safe on top of the trazodone 100mg?I NEED SLEEP AHHH
NotSignal	any of u guys manage to exercise with little sleep?if yes any tips ? i really need to start
Signal	It's pissing me off.My body logically requires more sleep yet it wakes up and refuses to fall back. Why?
Signal	tw// mention of sexual assaultI am a 24 F and I think I struggle with anxiety related insomnia. I have not been officially diagnosed nor am I looking for an unofficial source to diagnose me. I’m wondering if my symptoms are similar to anyone here. No matter how hard I try I cannot set a regular sleep schedule with myself, and quarantine hasn’t made it any easier. 3/22 I woke up at 11am, because I’m trying to get up earlier so I can have some kind of normalcy. Well last night I stayed up until 10am and napped on and off until 2pm just to get some kind of sleep. Last night my anxiety was definitely triggered because for whatever reason I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me. For whatever reason my brain immediately kept thinking that someone was going to break into my house & that led to me reliving my sexual assault years ago. Needless to say I couldn’t fucking sleep. Tonight I’m exhausted. Like many other nights I lay in the most comfortable position I can and have laid here for about 2.5 hours with my eyes shut trying to sleep. Nothing. Even when my head is clear my body just won’t sleep. What are your experiencing with this? Or how does your insomnia differ from this? Did you get diagnosed for insomnia or do you assume/self diagnose? Was it through your primary care dr or therapist? I’ve always had trouble sleeping, even as a kid without a phone. I just never thought to bring it up to a professional until recently and I’m curious about the process since it’s uncharted territory. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to hearing your insight!
Signal	Hello, Sorry for the long post. Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist so this is just a theory.This past week entirely I had insomnia, because I reverted my usual sleep pattern during the holidays (binge watching Netflix and overnight gaming) causing me to stay awake at night and fall asleep in the morning approx 06:00 AM until approx 14:00 PM or so. But when work days came, and I had to get back to my schedule of waking up for work at 05:30 AM, needless to say it did not work out that well. What followed was an entire week without sleep which I used to do a lot of research on how I can get back my sleep, whats going on, lots of reading, reddit, science websites, etc, so I felt I should give back to the community about my findings. I was also in the ER during the week, since I thought I felt some heart palpitations about the 3rd day of lack of sleep - I was assured that the EKG looks "great" and had other specific blood tests and such and was told that there is nothing wrong and I should investigate somewhere else. My manifestation of insomnia was: \- inability to sleep the entire night\- absolutely zero yawning even after days of sleep deprivation\- at midnight, when I was laying in bed, my body was getting very warm causing me to not be able to close my eyes\- constant fear of "oh god, not again, I cannot sleep, this cannot be possibly happening this night too, where is the end"I started reading, learned about proper sleep hygiene, supplements e.g. magnesium, zinc etc, but more importantly the "fight or flight" mechanism controlled by the CNS (Central Nervous System) which was saving our lives, ever since we were hunting in groups, in the beginnings of mankind. For the past 2 years I've lived in Sweden and in a sort of remote city, nothing much to do here, so I pretty much isolated myself from social interaction, little by little. I only interact with work colleagues. So yesterday I had the idea - "OK, if belonging in a pack was so important for the brain to feel safe in the past, maybe I just need some social interaction too, I mean I have tried everything already". So I made a video call with my friends back home and we just talked and had laughs for 3 hours. What happened last night? SLEPT LIKE A NEWBORN, finally!!!! After a week of agony and painful desperation. So maybe for me, that was the missing factor. I took my magnesium and zinc pills before sleep, but also used lighter clothing than previous nights, due to learning that body temperature needs to be cooled down for sleep, and dipped a piece of cloth in cold water and left it overnight on my forehead.&#x200B;TL,DR - When you are restless and can't sleep at all, take your "social interaction pill" too, along with your magnesium - interact with your friends for multiple hours - just chill together for a couple of hours, have some laughs together. I believe that the 3 hour discussion I had with my friends back home "saved" me, I think the lack of social interaction causes the body to feel in a constant state of alertness - my theory is that, being alone for such a long time, and not interacting with anyone tells the body there is "no one to watch your back", so you need to be EXTRA alert, raising anxiety as a response, thus triggering the whole mechanism of raised blood pressure, body temperature, etc.I hope this will be useful to someone.
Signal	I’m new to this sub and new to the diagnosis of insomnia. I have chronic migraines and my neurologist diagnosed me with insomnia. She thought that treating the insomnia would help the migraines, so I tried Lunesta (didn’t work) and Gabapentin (didn’t work, we went up to 600 mg/day). I’m still on the Gabapentin because she thought it might be helping with my pain, but it didn’t affect my sleep at all. So now I’m on Ambien CR (started at 12.5 mg/day but went down to 6.5 mg/day). For reference I’m 19F 105 lbs and I’m on a lot of other meds. The higher dose made me feel too tired during the day and like I was high/drugged up 24/7. I’m worried that my doctor has no plans of taking me off these meds as long as it’s helping me sleep. Has anyone been on Ambien long term? I’m definitely used to my dose now and getting ready to bump up to 12.5 again. TIA.
Signal	Hello, so essentially I have had insomnia for close to 10 year now. Nothing seems to work, and ambien which does help me fall asleep also leads me to drink alcohol I don't remember drinking or message a bunch of people word salad.The hst will set me back $300 but at this point I'm willing to try anything. Has anyone tried this? Hopefully nobody responds, because as we know the cured don't post here.
NotSignal	It's almost 4 where I am. A mix of insomnia and chronic health issues have me up. And I need to meet with a professor at 11, doctors at 2:30, and work at 4:30Why is this life
NotSignal	I finally started fixing my sleeping schedule and I'm waking up after 6 hours. I just woke up an hour ago at 4am and I don't like it. I can't make myself go back to sleep.Is my body trying to adjust?
Signal	I’ve always struggled with insomnia. It usually gets worse when I’m stressed. Recently I lost my job and because of the stress from that, I can’t sleep. AT all. I can take short naps during the day. I don’t feel tired until about 6-8 am. I’m running on fumes, I’m exhausted, and I feel like I’m going nuts. Benadryl, zzquil, etc won’t work on me, sleeping medications and sedation don’t work so they’re out of the question. Is there anything else I can do or am I SOL?
Signal	For whatever reason lately my anxiety has been in overdrive and I haven’t slept in days. I fall asleep for about 2 or 3 hours (not even deep sleep at that) and then I’m wide awake.Has anyone tried a weighted blanket for sleeping? If so what was your experience? Did it help or was it just hot and hard to move?
NotSignal	I have trouble sleeping since May 5th this year, every damn time I go to sleep around 10:30 PM, and when I (as usual) am unable to fall asleep literally hours go by like minutes. I was feeling like I was struggling for 15 minutes or so, but when I looked at the time 2 hours passed. How.
NotSignal	Hello guys.I'm an interactive design student, and my group and me are working on a project based on insomnia. I would like to ask your opinion about some statements that we defined.&#x200B;1. Do you ever feel alone when you wake up during the night ?2. If yes, would you like to discuss / communicate with others people that are currently facing the same problem ?3. Do your relatives know about your sleep problem ? Do you talk to talk to them about it ? Is it hard ?4. Do you sleep more / better in other place that your bed ?&#x200B;Thanks for your help !
NotSignal	I have anxiety about tomorrow. Why is it after I get back to sleep and wake up it’s like it’s almost all erased? I just wake up and I have more energy than I need to face the things that were stressing me so badly the night before.
Signal	I’ve already posted this on the r/sleep subreddit but I figured it was good to get your opinions as well.So, for the past 4 days or so, I haven’t gotten a lot of restful sleep. To be expected, this has had a massive toll on the way I am. I can’t think straight, my mind feels cloudy, I’m dizzy, and headaches are more common. In addition, my memory is a bit off. I really don’t want to go another day like this. I’ve tried a few things, none of which work. I’ve tried Sleepytime Tea (Extra with Valerian), actual sleeping pills (Diphenhydramine HCl), relaxation/mediation methods and white noise. I know the best option is a doctor but for a short term, what should I do? Should I try ZZZQuil (it’s Diphenhydramine, which didn’t work the first time), any other sleep aids or should I skip right to melatonin?
Signal	My doctor just prescribed me trazodone to sleep. I have never taken it before and the only other medication I’ve taken for sleep is Benadryl but I’ve built such a high tolerance that it never works. He wants me to take 100mg but I’m afraid of how I’m going to first react to it. Should I cut it into quarters and start with a 25mg tonight?Let me know your experiences on it please.
NotSignal	I‘m trying to sleep for nearly six hours now. I recently found out that listening to documentaries on YouTube helps me fall asleep, but today that doesn’t seem to work. My wife is sleeping soundly next to me, and I am so jealous. She just lies down, and bam - within ten minutes she’s asleep and doesn’t wake up until the alarm goes off. I‘m so tired and cranky.
Signal	It was few years ago. Maybe three or four, it was the the worst time of my insomnia which has been suffocating me for six years now. Then, I was unable to get any prescription medication due to me being underage and to get to a children psychiatrist would require me to drive for hours to get there and my family was very poor at the time so all I had was melatonin, which I had to take at least a whole jar to rest for half an hour.I can't really remember how long I wasn't sleeping at that time, for sure I was hallucinating so perhaps four or five days. My parents didn't really understand what I've been going through so smashing cabinets in the middle of the night wasn't something they were careful about.But then, I felt that wonderful feeling like I'm swaying and falling, which always tells me I'm falling asleep. But then my cat, which I love above anything else jumped on my desk causing A LOT of noise which pulled me from getting relief. Something snapped inside of me. All I could think about is getting rid of any source of sound and noise. To destroy it. I grabbed my cat and held it really close to me, rather tight. I had to get rid of her, smother her and then I could sleep. She wasn't screaming, she wasn't biting or scratching, just began wiggling indicating she wants to go already. Then I came to my senses. What the fuck was I doing? Did I really want to suffocate the being I raised since when she was just four weeks old, the only thing that kept me alive?I started crying, shrieking like a banshee, trying to get her to understand that I didn't mean it, but she didn't seem hurt or angry, just confused.But, after all these years, with my condition improved due to the right medication and me being in a good place in life, I still get dreams of her lifeless body in my arms and her matte golden eyes looking empty at the ceiling, my fingers covered in blood from her tiny mouth. The thought, that even for these few seconds I wanted to kill her just to sleep haunts me to this very day. I know that most likely I was experiencing psychosis and my brain wanted to defend itself no matter what cost and I wasn't thinking straight. But, in her eyes, I was like her mother, when she got to my house the very first day I took her to my bed despite my parents' opinion on it just so she wouldn't be scared, I fed her, I was running with her in my arms without shoes to the vet when we learned of her heart condition and she was suffocating because of it. She meant the world to me and I wanted to end her life, even if it lasted just a second.That's why I can't forgive myself.
NotSignal	Have had a bout of low-quality sleep of between 3 and 5 hours for a couple days now.I look at my FB memories and the same thing was happening this time last year and a couple years ago too!This has happened before, too, in different months.Any ideas why this happens? I will say that the same things are not happening year after year. By that I mean there's nothing repetitive in my personal or professional life that always happens around this time.
Signal	2.30 amSoo, my tired and sleepless, but ingenious brain provoked HUNGER. Laying in warm bed in fluffy onsie with my teeth washed waiting for a decent sleep, and I know if I don't get up to eat, I will never fall asleep hungry!!Do you have sudden insomnia eating urge?
NotSignal	My girlfriend is asking me at this point to physically knock her out. Obviously not gonna happen. Anyone got any tricks they can share yo help their partner sleep?
Signal	I never had an issue with insomnia until January this year caused by general anxiety. I had a horrible time. I got over it by using a book called the sleep book. It basically teaches mindfulness and Act therapyI sleep every night now but not without tremendous anxiety about bed as soon as it starts to get dark. I hate going to bed and I would say fear it.Does this fade away gradually or what? I don't know why I still suffer this as I sleep with no issue now.
NotSignal	LAst week I was getting 4 to 5 hours of sleep now I’m every 2 hours... 😧
NotSignal	Now I've made a post here before and if anyone cares I'm able to use my phone again (I can technically still use it when I'm not allowed but it just means I can't sleep cause I can't listen to my videos that help me sleep) However a mix of nightmares, migraines and anxiety mean I still haven't slept. I think I'm on 48 hours so not too bad but it means the migraines are getting worse and mix that with my bad knee that means that I cannot walk for extended periods of time or else I'll get a bad migraine which causes me to lose balance and my vision and my knee will probably give causing me to fall over (almost did while shopping earlier. I have a death wish by traveling alone all the time) so in other words I'M SCREWED! I also get very angry and very sad when I'm sleep deprived so BRING ON THE TEARS!! I apologize for anyone reading this. This Is just for me to vent.
NotSignal	Ever feel so tired to the point where you are head bobbing, your eyes keep closing, and yet you are unable to fall asleep? Honestly I think that feeling is worse than being wide awake.
Signal	I didn't sleep at all last night (anxiety). I managed to get to sleep this evening only to wake up 2.5 hours later. I am so fed up of this! I'm shattered but my brain just won't let me sleep. At this point, I'd be prepared to pay someone to hit me over the head with a hammer! F-off brain!
NotSignal	For those of you who do/did CBT and had success, what are your results when traveling? I'm starting CBT tomorrow, and from what my beginner mind sees, is that by setting up a pattern to help you sleep, you may have a hard time sleeping once you're in a new place without your normal patterns?
NotSignal	I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask for help but I'm really desperate. My mom used to take antidepressant, she cut them off 10 years ago. She now still struggles with sleep. She wakes up every night at 2 AM and stays up the whole night. She only gets 3 hours of sleep every day. Today she acted really weird. She said it's because she hasn't slept the whole night.I want to help my mom really really bad. She's always on her phone or tablet before she goed to sleep. She usually listens to podcasts (a lot of them are really sad and negative). She used to take Melatonin tablets but says they don't work. I was thinking maybe she should read a book before going to sleep instead of going on her phone or something? What can I do to help her?
Signal	Hi there, I have been dealing with chronic insomnia for about a week and a half. It started with having fragmented sleep with waking up 2 or 3 times during the night and not being able to sleep past 7 or 8 in the morning (whereas before I was sleeping until 10 am). Now it's gotten worse - I sleep for one or 2 hours, wake up, then manage to get maximum 3 more hours in and then I am wide awake and have to start my day. During the day I feel quite tired and sleepy and I've tried 2 different antihistamines but no results. I am at a point where I'm so exhausted and sleep deprived that I feel like I'm ill. I have no racing thoughts, worries or anything and most of the time I can fall asleep. I have tried keeping myself busy, moving a lot, all those sleep hygiene tips but nothing worked and I keep waking up after one or maximum 2 sleep cycles. Has anyone else faced this before? Thanks.
Signal	Tbh, I probably shouldn’t have taken it for a year. My pysch always said it was much safer then benzos and what not. Turns out it’s very similar to a benzo apart from the name. Kinda worried about coming of it. Any advice or experiences?
Signal	Currently I go to bed at 11:00 and I get up at 4:30, I want to stay in bed and sleep until 6:00. They say I need to stay in bed until about 6:00 so I can set that as my rhythm but how can I do that if I can't sleep past 4:30?
Signal	You know it’s rough when you get sleepless nights back to back, no more than 3 hours each night and you got stuff to do.
Signal	Hey! So it's been a couple of days leading to me going to university, and my sleep has been affected massively, and i genuinely can't tell if i'm going through yet another insomniac period, or it's stress. A couple of days ago i've been fairly excited but also stressed with a number of things in my waking life, ontop of that i ended up hallucinating something standing over my bed like 4 or so days ago, coupled with some really bad nightmares. &#x200B;So at the moment i'm getting like 3-5 hours of sleep a night, maybe more but i wake up every hour and a half after that, with severe trouble switching off to go to sleep, no matter how much i even try to relax, i can't enter that heavy pre sleep state which lulls you off to dream/nightmareland. &#x200B;I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, which might also be a contributing factor in my sleeplessness . And my sleep schedule has been really out of whack too, so my cicardian rythm might also be another factor too. &#x200B;To cut it short, has anyone got any advice that might work or any opinions because i'm getting really irritable and i'm considering just banging my head on the wall till i pass out. Ps. Cheers for reading this mini essay
Signal	Remember when I was younger, I would always take hours to sleep, but I never complained about it to anyone because I always had this weird mentality that I just need to suck it up and not complain. My grandma keeps telling me it’s my computer and my phone keeping me up, but I really don’t think so I believe it’s a medical problem. I just lay in bed with my eyes closed literally till seven 8:30 in the morning, but are usually fall asleep by then. It’s always taken me hours to fall asleep and when it’s bad over five hours. Does anyone know where the sleep study is and what they will do? I feel like if I do it they’re just going to give me medicine that will help me fall asleep, which I think will help how do you find the root cause and fix it?
NotSignal	Im so happy.. It just a small gadget I bought from online and It worked really well unexpectedly..so amazing..
NotSignal	Hi everyone new to to this sub anyways I used not sleep in high school/college very well and I'm currently quitting smoking I've smoked for 7 years and I've not slept in 4/5 days if that's due to smoking how can I quit and stil function normally.
Signal	So I've always slept easy but going through some shit atm and can't sleep it's nearly 6am again I'm knackered and will be all day tomorrow again. The drs have prescribed me some sleeping tablets but that's only 7 days not sure if I should take them for a week straight or make them last so at least I get a good nights sleep every other night? I only sleep if I drink which makes me sad and I don't need any more help with that atm otc herbal ones don't work and antihistamines make me feel tired and shitty the next day. I've always slept well since a child but I'm feeling so shitty and then not sleeping to fuck this.
NotSignal	If you close your eyes and slow your breathing even if you are awake all night you will be more rested than a night of tossing and turning even if you don’t get a wink of sleep and is even somewhat of a substitute for sleep- especially if you can try and focus on breathing. Someone told me this when I was younger and it massively helped me and is true- you do feel much more rested it also really helped my anxiety about sleeping. Just putting it out there in case it helps anyone.
NotSignal	Is this insomnia? I don't have anything to be anxious over when trying to sleep and it's not like I'm not tired. The only reason I sleep every other day to every other 2 days is because my body just can't function anymore. I also have tourettes and sleepless nights make that about 100 times worse. So any tips?
Signal	Hi fellow insomniacsI’ve had chronic insomnia since my early teen years and tried so many things over the years without any success. Some of these things have been:-Melatonin (small and large doses)-Turning off devices and storing them in another room hours before bedtime-Regular exercise and healthier diet-Ambien/Lunesta-Mimosa pudica/ Magnesium supplements-CBD (many different brands, types and dosages)-Deep breathing/meditation-Getting a new mattress/pillow-Biofeedback-CBT techniques I have ADHD (no longer takes medication for this) and recently learned there might be a connection between the two. My SO tells me that I don’t snore or make gasping sounds at night, so I don’t think it’s anything like sleep apnea. I am so desperate for sleep and scour the internet for hours looking for a cure. I thought maybe someone here might have a new suggestion that might help.
NotSignal	is there anything anyone can recommend to help me get a normal night of sleep consistently for once in my life? as a kid i would just smother myself with a pillow until i blacked out or cry myself into exhaustion. as a teenager i struggled with drug addiction and now as an adult i rely on weed. so i have tried my fair share of methods and right now i just need other options. literally any option that has ever worked for you i am willing to try please help me!!!
Signal	I've had sleep problems for a really long time, but they've recently gotten really bad. I only get like two hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky, and I can't seem to bring myself to sleep unless I literally can't stay awake any longer. I will fight with myself to stay awake as long as possible. I've had health issues for a very long time, including a heart condition (wpw) and breathing problems. The heart condition got fixed with surgery (though sometimes I still have palpitations and other bad symptoms), but the breathing is really bad. I've had to go to the emergency room several times for it at three in the morning, but they don't know what's going on, so I'm basically screwed. They just tell me to suck it up and hope I don't die. So I stay up every night, scared I'm going to die in my sleep. My thought process is that if I stay awake, I can catch any sort of heart attack or breathing issue and will be able to deal with it more so than if I was asleep. If you know anything about wpw, there have been stories of people dying from it suddenly in their sleep after an ablation (the surgery I got), so it's always scared me and I never want to fall asleep. And adding that to the breathing problems and fear of suffocation, it leads to a not so great night. All this anxiety and fear led to pure sleep deprivation and I'm so tired, but I don't want to sleep. I couldn't even stand well today because of how tired and weak I felt. Is there any way to stop this before it gets any worse..?
NotSignal	During the quarantine, I started to sleep at 2 A.M then it got worse to 4 A.M unknowingly. Before, I let my brain run then I would go to sleep. But now I toss and turn for an hour just to sleep and I feel sleepy for most of the day. But when I do sleep, I sleep until around 2 P.MDo I have insomnia? And if I do, what help can I get?
Signal	Hi everyone, hope you’re ok. To start, I’m MtF Transgender (male to female) and I suffer from quite a few mental disorders. I recently started suffering from anorexia and found that not eating or eating practically nothing drains my energy and forces my body to sleep. It’s not much and it’s usually light outside by the time I finally fall asleep, but at least I’m not going 3 or 4 days without sleep. Just thought I’d open this for discussion. Have a great day.
NotSignal	I met someome here suggestings chinese herbs and then when i requested a sample he tried to blackmail me.
NotSignal	Sometimes when lying on my back I will start drifting off to sleep but I will start to hear myself snoring and wake myself up again. This only happens during the sleep transition. I don't gasp for breath or have a racing heart or anything. Once I'm fully asleep I'm fine.
NotSignal	I’m a newbie here joining because I need a place to go where people actually understand how debilitating and soul destroying insomnia and sleep deprivation is. I’m so fed up of people irl giving me useless dumb advice or acting like this literal torture is no big deal when they have no idea how hard it is. Why is there so much ignorance around something that clearly affects so many people’s lives!?
NotSignal	So I've noticed no matter how tired I am if I don't take medication the second I lie down I have enough energy to run a fucking marathon has anyone else experienced this?
Signal	I have battled insomnia for about 15 years. And tried everything you can think of besides pharmaceuticals. Yoga. Meditation. Reduced screen time. Over the counter sleep aids. Melatonin. Ect ect But this last week while laying in bed wide awake I noticed how unbearably loud my apartment it. I can hear the fan, the fridge, cars going by and my neighbors... and it made me decide to try out ear plugs again(I’ve used them in the past but had a bad experience with the ones I got back then, and really really gave it another thought) Anyhow, someone recommended getting the extra soft ones, AND THEY ACTUALLY WORK!!. I went from getting 2-4 hours of sleep a night to 5-7. I know that it’s still not perfect but it’s honestly such a noticeable difference in my energy, and mood, and I’m just happy and feel alive again.. I would recommend trying them if you haven’t! And even if you have tried them in the past spend the 2 dollars and give it another try!!! I really hope this helps others as much as it helped me!!!!.
NotSignal	Last week I've been sleeping in such weird and funny way, It goes like that this:once I lay down, I start avoiding words in my mind, avoiding articulation of any kind, of thought, image or ideas, It almost always help me fall asleep, but once I fall, I start dreaming and i fully vividly dream, my dreams have mildly complex plots but I can remember most of it at the next day, but once the plot of the dream is over, once the "story" gets to its "conclusion", I wake up, and I cant avoid it... So then I do everything possible to fall asleep again, and once I get It, a brand new dream with its interesting plot take over my mind and so on the story repeats until next day... Each dream lasts for about 45 minutes and it takes me about an hour to fall asleep, so last night for example, I had like 4 dreams and 4 awakens which more or less means like 3 hours of real sleep... I feel more or less rested at the next day, but I can't stop having fun seeing how mi mind is working like a cinema hahaha...Has something like that happened to any of you? What do you think that is for?
Signal	I have had insomnia on and off for as long as I can remember. I have always been afraid of taking prescription meds because I’ve always heard negative things about the potential side effects. My insomnia has been really bad lately and I’ve tried so many “natural” things (melatonin, valerian), I even tried diphenhydramine even though it isn’t natural. Nothing helped until I started taking 5HTP again, I used to take it for anxiety and it was helpful. The only way it helps is if I take more than the recommended dose. Does anyone take natural supplements that they find really helpful? Thank you 🙏🏽
NotSignal	A hurricane destroyed my house so I’ve had to move twice within three weeks and the beds I’m using really flare up my inflammation... I can’t sleep for more than 1 or 2 hours.Also it’s really uncomfy to stay in a place where there’s no room for you and you can’t even eat breakfast or lunch because the house owner works nights and sleeps on the couch.
NotSignal	I had a whole couple of weeks of getting sufficient sleep. The past two or three nights have been horrible. I can't even sleep late. The city is excavating my street. It's not just the noise, it's when they hit the ground and it feels like the tractor is ramming into the house.
Signal	Recently had a VP shunt put into my brain from hydrocephalus. Since being home from the hospital I've been experiencing insomnia and can't sleep NO MATTER what I try. Anxiety keeps me up. Can this become permanent? What are some things I can try to fix this. I'm scared :(
Signal	It’s been almost 3 weeks of 1-2 hours of sleep, I am just ready to literally jump off a building to end it all. I’ve taken melatonin, beta blockers, and other stuff. Tried sleeping apps, tried resetting my body clock, tried exercise to exhaustion before bed... nope.I’m just not meant to live in this world, if this goes on, I’ll probably just end it all
NotSignal	I get insomnia anyway, it's a normal part of my life. But this HEAT. Its oppressive. It's humid and stupid and I can't fall asleep because any skin in contact with anything just feels like it's on fire.So what does my smart *ss do? Go online and spend a frankly ridiculous amount of money on bedding and tea canisters. Great job, insomnia. 🙄
Signal	I've struggled with insomnia as long as I can remember (16 y/o male). I have problems getting to sleep initially as well as staying asleep. Most of my life it was manageable, but it's slowly gotten worse throughout my life and I started getting sick much more often my freshman year, and made in sophomore year made it to the point where I was often missing school solely because of lack of sleep. I've tried many prescribed medications, including trazodone and hydroxyzine, as well as melatonin doses ranging from 1-12 mg. None of these had any effect on how long it took me to fall asleep, nor any effect on how long I stayed asleep. I finally had a sleep study done, but due to covid-19 they couldn't test me with a decent mask, as it would disperse any respiratory viruses throughout the area. Because of this they used a plastic piece with two cylindrical holes to detect whether I was breathing or not that was situated over my nose. I found that the piece obstructed my breathing ever so slightly, but I didn't think much of it. However, throughout the night, I found myself beginning to drift off only to find myself sharply inhaling and realizing I hadn't been breathing. Previous to this night, in all my years of life I had never experienced this, and I knew it was a sign of sleep apnea, but I felt like the problem was caused by the piece of plastic obstructing my breathing. The results came back and I was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Is it possible that the plastic nose piece did lead to a misdiagnosis? Has anybody else had problems with this stupid plastic thing?
Signal	I have always suffered from insomnia to some degree but during lockdown it got so bad I didn’t sleep for 3 days. Was prescribed Promethazine which has worked like a charm & have been using it for nearly 2 weeks now. However I’m not a huge fan of the idea of needing to take medication every single night to sleep so tried to have a night without it last night - turned out to be hopeless and I took Promethazine again around 4am. Have any of you had success coming off it and being able to fall asleep naturally? Could use some tips. Thanks!
NotSignal	I’ve been getting acupuncture treatments for insomnia for the past couple of weeks & had a decent night’s sleep last night for the first time in ages. Even woke up once to pee around 4am - which often means I’m up for the rest of the night - and went back to sleep! Omg I feel like a totally new woman. Life is good again. I had success with acupuncture before some years ago, but hadn’t found anyone/anywhere to go since I moved a while back. I highly recommend giving it a try if you’re like me and not happy having to take drugs in order to sleep. It does take several sessions to kick in usually. Good luck everyone!
NotSignal	So I cut sugars from my diet (currently fasting as a catholic) and weirdly enough it seems to improve my ability to fall asleep, makes me wake up less during the night and it makes getting out of bed easier in the morning. Maybe someone might find that helpful Cheers and sleep tight(er?)
Signal	Two days ago, I took half of a Zopiclone pill in hope that would help me fall asleep, but it didn’t work. I don’t think i’ve developped a tolerance yet cause i’ve only taken a full pill three times and it was two weeks ago. Or maybe it is because I took half of it instead of the full pill? Thanks
Signal	My daughter is 6. She’s been having problems since she was 2. It’s like her brain can’t turn off & she can’t calm down. We’ve done lotions, baths, no electronics, soft music....everything you’d expect. Her pediatrician out her on melatonin when she was 2. She’s now almost 6 and has taken it the last 4 years. I’m not sure if it’s the best option, I feel like it’s not working as well as it did. She doesn’t see that same pediatrician anymore, our insurance changed. Our current one didn’t seem concerned either way but as if now it takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to get her to sleep. It’s exhausting for us & I’m so tried.
NotSignal	When everything's blue. It's a little quiet and soft, a little warmth from the sun and some chill in the air.There's certain sense of calm when you've been up all night and exhausted, you go out to breathe, and the world starts to wake..Or when you finally have a good body clock and actually wake up early?
NotSignal	I have a hard enough time falling and staying asleep, and I used to not dream (or at least I would wake up and not remember them). However, for the past month I've been plagued with bizarre and horrible dreams. I'm at the point I don't want to sleep because I'm exhausted of the hyper-realist dreams of friends committing suicide, being involved in plane crashes, being trapped in firestorms, murdering people, hiding from murderous authorities, and the beat goes on and on every single night... I'm truly drained by these dreams that seem more real than the world I wake up to. My dream journal, if I kept one, would quickly become a Stephen King-like novella. Last night was a dream fit for a daytime drama. Ultimately, I watched my best friend throw himself down a flight of stairs because his girlfriend used him and stole his dead mother's earrings. The night before that, I dreamt I shot a girl that broke into my house because she needed food for her baby and she died in my arms. I'm so sick and so damn tired of these horrid dreams. It's almost 4:30AM now and I'm fighting tooth and nail to keep from sleeping because I don't want to know what's in store tonight. Every night it's different and every night it's hell. I don't know what I'm looking for here... sympathy, help, reconciliation that I'm not alone, or to vent I guess. I'm trying to maintain optimism, thinking that this is only temporary and it'll pass, but it's been a month of torture after spending a significant chunk of life having very little dreams to remember. Oh and a couple dreams I do remember: 1) (ambien fueled) Sex with a talking velociraptor. 2) Flying with my cat like Superman and Krypto. What I wouldn't give to go back to that class of dream or none at all again.
NotSignal	I want to see if it helps but I’ve had paranoia on it before just wondering if it helped anyone else or if it just makes it worse..............................................................................
Signal	So back in late January of 2019 I had a major anxiety attack. My immune system was doing poorly due to a really bad stomach bug and I guess it made my already bad mental health worse. For two weeks, I battled with calming my anxiety attacks with medication and getting to sleep at a normal time again. Eventually, things returned to some normality. But ever since then, it takes me longer to get to sleep. And as the year progressed, I had nights where I just couldn't get to sleep for no reason. And I had to go to sleep at later times to feel tired enough. And then the anxiety medication I was taking because of the major anxiety attack was causing me to have muscle spasms at night, right before I went to bed. My doctor told me to get off of them and that fixed the problem. Unfortunately for over a year now, my sleep cycle has been a mess and I dread going to sleep because it means I'll be lying awake for hours for no reason and sleep just won't come no matter how tired I get. The last two nights have been awful. I go to sleep at 1am and don't get actual sleep until 9am. And I tried having a bath, meditating, imagining peaceful scenerios, excercising more to wear myself out, tried practicing good sleep hygenie. Nothing seems to work. And now I'm scared that this will be the new norm and I'll never get back to my 11pm to 7am sleep schedule I had for over a decade. I need some advice or tried and true ways to deal with insomnia like this. I always do get to sleep, but it takes forever so I guess its not full blown insomnia but it still sucks. Any advice would be wonderful.
Signal	I've suffered from severe insomnia for about 8 months. I'll go a day or couple days without achieving any sleep and then when my body's about to shut down, I get some sleep for one night and then the sleeplessness continues.My eyes have become really red and bloodshot from the insomnia and I've become very self-conscious about it when interacting with other people. Any suggestions for eye drops or tips and tricks to reduce the redness? I've read that redness reducing eye drops like Visine are more harmful in the long run so don't really want to use those. . .
NotSignal	Just over 30 minutes ago, I was sound asleep. That was until I was (violently?) startled awake from deep sleep. The same thing happened about a week ago. I would be sound asleep, until I just suddenly throw my arms out and cover my head.I’ve considered the possibility of something falling somewhere inside the house, or maybe a loud crash of thunder startling me in my sleep. But I got confirmation that neither one of those occurred. My mother is a light sleeper, and she’ll be up at 2, sometimes 3 in the morning, before later going back to sleep. She told me that she hadn’t heard anything of the sorts.Another factor I considered was the possibility of something loud playing from my headphones. I sometimes listen to ASMR videos to sleep to. I always try to play videos that are about 30 minutes to an hour long if possible. However, I set my phone to lock 15 minutes after no activity. So I don’t think that has any affect.I’ve looked up information on Sleep Apnea and Parasomnia, but neither of those things come close to what I believe I’m experiencing.Does anyone here have any ideas? Or any information I can try and look into?
NotSignal	What do you guys do when you're trying to sleep... But oh no... Thoughts wander in your brain and be like "sup bro" . And starts fucking ur sleep for like 3 hours straight. And after that u don't even want to sleep, because the thought of sleep is feared cuz the thoughts might come back... Some one reading this must be like "omg that's me" , I can't be the only one going through this.I've had this pro lem for quite while.So I'm asking yall, what do you do?Sincerely a M (24)
Signal	So it feels like my insomnia, after first being a lot of things, is now mainly one thing. I'm tired. I lay down to sleep. I get into position. And then, just as I'm about to fall off, I get the falling sensation. I know, hypnic jerk. It's common. And usually not a problem. But this isn't a FULL hypnic jerk. It's JUST around my heart. The body is numb. The limbs are heavy. But it's like someone JUST dropped my heart. Which then responds by beating fast. And when that happens, any sound I hear jerks up me like a gun shot.So I do deep breathing exercises. And body relaxation. And reading a boring book. And then I'm tired and I lay down and just as I'm about to drift off...heart hypnic jerk. Again. And that's the cycle all night long. Over and over and over again.Anyone else have this specific kind of insomnia? Any strategies?
NotSignal	So I've been struggling a few weeks with sleeping. I either can't fall asleep, or stay asleep. Usually my day starts at 4am because it doesn't matter what I do I can't go back to sleep. I'm thinking of trying sleeping tablets. Can anyone reccomend any and/or tell me the pros and cons? Much appreciated
Signal	I haven’t been falling asleep till 4,5 or sometimes 6 in the morning and I can’t stand it. Before this all started I’d fall asleep about 11-12, but the past couple weeks I find myself with my eyes closed for how many hours and not falling asleep, has anyone else been having this problem since the quarantine started? It’s driving me nuts.
NotSignal	So I’ve been going through a mild episode I’m sleeping but not until about 5 in the morning band only till about 8 so not much. Whenever I get episodes my brain runs out of things to think about and I get really depressed and since I have no one to talk to since its the middle of the night the depressed thought usually last for a while. So I was hoping you guys could help me just chat I don’t need therapy or advice just people to talk to because my cats aren’t very good at conversing. So how have you been doing?
Signal	After coming back from an overnight vacation, I found that I can no longer sleep alone and I don’t know why. When someone is sleeping next to me, I can sleep easily. However, if they are just sitting in bed and are awake, I can’t sleep. I also can’t sleep alone. I wake up every like 15 minutes or so or jolt/twitch myself awake. I don’t know why. I go into bed with the same mindset, thinking the same thoughts but I always cannot sleep when I’m alone. There was one time I tried really hard to sleep and I kept thinking positive thoughts and I actually was able to sleep. But it took so much effort and it took longer than when I am sleeping with someone. I wasn’t able to do this again. I’m not depressed or sad or anything. I don’t know why this is happening.
NotSignal	Do any of you guys have this or knows whether it has a name? It's so stupid and it makes me furious thinking about it! If I could've been relaxed and sleepy the entire night, why does it only happen as soon as I actually need to hop outta bed?! It has happened so many times now, it's confusing me as I haven't been able to find anything online about this specific thing. It doesn't bother me as much as, you know, not being able to sleep, but it still intrigues me.
Signal	I had trouble last year not dropping off to sleep until 2am, but now since I got blue-light blocking glasses, I can fall asleep OK.But now, I am waking up 3am, and sometimes can't get back to sleep until 5am, or my sleep is very patchy.Any advice?(Extra info: Melotonin doesn't really work for me, sometimes it does if I take a super-high dose, Lavander oil seems to work a little. Anti-histamines work sometimes but often not. I am on Keto diet so my blood sugar is not high.)
NotSignal	Like I can fall asleep at first for like smt beetwen 1-2 hours at best , then I wake up At the middle of the night and I just can never go back to sleep no matter how hard I try so I just lay in bed living with flashbacks questioning Every Fucking Decision till the sun rise.
NotSignal	I don’t know what to do. I’ve been getting insomnia for a week straight. It keeps me the whole night. How do I resolve this? I tried headspace but it doesn’t work. I am lost and don’t know what to do.
NotSignal	Non-native English speaker here. I have OCD and sometimes a particular thought gets stuck in the head and prevents from falling asleep. The closest analogy I can come up with is that this is like a song stuck in your head that plays like a broken record and causing you distress and/or annoyance. Can anyone suggest solutions to get rid of that thought and fall asleep?
NotSignal	Every night it feels like the entire time is spent with nightmares. I can only manage to sleep in 1-2 hour intervals. It's hard to keep track but I generally have 2-4 nightmares that I can remember each night with only 4-6 hours of constantly interrupted sleep. Some of them are so realistic that I get confused if they actually happened or not (side effect of C-PTSD). Others could be made into some dope horror films (Script writers hit me up lol). Does anyone else have this problem? Speculations on cause? Maybe anxiety/panic disorder/exc?
Signal	So for the past week, I learned about this thing called sfi that has actually scared me so bad that I can’t sleep anymore. My meds were the only thing putting me to sleep. But tonight they didn’t work. I’ve been taking some cbd oil for anxiety which somewhat works but I’m always fearing I have sfi. I am just asking for some reassurance that I don’t have this. Maybe I should up the dose? It’s 25 mg seroquel. I was on the brink of sleep but here I am thinking I have sfi. Is it possible the anxiety and fear overpowered the meds sleep effects. Plz help me. I’m honestly utterly terrified now. Could this just be a REALLY bad case of ordinary insomnia? Or should I be worried. Plz help. I’m really struggling with this fear in the back of my head.
Signal	I've noticed for years now when a viscous cycle of insomnia hits that my thoughts go into a deep dark pit of despair before I recover. It's been happening for years so please don't be worried I kinda recognize it for what it is... but does anyone else go into that pit of depression after long bouts of insommnia?
Signal	I've posted this on another subreddit, but I thought I'd do it here too. So, this is a call for help. All my life I've been suffering from insomnia. No pills or treatments have ever worked for me. I feel like I'm starting to get depressed at this point, because I feel tired every minute of the day and I can't live a normal life because of that: I'm never able to concentrate, I feel myself zoning out during conversations, my grades are awful (I literally can't study because of how tired I am)... I've been to a lot of doctors and none of them could find a solution, it's like I'm inmune to all the sleep pills or something. If someone suffers from this just like me, could you help me or give any advice? How do I get at least a few more hours of sleep (I usually sleep between 2-4 hours a day, and some nights I can't even fall asleep)? Are there any meditation techniques, food, etc that help? Everything is useful. Thank you.
NotSignal	Another day another night, but I still can't get no sleep alright. Been trying to work on my song to pass the time ([https://soundcloud.com/areasontolive/artl-open-your-eyes/s-8z1qc](https://soundcloud.com/areasontolive/artl-open-your-eyes/s-8z1qc)) How is everyone else doing?
NotSignal	I've had a condition for several months now at the cusp of falling asleep my body goes into fight or flight mode. Does this occur for anyone else?
NotSignal	Today i woke earlier on purpose. So at around midnight i am sleepy. So i decide to sleep. I go to sleep. I fall asleep and i wake up 2 hours after, fresh as never before and can't go back to sleep.Happens to me every time i go to sleep earlier then my usual 3-4am bedtime.What do i do about this?
NotSignal	I hate to make my initial subs like this, about whatever is freaking me out before doing any kind of proper introduction. But i'm really starting to dread going to sleep, Lately I've been getting a lot of hypnic jerks when I go to bed. I know they're normal, and i'm no stranger to them. But it really feels like i'm having them a lot. Almost nightly. And they're not the small little twitches either. It's the kind that wake you up completely. It's either a big muscle spasm., or me just waking up taking a deep breath like I've had a nightmare or something. Last night I've been having a lot of the latter and another kind of odd sensation that I can't really explain. The only thing I can compare it too are brain zaps. But I haven't been off of any medication. And I don't know what to do. I've limited my activity before going to bed, I don't drink alcohol or caffeine before bed. I might watch some TV and have something light to eat before going to bed, but that's it. I do have troubles with Hypochondria or health anxiety. But I haven't been stressing out enough to warrant Hypnic Jerks or physical symptoms. I became concerned about seeing some eye floaters that I've had for years. But again, I wasn't panicking over that to the point where I start feeling sick or exhausted. And it's getting to the point where i'm dreading going to sleep, i'm going to bed later and later every night because of this. And that definitely doesn't help with them. I hope numerous jerks like this aren't correlated with some serious illness.
Signal	I'm assuming most of you have bad problems with insomnia, which is why we're all here in this sub together. How are you dealing with work? Even though most of us are WFH right now, I feel like I can't function. I can't concentrate on work and I'm forgetting stuff! What do you all do to combat this? Just grit thru it? Has anyone had to take time off work for a few days/weeks? I feel like I'm at this point rn and super stressed. Advice please!
Signal	I had worst nights sleep for ages last night. I couldnt sleep by 2.25AM and I need to urinate a few times when I can't sleep but my carer insists on putting in on very very bright sensor lights on in the night. They can be turned off I know because I turn them off sometimes but she lies to me that they cant get turned off. As soon as I open bedrom door one bright light blasts me in face making me feel awake then when I go downstairs another one which is about 2 foot from eyes at bottom of stairs blasts me. Then there is another sensor light in the living room which blasts me in the face. Every time these lights are on it messes my sleep up proper and messes up the whole next day. To make it worse the one at the top of the stairs takes tskes about 10 minutes to turn off and as the door doesn't got properl light shines through into the bedroom further 9reventing me sleeping. I managed to sleep about 3AM woke up 5:25AM got blasted by the light and have been awake over psst 1 and half hours with no chance of getting back to sleep It's not particularly not sleeping which messes me up the worst it's the lights when I'm tired. This affects me worse as I have sensory issues due to Aspergers thinking about getting one of those sleep masks to wear up and down stairs in the night. I have lots of things to do today but am not going to ne able to function do that is going to stress me put and. Anyone else experience anything like this and how do you cope please? Sorry this is do long.
Signal	I've been awake for a few days and should be exhausted. Well, should be exhausted right now instead of during the day when I actually have things to take care of. However, I'm laying here in bed wired terrified to fall asleep because I'm afraid there's no going back. I've been awake for so long that if I fall asleep I'll never wake up again. I know it's not logical, but it's getting to me nonetheless. I just can't shut my brain off.
NotSignal	As the title sugests i cant fall asleep in my room but as soon as I get in another room i dont have that problem anymore what could it be?
NotSignal	Their sleep schedule shifts wildly throughout a month. For a few days it might be falling asleep at 5/6am, waking up at 12pm, which is when they seem happiest about their sleep schedule. Then, invariably they stay up later and later each night, getting in bed around 10 or 11am, eventually falling sleep around noon, and either sleeping till 6-8pm, or waking an hour or two earlier if they have to work. Eventually, after a couple weeks of this cycle worsening, they try to pull an all-nighter to reset it. A lot of the time they end up falling asleep at 1pm and waking up around 9pm. Eventually it always gets to a point that resembles normal, but it only ever stays that way for a few nights.Does this sound like insomnia?
NotSignal	All the insomniacs must’ve went to sleep... cheers my friends. I’m going to go lay in bed and shame myself to sleep so I don’t feel like an absolute terrible husband and before the sun comes up
Signal	One lady who lives across the street is talking on the phone so loud I can hear her conversation. Three dogs have been barking at each other nonstop for an hour. I finally get to sleep and now this? I’d close my window but it’s already 75 degrees. It’s like I can’t fall asleep until it’s light outside and then the rest of the world keeps me up. Pardon my rant I’m just sooooooooooooo tired.
Signal	The last few years I’ve gotten maybe 3 hours of sleep on average after being awake 24 hours. Usually I’ll get some break in there but the last few weeks I’ve gotten no relief and it’s wearing on me hardcore. The only time I slept normal (8 hours) was during pregnancy last year for a month (I ended up miscarrying around 9 weeks). Anyone else currently in or have been in a similar boat? I’m literally losing my mind and nothing is working which just fuels my anxiety more. I have a few appointments next week but need relief in the meantime.
NotSignal	Who wants to chat? Is there a magical Reddit button to push to start a chat or dm or whatever?
NotSignal	Hi everyone As someone who dealt with insomnia for almost two years, I know how stressful it is. I’m hoping to share my story with the hopes that it might help someone else. After a few stressful weeks at work and not being able to sleep, I developed insomnia. Just to be clear my insomnia wasn’t caused by a medical condition (I.e. there was nothing physically causing this). A few things I have tried and seemed to have made a difference: 1. Waking up at the same time everyday and going out for a walk. Rain or shine, this is something I HAVE to do. Almost like I’m going to work, even though I’m working from home these days.2. Meditation. But please be aware that there is actually a wrong way to meditate (i.e. make sure to not expect anything). I don’t think meditating for 10 mins a day helped me sleep directly, but I do think it has helped me be aware when my mind is jumping all over the place, which I think is the reason why I couldn’t seem to sleep. When I am aware that my mind is racing (both at night time or during the day) I can do something to ground myself. 3. You have probably heard about the above 2 points before so this next point is what really sealed the deal for me: I started to view my inability to sleep as a good thing, almost like I now have time to myself to do something I enjoy. Almost like when I was a teenager and I had to get up for school in the morning, but I would be up until 2-3 am because my favourite K drama was still on TV. So if I’m not tired, I now play the piano because I’ve been wanting to learn for a long time. Or I read that book that I’ve been holding off for a while. I even tried to do my taxes lol. I probably wouldn’t watch a psycho thriller at 2 am, but the point was to not put so much emphasis on sleep. Sleep is just something our bodies do automatically (like breathing) and I can’t force it. I did this for about a week, while making sure to get up at the same time everyday since I need to work. And sure enough, I started sleeping. And what’s more, sleep doesn’t have such a big impact on me anymore. Sure, I will have a bad night. I might only get 3-4 hours sleep. But everyone has bad nights now and again. Oh, one more practical thing I did was, I moved my bed into the living room because I realised that I started getting anxiety whenever I enter the bedroom. So I moved out my bed, and whenever I get tired at night doing all the things I mentioned above, I would go lie down with the intention to just ‘rest’ a bit, not sleep. Once my anxiety around bed time got better, I moved it back into the bedroom. I also thought ‘The Sleep Book’ was a good resource if you are having sleep anxiety, and just anxiety in general. Hope this helps! You can defeat this!!
Signal	I’ve been up for days and I’m off benzos and ambien and I still can’t sleep. Is there anything at all that prescribed that stronger than ambien I’ve never heard of such a thing but I’m so desperate to go to sleep. Really hope this gets responses!
Signal	So for the past year I have had insomnia and problems getting 8 hours sleep every night. It seems to hit me in bouts, so for a few weeks I can sleep perfectly fine but at other times I can go a whole week with 3 to 4 hours sleep a night.The problem I have and I'm looking for some advice on this but my family don't understand me and basically kind of laugh at me.When I've had no hours sleep in particularly, I dont want to then be bugged all day, I try to explain that I'm really tired and they treat me like ive had sleep and its frustrating.I will say back to them if only you knew the pain I am in, when you have red eyes so much to the point it becomes normal. Everybody else is okay when it comes to sleep, never heard of one of them say I couldn't sleep its like as soon as they hit the pillow they get the sleep they need which is even more frustrating for me as they will just never get where I'm coming from.Any advice and thoughts would be much appreciated :)
Signal	I write this at a quarter after five after another night of restlessness.I used to be able to sleep extremely well a few months ago, and all my life. I'd go to bed at a decent time, and be able to stay asleep all night long.However the past few months I've rapidly changed. It first started out as me falling asleep later and later, then eventually sleeping every other day, then until now, my sleep has gone to shit.I'm an avid marathoner, so just last week after running 13 miles one day I came home completely exhausted, I ate a big meal and fell asleep around 8 o'clock thinking I was in for a full night of sleep. But no, I woke up shortly after 1am fully awake with no chance of going back to bed.Even tonight, I fell asleep at around 1:30 and woke up shortly before five and woke up multiple times during my sleep.Every night is the same, either I dont sleep, or sleep so little and watch the sunrise every morning.But even then sometimes I'll just "die" during the middle of the day, I'll have no recollection of me falling asleep and I'll usually be asleep for six or seven hours, but only after many nights of no sleep.What is happening to me?
Signal	No hope for sleep tonight. It's officially close to morning now. I've had sleeping issues since kindergarten but I hadn't had sleepless nights for the last couple of years. I wish I'd appreciated it more over those years. I hope things get better but I'm afraid it's going to keep getting worse. I now have anxiety about falling asleep hours before bed time. Thanks for listening.
Signal	Im writing this here because I feel like no doctors or my partner/family take me seriously. Please note, I have tried:Increasing exercise, adjusting diet, I don’t drink caffeine, I’ve tried sleeping meds (zolpidem and melatonin, made me feel like crap), meditation, even non conventional treatments like hypnosis and acupuncture. Different mattresses, rooms, routines.I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child I struggled to sleep through the night. My parents would despair trying to send me to bed, and I was the classic ‘read under the duvet with torch’ child and I’d often fall asleep at school. This has carried on through to my adulthood only I have had to force myself to adapt to the requirements of 9-5 working life. I don’t believe I have insomnia (although I have had periods of getting very little sleep), because I *can* sleep, just not before a certain time. My brain/body seems to want to be awake at night, for some reason I am more alive/productive/creative/motivated at night time. An ideal sleep schedule for me would be 4-5am until say, 12pm. If I try and sleep before this, I constantly wake up/jerk awake feeling restless and unable to get back to sleep. Of course this isn’t practical, and I am starting to get depressed about it, I feel my only option is to try and find a job that accommodates this type of lifestyle but as a designer/developer this isn’t entirely possible. I am having to get by on such little sleep and trying to get up for work is getting harder. I’m not really looking for solutions here, I just want to know why I’m like this and why I can’t sleep like normal people?EDIT to add: It is also tiring (heh) to have people assume you are lazy or a slob because you sleep late.
Signal	I’ve struggled with sleep issues since I was a child, and it has never really been addressed. Mild sleep apnea, anxiety, and a bunch of other things make me take hours to fall asleep, and constantly have me waking up for long stretches of time. They don’t want me on a cpap machine since I’m too young, and melatonin recently has completely stopped working for me so the past week has been brutal. I’m really debating asking my psychiatrist about sleeping meds, but I’m nervous bc we’re already in the midst of a med change for other things:( and I don’t want to burden anyone during this crisis. (sorry for the rant)
Signal	Backstory: Hello, I’m a 17 year old male and I have been prescribed the drug for about 6 months. I mainly started taking it every night once I suffered from a bad concussion, because it was one of the only ways I could sleep. Before the concussion, I would take it whenever I noticed I wasn’t feeling too tired, maybe once every 2 or 3 nights if that. It should also be noted that I have a history of sleep problems, although I don’t believe I’ve ever been diagnosed. I was prescribed trazodone for years and I only took it for a short time, because it started making me feel nauseous at the dose I needed for it to work.Fast forward to now, and I literally cannot sleep without this drug. I can still get a prescription, but I don’t like being dependent for my sleep. It may have something to do with having almost no physical activity due to coronavirus as well as having mono for the last month. I took almost half a bottle of zzzquil, last night and just ended up playing video games the whole time. I’ve searched all over and I can’t find any help about a sleep dependency on this drug. I usually take melatonin as well, but it doesn’t work half as well as amitriptyline for me. I got 12 hours of sleep yesterday, but only because I stayed up for 30 hours straight and was downing zzzquil. Can anyone give me advice on this? Is it a bad idea to quit cold turkey? (hint: I did)TLDR: I developed a sleep dependency on Amitriptyline over the course of a few months and I’m struggling to get my body back to normal. Any help?
NotSignal	I think my insomnia is OCD related. My brain gets stuck in loops and will repeat the same thoughts for hours, sometimes all night. It can be part of a song, a sentence, a random noise and I just loop it for hours in my head. I have mild OCD (really it only manifests when I lock doors or turn off the stove and have to do it dozens of times before I’m ready to stop). I used to be on medication for it but it made me lose too much weight. Curious if others have OCD related insomnia or advice for snapping out of loops.
Signal	I usually can't sleep at night at all because of my anxiety so during the day i end up falling asleep every few hours but don't know that i was asleep if that makes sense it usually only lasts 20 to 30 minutes at a time but it's very inconvenient when i need to be productive sorry if this is the wrong sub for this I've tried coffee but it just makes me anxious
Signal	I hear so many people on this sub talking about how they haven’t slept in days. Have you guys gone to the doctor and got medication? I am a insomniac and I went to the doctor and he just gave me SSRIs; they didn’t work. If you have been prescribed something can you please tell me about it and if it worked?
Signal	Im sure this has been asked before but...Ever since my grandma died about a month ago, my mom has been having trouble/anxiety about sleeping. She's contacted her doctor and gotten some medicine, but it still doesn't seem to help. Any tips that could help her? Or is there anything u guys suggest I can do to help her? I just don't want her to get sick from not sleeping enough. Thanks.
NotSignal	I'm trying to fall asleep but am constantly awoken by my legs or muscles twitching followed by my mind becoming more aware. Does anyone else get these and if so, how do you stop them?
NotSignal	All I do is check facebook, Linkedin, watch Netflix and sometimes code. Is there anything more exciting I could be doing? No one is up and it's not like there is a bunch of stuff to do especially in the middle of a pandemic.
Signal	i’m not too educated about insomnia but i know the basics, i’m also 15Mi have lots of nights where i try really hard to sleep, take melatonin and everything, and my body is up at 3:00am unable to go to sleep forcing me to head downstairs to watch my laptop so that my sanity stays in tact until everyone wakes up. on those kinds of nights if i do sleep at most i get 2 hours of it. i’m not too good at keeping track of it but i think this happens about 1 or 2 times a month and it’s awful when i’m so tired but i can’t drift off to bed, any help on analyzing what this might be a case of would help 😁😁
NotSignal	My sister has a lot of problems, but i love her and i have been living with her for 2 months. I see she has a serious sleep problem because she can't sleep or wakes up in the middle of the night. (or have sleep paralysis)Then she sleeps for a long time and she only wakes up in the afternoon. (1pm) This is not always the case, but many times. The trouble is, I can’t live that way. I get up "early" (8-9am) do my things and I can't be quiet for her. ( we live in a small place ) will I be a bad person if I force her to get up at 9 or 10am? I don't want to be insensitive, who does not take the her problems seriously .
Signal	I don’t suffer from insomnia all the time but does Anybody else feel this? As soon as I hear my gfs heavy breathing/snoring I instantly get full of anxiety. I suddenly feel very “alone” and my brain tells me “you really need to hurry up and get to sleep too”. This sudden anxiety also causes me to need a pee every five minutes which makes me even more on edge in case I wake my partner up.My gf tries staying up later with me but realistically this isn’t a healthy solution. I see her starting to nod off, heavy eyes, and I think “oh god please stay awake with me a bit longer”. It fills me with dread. I seem to settle better going to sleep on my own, but this means I spend most nights on the sofa downstairs. Partner feels like It’s her fault, or that I don’t want to sleep with her. I try falling asleep in bed, feel overwhelmed with anxiety to the point I can hear my heart thudding in my chest. It’s at this point I feel like crying in frustration and head to my sofa, defeated and sad. I think I just can’t sleep with other people in the room. The thought of sharing a hotel room with friends for example, fills me with dread.
Signal	so right now i am experiencing the longest night of my life, and i took the medication that is supposed to help me sleep and quell my latent rage.but when i try and force myself to stay awake i can't do it for much longer than any person with normal sleep patterns can. This leads to me being nocturnal for the majority of the year. I can't do anything about it and it really sucks. I'm going to take my medication to help me focus on staying awake so that i don't miss some meetings i have today.
NotSignal	I'm 16m. So during quarantine I've been going to sleep really late like at 3 or 4 am (using my phone until very late) and waking up at like 12 or 1 PM. 2 days ago I decided to sleep anit earlier around 1 am and woke up at 3 and wasn't able to get back to sleep at all. I shrugged it off as an off night and went through the morning feeling drowsy as hell. Yesterday I got 10 hours and today I slept at 3 and woke up at 5 and I'm worried its going to turn into a cycle unless I do something about it. Any suggestions? I've had sleep issues in the past when I was 14 where I'd always wake up at 3 am but it later went away. Those 2 weeks were hell and I'm trying to prevent them from happening again
Signal	Hey folks.Kind of an odd one here. I used to struggle immensely with sleeping, I got about 2-4 hours a day. Got put on psychiatric medications that make me extremely sleepy by night so am able to sleep. The issue is I hate sleeping because it is never restful, it's always incredibly painful. After last night, my worst night yet, I need to find someone that has any experience similar. I woke up 1-2 times every hour and every joint in my body, especially knees and shoulders ache. I have to readjust multiple times before finding any *tolerable* position of pain to go back to sleep. I've tried different beds, sleeping in different positions. The pain is fine throughout the day. It only begins *when sleeping*. I have an appointment on the 28th to see my psychiatrist, I'll be discussing this issue with him in hopes of a referral to get help. I'm just sooo clueless as to what is causing this.
NotSignal	Just watched an anxiety inducing video about not getting enough sleep at night and now I hate myself. Why do I do this to myself? Thanks TED ED. You’re the real one😞.
Signal	Hey all! I don’t know if this necessarily belongs in this group, but I have severe insomnia. I cannot fall asleep till 5/6am then wake up multiple times till I eventually fully wake up around 9/10. I’ve tried hydroxyzine, trazodone and I’m currently on Temazepam. Nothing has worked and I’m incredibly frustrated and exhausted. My doctor is worried about giving me ambien because it can be considered a “life long drug” but it might be the only thing that would work. Should I bring it up? What other strong sleep meds do you think that would work/good experiences?
NotSignal	Anyone want to start a group chat with me? I get really bored in the middle of the night.
Signal	I've had insomnia for a number of year now. It fluctuates from tolerable to absolutely no sleep. Im dealing with little to no sleep now. The worst part is that when I can get an hour or two of sleep it's full of nightmares. And these nightmares aren't the typical "I had a bad dream". These are extremely vivid and completely lucid. Ive always heard lucid dreaming is something to aim for and can be a wonderful experience. It is not. While I have a fair amount of control over my movements and interactions I have no control over what im actually dreaming about. Sometimes im myself and sometimes im living a completely different life. These different lives are reoccurring. Id rather have no sleep than a few hours of living these other dream lives. Can you imagine being in a terrible situation and knowing it's a dream. Knowing you can't be hurt doesn't protect you from images, the feeling of being bound, or horrible and terrible situations. Have you ever experienced desperately trying to wake yourself up so you dont have to experience dying again? It's a feeling I cannot articulate. I think only someone who has experienced it could truly understand. Am I alone?
Signal	Effectively everytime I start to fall asleep a body part will jerk and wake me up again. Usually my neck or shoulder, but it can be anywhere. On bad nights this happens like 100 times. Imagine that, drifting off to sleep and being pulled out of sleep 100 times. THat's a special type of tortureIt's gotten to the point where I am nervous and afraid to sleep. I'm probably averaging 2-3 hours a night over the last two weeks. I tried talking to a couple of "medical professionals" and they just told me it's anxiety and gave me sleeping meds. Which....don't help because it's not getting to sleep that's the problem it's staying asleep for longer than 30 seconds at a time.What a great life.
NotSignal	Can anybody recommend sleep medication for insomnia that actually helps you?
NotSignal	What are your methods to help you with insomnia? Also, what helps you cope with very stressful situations?
NotSignal	My doctor said the drug should be at pharmacies within 4 to 8 months
NotSignal	Between sports injuries and some long lasting illnesses I'm in poor conditions these days.For months now I've been experiencing very restless sleep. I'll wake up nearly hourly. It's wearing me out.When I tell doctors this they tend to overlook it and focus on my other more 'obvious' issues.Should I see a sleep specialist? Illnesses come and go yet my terrible sleep quality stays the same. I'm starting to feel like it's the other way around.My terrible sleep quality is making me ill, not my illnesses are ruining my sleep.
Signal	EDIT: So just called my doctor, and he mentioned he was hesitant on putting me on something like Ativan or any other benzo because of their tendency to cause dependencies, where Trazodone doesn't really have this effect. He's upped the dose to 100MG so hopefully, something comes out of it. I've dealt with on/off insomnia for a good chunk of my life (I'm 25 now), but as of late it's been way more common and I don't think I've had a single week of good sleep in about a month or so. I called my doctor and he prescribed Trazodone in 50MG doses, once per night about 30-45 minutes before bed. For about 3 days it worked very well but as of late I'm noticing the drowsiness is only temporary and I'm back to laying in bed, worrying about not being able to sleep and how much time I'm wasting, which in turn causes me to actually waste time and lose sleep. At this point, I'm feeling completely defeated. Nothing seems to work and I go to bed every night afraid that I'm just going to repeat the cycle and ruin my sleeping schedule even more. I should also note that I have anxiety and often these nights where I constantly worry don't exactly help my mental state. I think it's a part of my problem since I'm noticing I'll have a tight chest and my heart rate will go up as if I'm on the verge of a panic attack.Is there anything I should try? I've tried every technique I can think of (mediate, not use electronics before bed, read, warm showers, exercise during the day, sleepytime podcast, white noise, pretty much everything anyone's ever suggested to me) and it usually doesn't work. I know I'm only doing these things because I'm having a hard time sleeping, which will remind me that I'm not asleep and make me worry. I'm planning on calling my doctor and letting him know these meds aren't doing shit for me, but I'm honestly at my wit's end and would love any suggestions you guys might have. Thank you.
Signal	3:30 AM as im writing this. I guess i should’ve see it coming, im too anxious right now. Tried to medidate, didnt work. when it happens im just so scared its gonna go back to how it was 2 weeks ago (multiple sleepless nights per week & only sleeping for 1 or 2 hours per night. seems like since i have insomnia, I don’t feel as sleepy as I was before that. i guess i just needed to vent, to maybe get some ressurance. I don’t know what do to. Has anyone any tips & tricks on how to lower anxiety, to get it under control? What do you tell yourselves to regain confidence?
Signal	Struggle with sleep maintenance insomnia... usually no trouble falling asleep initially but waking repeatedly and struggling to get back to sleep after a few hours... then sleep doesn’t feel like sleep.2 months on Ambien (10mg) and Mirtazapine (30mg). Doctor won’t (or hasn’t) prescribed Ambien XR, but recommends splitting and taking 5mg before bed and 5mg when I wake up in the night (usually around 2:30am). Does anyone have experience with XR? Would you recommend trying?
NotSignal	First of all, my insomnia is not “staying up till 3-4am”, it’s staying up the entire night and the day after, and the day after. Get sleep every 4 days(my body crash) and repeat the cycle. Only ambien works, no otc would work.With that said I have tried a variety of methods. I thought Hypnotherapy works for me at first. But it stopped working after a week. Recently I tried CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) for 3 weeks. First week was brutal. Could not sleep at all. 2nd week I sleep 4-5 hours/day. Takes 1 hr to sleep. 3rd week I have been sleeping 7 hours every night. Takes less than 5 mins to get to sleep. And no I do not take ambien. I quit cold turkey.Its cheap, It’s effective. The trick is your will to stick to the schedule and trust the system. I waited 3 weeks because I dont want to share something that comes and go. I did went to see a psychiatrist at the same time and he gave me something to practice, and it helps. Other than these 2 exercise it wasnt much more info. 1/ when you go to bed, imagine yourself on a meadow, underneath an oak tree, looking over a small hill. Underneath the hill, very close to you, there is a stream flowing over the peddles. Imagine how clear the stream is. Imagine the sounds it makes. Now imagine there are a few leaves that fall on the stream. Imagine the shape of the leaves. Look at the leaves, but dont pick any of them up. Let them flow with the stream, one by one. Just look at them flow.2/ when you wake up in the middle of the night. The only thing that you should think about is how cool and soft your pillow is( even when you go to pee) Imagine the feel of your pillow case on your cheek, keep that in your head.3/ keep a strict schedule with the cbt. They will tell you when to go to sleep and when to wake up. Ex: they ll tell you to go to sleep at 3am and wake up at 7am. If you cant sleep until 6am, you still have to wake up at 7am. If you stay up till 7, you must not sleep after that. It WILL work. It WILL take at least 2 weeks to work. Be patient, be disciplined. 4/ get at least 15-30 mins of sunshine per day. What I do is when I get up in the morning, I take a walk for 15-20 mins under the sun. So your body get used to whats day and night.Let me know if you have any questions. Hope it helps.
NotSignal	Hello fellow Redditors,I have troubles with falling asleep and staying asleep, but a lot of times I am really tired.Most of the time I feel like I am too tired to do anything, so then I decide to take a nap. But than I can't fall asleep and will waste a lot of time just laying there. This is a viscious cycle for me. I also never feel refreshed upon waking up. Often I'll waste hours trying to sleep again.Should I just stop trying to fall asleep? My brain is sending me a lot of mixed messages about this and I don't know what would be wise.
Signal	haven't slept at all last night and this morning. been trying to break this pattern over the last few months but can't seem to actually do it. it's 6:46 at the time i'm writing this and can't fall asleep. it's almost sunrise and i can't shut my eyes, uncomfortable bed, loud noises, and the urge to stay awake. hope this all ends soon.
NotSignal	Since about 1 year I have been experiencing insomnia, on and off, and I have been going insane trying to understand why this is happening and why I am also feeling like shit etc. I am not depressed, I don't feel particularly stressed and I do not take any extreme caffeine/tea dosages during the day. I'd go to bed regularly around 23:00ish and I'd wake up at silly o'clock and could not sleep anymore. I suffer from IBS/SIBO my guts are leaky and most likely are failing to filter and absorb vital nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. I have come to the conclusion that my insomnia is related to the lack of these vital nutrients and now I am going to take daily supplements and see what happens. Curious if any of you out there has come to the same conclusion and how you are treating it or coping with it.
NotSignal	I get mini anxiety attacks whenever i try to fall asleep. My head starts to run and the only thought that runs through my head is “when will you fall asleep?” and it gets louder and louder until i give up trying to sleep. im getting 1-2 hours a night.
Signal	I’m not sure if I have insomnia because I’ve just learned what it met but I do know I have sleeping problems. Starting from 7th grade I have always had trouble sleeping at night like waiting an hour or more to finally hit the hay then waking up 1 hour earlier than I need to. However the past few months just consisted of multiple nights of not sleeping at all, feeling so tired but not being able to sleep. To balance it my body feels tired during the day and it takes a 4-5 hour nap that really consumes the whole day. I’m concerned about this cycle because I know that sleeping is a big factor to growing and I don’t want to interfere with it during these crucial growing years. If y’all can help me to fix this ordeal I would really be grateful :D
Signal	I’ve been taking this med for a week and a half and I knew about the side effects. I thought I wouldn’t happen to me for some reason... and last night, I sent a bunch of hectic snaps to a lot of my friends and I have absolutely no memory about doing so. So frankly, nothing bad happened. However I’m scared it’s going to get worse over the time... I took it 40 mn ago and I start feeling slightly high/drunk as usual. I’m scared I’m going to go further and potentially endanger myself/others... any experience with this med ?
NotSignal	Jus chiming in here saying hey to the rest of normal people. No sleep here for 36 hours and counting. Had a few stints of over 40hrs of no sleep in the past cpl months. Hoping the 2wk stand doesnt happen again.
Signal	For me, it comes in cycles. Sometimes these cycles last for weeks and even months, and then other times it lasts for only a day or two.During my rough periods, I can get anywhere from 0-4 hours of sleep per night. I get constant bad headaches and feel tired all the time. My insomnia stems from anxiety about not sleeping and an OCD I have (I won’t disclose more since I don’t want it to be a trigger for anybody else). Luckily, I can have good stretches of where I average around 6-7 hours of sleep per night, but as I mentioned everything comes in cycles for me. The good and bad times are probably close to an even 50/50 split. This has been going on for about 4 years. I have been taking melatonin, trazadone, and zzquil as sleep aides (not all together). I have also been doing CBT for the past 10 months and it has helped somewhat but I still struggle a lot. Sometimes I resort to alcohol to get me to sleep (not a good decision I know). I have been getting better at cutting that down though.What about you guys?
NotSignal	Lookin at the my phone it’s 3am, I tell myself one more hour n I’ll sleep.Time passes and it’s now 6am. Its light outside, everyone’s waking up for work, I smoke a joint and then try sleep again.It’s now 8am. Is it worth me trying to even sleep? I’ve been sat in bed and it’s 11am, I’ve been trying to sleep for 3 hours. I worked out, walked my dog had a smoke and I still CANT sleep.
NotSignal	After months of not being able to sleep properly, these pass 2 weeks I made a breakthrough of being able to sleep well. But just my luck tonight I wasn’t able to sleep one bit tonight. TL;DR: anxiety is preventing me from sleeping and I want to know how I can get through the day with no sleep.Background:When I was about to fall asleep, I kept hearing noises that sounded like someone was typing really fast on a keyboard. This prevent me from sleeping and scared me because I thought it was a ghost that was punishing me for bad thoughts (Crazy, I know). an hour later I found it was a mouse making all that noise. But all that noise and fear has made me so anxious that I’m scared to fall asleep because now my brain thinks That the noise will start again if I try to fall asleep. I have Lorazepam but I don’t want to take it because it makes me vomit. If I start vomiting outside or in the subway, people will think I’m sick with COVID or something. I have to wake up in less than 4 hours, it would be hard for me to sleep anyway now since I know I have to wake up soon. I’m really upset that this BS had to happens tonight.
Signal	i don’t understand what i’m feeling, please help mei haven’t had proper sleep for months now and it’s because i have these unnecessary fears. one of which is that, i’m scared that i might just pass away in my sleep, especially during the nights when my heart doesn’t feel right. second, i’m scared that when i wake up, i’d have forgotten who i am, where i am, and the people around me. these thoughts are keeping me from getting proper sleep. i’d feel anxious, my heart would start racing, and my hands would start shaking in the middle of the night. i really don’t know what to do anymore. i just want proper sleep. does anyone feel this way too? what do you guys do?
NotSignal	I have been struggling with sleep for the past year, lately it has become much worse. It's now 4 am, for the past 3 weeks, most of the nights I go to bed between 12-2 am but cannot fall asleep until 7-9 am and then only sleep for the little time left before 10 am. Eventually I stay up until the next day, the cycle gets a little better but I wake up middle of night after 4 hours sleep.Please help me with your suggestions, techniques and long term fixes. I am going insane and feeling like I'm going to burnout from life in general
NotSignal	One day I get to sleep 12 pm and the day after I sleep like 1-3 hours. This have happened every day the last two weeks. Is this a kind of insomnia?
NotSignal	Hi all, time to time i need half of a sleeping pill i got from my doctor. It usually takes 30 mins to kick in. During those 30 mins, i cleanup after dinner, prepare my self for bed and set up my aromatic diffuser. I was already feeling my body acting silly, like dragging and stumbling so it was time for mr to get in bed, but my dog suddenly got sick and puke all over, my boyfriend took him out and i stayed home cleaning... i literally felt high, like, cleaning barf should be so something disgusting that you get mad at but there i was enjoying myself cleaning bile.. im back to bed now (my dog is ok, he somethuf does this vecause he ates to fast, we are tatking measures so dont worry about him) anyways, im no here in bed, i feel drunk and flying, theres tea tree oil smell around, I've neve never experienced being awake while taking sleeping pills, is like woooww! Probably the best experience I've had since all this quarantine started, i somehow feel free aand relaz again... i dont know. Does this makes sense? Anyone else can relate to this experience??Now im gonna try to sleep but wanted ti drag this freling a bit longer so what better place than Reddit LOL...
NotSignal	I posted my story on Snapchat to some friends who live far away and one brilliant woman shared this: there’s an app called slumber. Some of its free, some you have to pay for. There’s a sound on the main page called leaf in a stream and i loop it twice then have the background music continue for another hour after sound ends. This woman’s voice is magical, I swear! Try to focus on her voice and you will be asleep sooo fast. Good luck!
Signal	Who has no problem falling asleep, but wakes up multiple times during the night every night? Oh, and feels tired as hell during the next day? I just don't want to feel alone...
