Signal	Has anybody here tried this medication? I recently got a script for 10mg once before bed. When I tried it I felt like I wasn’t myself until about 5 pm the next day. I felt deeply anxious about being touched, and felt like my cognitive abilities were severely impaired. Does this go away? Does it work for anyone else? Should I try to power through it?Background: I’ve had chronic insomnia for around a decade, the only medication that’s really worked for me was ambien (zolpidem). The other fix was working 12-18 hours a day, which is hard to replicate since I’ve been laid off.
Signal	So for the past 4-5 days I have been getting better sleep. Usually getting 6-8 hours now. What I do is eat dinner at 6:00pm then let the food digest, at 9:00 I eat oatmeal and banana since my doctor says that both meal creates serotonin and melatonin, walk around for 30 minutes to digest food, take 3mg melatonin at 9:30, sleep at 10:00pm then boom sleep but wakes up at 3am but no problem since I fall back asleep anyways. Works for me.
NotSignal	its keeping me up all night and im just quietly panicking. i owe $10,000 and my mind is just racing im trying so hard to distract myself on my phone but its not working.. i wish the universe would give me a break
Signal	So I just subbed today. I want to describe my experience and get some advice.So my problem is it takes me hours and hours of lying in the dark to fall asleep, and then I sleep heavy. Light and sound struggle to wake me. My fancy vibrating alarm clock just manages. But then... when I wake up I summon the minimum amount of consciousness possible to turn off my alarms and go back to sleep. My strategy has been duct taping my alarm clock so the switch is harder to get to. Then wrapping my alarm clock in multiple plastic bags and tying multiple knots to make it much harder for me to get at. Recently my zombie self has managed to overcome these so I'm buying a second bell alarm clock and a fitness tracker which has a vibrating alarm and sleep tracker. I try to get in bed at 12 every night. I exercise (usually in the day time). I stopped smoking weed. I don't drink coffee in the evening. I try to get up at the same time every day. I'm constantly exhausted. Even if I fall asleep at a decent time I'll wake up 1 or 2 times during the night. I'm late for work and probably going to lose my job.I feel like I'm trying my best to fix this but it's so hard and it's been this way since I was a teenager. When I was living with family or girlfriends who could help me out it wasn't so bad but now I live alone. What do you suggest trying next? Should I start the process of trying different medications? How long do you try something for before deciding it doesn't work? I tried some "natural" medications before and they would either make it harder to wake up or just make me drowsy for a bit but not put me to sleep.What medications are popular to try? What do most people find effective? Anything else I should be doing?
Signal	when you've soaked your feet in hot water, popped 5mg of melatonin 30 minutes to an hour before bed, shot your neighbor's dog, listened to michael sealey's smooth, buttery voice on repeat and you're still awake even though you did bedtime yoga and limited blue light exposure an hour before bedtime. it's 2:15am. you went to bed at 11:45pm. *god why do you hate me so*, you wail. you notice how unusually shallow your breaths are. oxygen deprivation can cause dark circles. oh god your skin has been looking sallow. you breathe. hard. with your diaphragm. actively. 3:30am. *fuck*
NotSignal	I've had this issue for quite a while now. I do tend to think a lot when i'm trying to fall asleep but the my concern is the thoughts happen when i'm already asleep. I'm prone to having nightmares too but I also have thoughts that wake me up. It's like my brain searches for new problems while i'm asleep. The things I think about wouldn't usually be a big deal but if they come to me in my sleep they become quite detrimental and I will fixate on them for days and it becomes quite distressing. Just one of these thoughts is enough to set off my anxiety and my mental health falls apart.
NotSignal	Background: Yesterday (Sunday, 19th April) I woke up at around 2 pm. I spent 3-4 hours of my day trying to complete a challenge (MG34 mastery IV) in Battlefield V. I did finally complete it around 7:30 pm. I have been at it for over 2 days. When i completed, i did close my console, because i didnt want to involuntarily force myself into another challenge and get frustrated. After dinner, me and wifey watched an episode of supernatural. While show was still running, I opened up editing software and started editing my challenge footage. This took a while, i was not sleepy. I went to bed after 00:45 am today. The usual dream: I dream about the game i am playing a lot, just like most people who play too much of any game. I used to get such dreams when i play a game for a really long time before sleep. Recently i have been getting such dreams even when i spend 4-5 hours in a game (witcher 3). The worst thing about such dreams is how my brain is actually active when it is happening. There is no rest, no down time, my brain is actively engaging in the game and solving it during the dream. This always disturbs my sleep or causes me to lose sleep. Because witcher 3 was giving me such dreams, i didnt even touch it yesterday. Instead focused on BF V. But so many deaths and frustrations before i could complete the challenge. But i did finally complete it.Today's dream: Today i dreamt about battlefield. I kept dying. I kept respawning. And after a while there was a manifestation on the skies. Like someone stirred the skies. I was inside it. I looked up and said, "Dormammu i've come to bargain". And kept repeating this act everytime i died. Until I woke up. Venting:I think I woke up hours back. When I first saw the time it was past 5 am, now it is past 6 am. I hate that i had yet another sleepless night before a working day. Have to start working in another 3.5 hours.Note: I havent slept well on working days for the past two weeks. Probably longer, but i cant remember. Before two weeks, my wife used to brush my hair with her fingers till i fall asleep (sometimes for hours). But it doesnt work anymore.
Signal	So my friend always tell me almost every night that he can't sleep, at least not immediately, I've tried giving him a bunch of suggestions from my experience yet none of them work. I think he's being anxious about this thing, and he's going to sleep with that "I won't get any sleep" attitude... He has to go to work early from monday to Saturday, so he needs sleep ! I don't how to help him, he tried medications before, he doesn't want to get addicted to them, he says maybe he'll get some tomorrow, because this situation is almost constant and it's been like that for a while... So any suggestions pleaaaase....
NotSignal	Recently my insomnia has been paired with very severe night sweats. At this point, I’m terrified to even go to bed it’s such a horrifying experience 9/10 nights. I googled night sweats and it scared me even more I heard someone say something about a heart infection and diabetes. Anyone else have night sweats?
Signal	So I’ve been struggling with sleep for ages. One time I feel asleep in the toilet of my school probably microsleeping and didn’t know where I was for a second when I woke up 😂. I continuously can’t fall asleep till 2am-4am each night and function on very limited rest. In the U.K. melatonin is under prescription and I don’t really want to talk to my gp. I’ve tried kalms tablets basically useless, and lavender spray (totally useless). Does anyone know anything other than kalms that you can get. Also anyone got any tips. I also start uni soon and I expect my workload to keep me up late too and the fact it takes like 4 hours to fall asleep isn’t going to help.
Signal	I have not had consistent sleep for past 2 weeks. Per night maybe an average of 3 hours , consistently interrupted/wake up. I believe it's due to stress of thinking I won't ever be able to sleep again and ruin my life. I have tried melatonin 3mg for 4 or 5 nights , it does make me less stressed at night but doesn't help me get really much sleep.I'm speaking to my physician tomorrow but I feel he will prescribe sleeping pills , which I would like to avoid if I can help itAnother option I just found is CBT( cognitive behavioral therapy) Phycologist. I've never had sessions with any Phycologist before in my life.If anyone here sounds like they were in a similar position and tried a CBT Phycologist. How was your experience ? Did it work ? I had a consultation with one and he said in 3 or 4 sessions I could likely have my issue resolved. Gives me hope but I'm pretty skeptical
Signal	I've struggled with sleep since childhood and have done everything under the sun. Now I'm finally sleeping better most nights, even without meds (which I was on for decades). I’m 54 and going through menopause and I am sleeping better now than when I was in my 30s.Here is what I can share:Stop struggling and trying to force yourself to sleep. Notice how focused you are on the fact that you sleep poorly. You might talk about it, post about it, read about it, ruminate, etc. You doctor shop and try supplements and they might work for a little while. You think about sleeping even in the middle of the day and start dreading going to bed. You have rituals- maybe you stop using your phone, or you do yoga, or you take sleeping pills, or up your other meds, etc. However, none of this works and you still have shitty nights.So now you're going to try something new. There ARE people who don't struggle with sleep, believe it or not. So what exactly are they doing that you don't?Well, they go to bed and just sleep. They don't do anything special.So my tip for you is to learn to act like someone who doesn't struggle with sleep. Go to bed and lay there. Do nothing. Yes, your anxiety will kick in. Be prepared to face it head on for at least a few weeks. Especially if you've struggled for a long time. Anxiety is a phantom, there is nothing on the other side. Resist it and it gets worse. Face it, and it goes away. Guess what? Lack of sleep, while very unpleasant, won't kill you. You can survive on very little sleep. (You already do this, right?) When I finally understood this, it took a lot of the pressure off me. So lay there and don't expect to sleep just yet, but do enjoy getting delicious rest. Your body still benefits from resting and while you lay there resting, you are very likely drifting into light sleep. So you actually are sleeping here and there even though you may feel certain that you're not.Lay there and feel your body sensations. Be mindful of your breath. Watch your anxiety wash over you. But give yourself full permission to just rest- make no demands on yourself to sleep.No matter what. I guarantee, once you stop struggling so much to sleep, you will have better nights. Once you give yourself permission to just lay there and rest, you will find you might even enjoy laying there. I never thought I would say this, but I now actually look forward to bedtime. I still wake up a few times a night, but most nights, since I am not struggling or trying to force sleep, I am better rested and it’s made a huge difference.I hope this helps someone.
Signal	Started off with Lindsay but it ended up costing 50 cents a night. Then was on Ambien for a while, to the point where I got addicted. It was easy to kick, then would get another 3 months scripts and get addicted again. Now my doctor won't prescribe it for more than a month at a time. I have been taking 3 Tylenol pms. Melatonin gives me horrible dreams. I would like to get back on Ambien because even if it was addictive i felt fine. Is long term use of Tylenol on dangerous?
NotSignal	I literally cannot sleep anymoreNot in the last few daysWhen I do it's because I pass out, and even then it's only for about 2 hoursWhen I wake up I have a painful headache for a few hoursIt probably has to do with deppression
NotSignal	I got no sleep last night and it’s 2:40am now I just wanna sleep so bad but I can’t, I’m legit crying rn idc
NotSignal	Jokes on them. I don’t sleep for more than 5 hours so they had a nice 6am wake up call that included a speaker blaring upwards underneath their bedroom, dropping my 20lb medicine ball from 6 ft onto hardwood, and the classic stomping around/slamming doors Cathartic God I want to sleep
NotSignal	Hi everyone 👋I joined r/sleep last week and thought I'd make myself available here as well. Getting reliable and scientifically sound information regarding sleep and it’s connections to the mind and body can be cumbersome. Oftentimes people will provide answers to sleep-related questions that do not really hold up when tested against medical research.I’d like to help provide some clarity and resolution to sleep questions/concerns. I can’t diagnose or medically advise anything here, but the educational value may help some of you.Insomnia, daytime sleepiness, nightmares, anxiety/busy minds, etc. I help my patients diagnose and treat the full spectrum of sleep symptoms with holistic, non-pharmaceutical treatment. So I’m here for you on Reddit as well 👍<using personal account for practicing sleep specialist Amer Khan, MD.>
NotSignal	Does anybody else feel that if sleep wasn’t such an important thing for immune system and brain our mental health would be much better if we didn’t need sleep we wouldn’t be obsessed about fatal stuff. If humans / science find a way and alternative to sleep the world would be such a peaceful place .
Signal	Just a quick rant , i wish for once just one night a week I would be tired enough to hit my bed and pass out. I hate that I have to stop using phone/tv hours before bed, exercise, read, meditate, take supplements, not sit on my bed all day listen to calming music, take a hot shower etc. and literally try to fall asleep. Half the time I do all these things and still dont fall asleep. Sorry for the rant
Signal	I feel like the "potency" of my insomnia is worsening, even tho the frequency of it has been relatively lower than normal. Instead of having multiple bad nights a week I've been able to reduce it down to just one or in some cases no bad nights, mostly by taking more time to relax before bed. The problem though is that my anxiety is worse than its ever been for reasons unknown and it just effectively shatters my ability to sleep. Yesterday night I couldn't sleep at all for literally no reason, and altho I'm tired right before bed the instant I actually get in bed it's like my brain forgets how to sleep and this loop begins now where I'm up again, freaking out. My head starts to hurt and I feel a sort of "mental ripple" going through it and I don't know what to do. Before when my insomnia was more frequent it had more obvious stressors, and at the very least I'd typically pass out around 5 AM or so, but now I'm up for over 24 hour cycles and there's zero indication of anything wrong (I've already improved my sleep hygiene to combat it) and everything that's worked in the past (exercise, reading before bed, supplements) is now basically doing jack shit. I feel like my head is going to cave in. Why the hell isn't my brain MORE tired now? Why does it randomly stop functioning right as I'm trying to sleep? It seriously feels like the "sleep chemical" is just absent from my brain entirely, and taking melatonin isn't doing anything.
NotSignal	If I know I have something important to do the next day, my body will not let me relax for even an hours sleep. And I won't feel tired that day neither. What is worgs with me?
Signal	I’ve recently started taking the 7.5MG dose, and I’ve been suffering from a almost rancid taste in my mouth that lingers well into the next day. I’ve tried multiple methods to help reduce the after taste. I.e taking it with food, milk, lots of water, brushing my teeth before taking it, brushing my teeth after taking it, etc but nothing seems to help. Does anyone else have this, and if you do; how do you manage/get rid of it?
NotSignal	Apologies in advance for improper grammar and spelling; I can't think straight right now. I'm really stressed out right now. I haven't slept in over a day or two now, I think, I can't really remember anymore. I'm dealing with a really painful recovery from a corrective surgery I had on Feb 14th and the pain is keeping me from sleeping. I'm getting very shakey and weak and it's hard to stand with out having my vision fade out but even when I try to sleep, pain keeps from getting comfortable. I feel like eventually, my body will force me to sleep, at least I hope. Have any tips on how I should cope with so little sleep?
Signal	In high school I was prescribed trazodone for sleep, it changed my life so much. Everything got so much better, I wasn't so exhausted anymore.I've been on it for 6 or 7 years now. When I don't take it (I'm not home or fall asleep without) I sleep poorly. I wake up exhausted. Sometimes I can't sleep because I'm so anxious of not sleeping well without it.I'm worried about long term consequences for not only the use, but that anxiety and dependancy. I take 75mg a night.Opinions? Thoughts?Anyone else been on it for this long?
NotSignal	The human body, man. It can do so much, except sleep.
NotSignal	I've been on 1MG mirtazapine for 12 years and it works great for me. I have mild insomnia and can't take heavy duty hypnotics or herbs due to side effects. I'm really glad I found low dose mirtazapine since it act as an antihistamine (H1 antagonist) not a hypnotic (Serotonin/GABA antagonist). Its sort of a side effect free sleep aid. The perfect sleep med for me and I never developed dependence.Playing with mirtazapine doses: Lately 1MG has not been doing its job so I tried 2MG and that was too strong. Turns out, right now 1.5MG is perfect.Trying doxepin:I just got a script for doxepin liquid to compare and try something new. It seems 1 drop is roughly 1MG so I will two drops and see how it works.Does anyone have experience with doxepin? What dose did you like and where there side effects?
Signal	Hey so long story short I always struggled with sleep even as a kid, after a bad panic attack I developped anxiety over sleeping that never goes away, I try to sleep but I am too anxious and it keeps me awake, I take hydroxyzine and melatonin but it don’t help, my psychiatrist want me to test an ad but I’m so scared.Does anyone has a story with antidepressant helping with anxiety ? (Not panic attack)Last night I didn’t slept even one hour,I’m still awake and cant sleep.The problem is getting bigger, usually I call my gf and it helps but she don’t want to answer at 5am crying calls which I can understand..Please help me, I tried meditation, breathing exercise, reading....I need to sleep
Signal	I'm tired. So tired. I'm dizzy from being tired but I can't fall asleep. For weeks. I wake up after a couple hours and that's it. Idk what to do
Signal	So I can’t sleep and I’m getting tired of trying. Every time I try I either get a headache or I just can’t. I live in a house with other people, but I have my own room. What are some quiet activities I can do and not wake them up?
NotSignal	And I just ate an entire cucumber. Like, I peeled it, and just fucking ate it.My shower earlier was not relaxing. I felt paranoia. Looking in the mirror also wasnt much fun.. I just.. idk. Wanted to squeak here for a second. I can’t get my trazodone yet. Stupid COVID. Slowing everything down.Guys, stay strong. We can make it. “Til sunrise, and beyond.”
Signal	Well, another sleepless night for me- It’s 6:30 am and I have been tossing and turning all night since around 1. The longer the clock ticks, the worse my anxiety gets knowing with each hour that passes, I’m losing that precious energy needed to make it through a full work day without dreading every minute of it. I recently found out that the mattress I have been sleeping on for 3 months, caused me to have debilitating chest and upper back pain. I went to an urgent care a month ago after many days fretting about the pain and wondering if I was having heart problems. They gave me muscle relaxers and an anti inflammatory.. Which helped until I was done taking them. A week goes by and the pain slowly starts to come and I was just stressed to the max, worrying about my heart, on top of all other external stressors. So I decided to go back to the clinic yesterday- To take an EKG and thankfully, no heart issues popped up. However, I put two and two together and realized that my bed is so soft that my whole body basically sinks in every time I’m laying down. These past 3 months, I’ve tried to stay positive about the shitty mattress my landlord refuses to switch out bc I knew staying here was only temporary. The amount of anxiety, lack of sleep, and confusion I’ve experienced almost makes me wish I could take it all back. I feel so alone in this- I walk into work just totally dazed. Crossing my fingers that no one attempts to say anymore than two words to me. It hurts to talk, and the thing is.. I actually do like my job and the people I work with- But when I’m sleep deprived I don’t want to talk to anyone, All I want is to sit at my desk and get the day over with so I can weakly crawl back into bed immediately after. It’s times like these that memories of being a kid come rushing back to me- I wish I could go back in time and just experience feeling alive at sunrise, energized and excited to start the day. I plan on moving out of this furnished apartment by the 1st with a new bed, but until then- Any tips or words of encouragement from someone who understands would be greatly appreciated 🙏
Signal	Hey everyone,I’m a 21F. So I used to always sleep 7-8 hours straight through with no problems and always woke up at the same time. Then last year the problem started where I would wake up after a few hours but this seemed due to external factors like temperature, noise etc and I always fell back asleep within an hour or two so I was okay. Recently with quarantine, however, the problem has gotten much worse. Almost every night I wake up after four hours and it takes me hours to fall back asleep so I have to stay in bed for 10-12 hours in order to get a normal amount of sleep. Some nights I just can’t fall back asleep even though I’m really sleepy because I’m so stressed out and upset about waking up. I tried OTC meds but they didn’t work and just made me groggy during the day. I tell myself to relax rather than try and sleep and not to worry if I don’t get enough sleep because will be okay but it doesn’t always work. I also don’t consume caffeine before bed and if I drink alcohol it’s a small amount. And I could get up to do something if I can’t fall asleep right away but I don’t think it would make a difference because I’m always sleepy enough to fall back asleep, my brains thoughts just run wild at night and I get upset at the fact that I’m even awake and it makes it hard to fall back asleep so even if I go do something when I go back into bed I feel like the same thing will happen. Any advice is appreciated, thanks :).
Signal	I haven’t been able to get a good nights sleep since the Thursday I woke up. I mean literally no hours of sleep. I was trying to sleep last night, I thought I’d sleep early since I didn’t sleep at all. Boy was I wrong! I ended up having a panic attack. I’m so anxious as I’ve never been this many hours without sleep and whenever I try to sleep now, it’s as if I’m awake but asleep? I am conscious of everything, I can hear everything but my body is pretty much gone (difficult to move) and also my eyes are shut and hard to open. Plz can someone help???!!!!
NotSignal	I don’t know what’s been wrong with me lately but staying all night until the next night on days off has become something I used to maybe once a month just to fix everything I’ve done it three times since Christmas night and it’s just starting to not work anymore, I’ve been in this awful cycle of going to bed at 7am and waking up at 12pm and I hate it, I use the loudest alarm app and have tried Ambien, flexeril, vistaril, melatonin, zzzquil, weed, nothing works anymore and I’ve been up for 36 hours at thus point and am so tired but can’t go to sleep but I was exhausted earlier today after a coffee at 10am I totally could have taken a nap but I lay down and immediately my breathing is weird and my mind starts to race and it’s driving me insane. I’m having crying spells and I just don’t even feel like I’m really here anymore just floating.
NotSignal	I suffer from reeeeally bad insomnia. My boyfriend can sleep 24 hours if i dont wake him up. I sleep better without him and i dont know why. However, for the first 8 months of our relationship i just ignored it bc i wanted to spend every waking moment with him. Well, now, a little more than a year has past since we started dating and i started to sleep more at my place because i could relax more at home. He knows about my insomnia and i have told him about my struggles. However he is insecure and has convinced himself despite my numerous explanations, that i dont like spending time at his place any more. Now i have to force myself to sleep at his place because i dont want him to be insecure.Does anyone have any advice on a better way of explaining him why its so hard for me without hurting his feelings?
NotSignal	My primary physician is apparently tired of me and does not want to give me script for sleep. She has referred me to a neurologist. Has anyone else seen a neurologist for insomnia? What am I walking into?
NotSignal	i switched to doxy since i've read before that dph is linked to dementia.doxy makes me really drowsy but doesn't really put me to sleep right away. It's like everything is sleepy but a sliver of mine brain is still awake so i can't fully 'get there'I took diphenhydramine along with it one time out of desperation and it was pretty intense, i've had a lot of psychedelic trips in the past but this still felt strong. Energy/waves streaming out of my body fast. Woke up 3 hours after feeling really intense, like i was on a roller coaster yelling kind of intense (was also feeling it in my dream, super drowsy and trippy) and had trouble dealing with the effects once i've woken up. Nausea lingered the next day.I was very calm (albeit nauseous) the next day though even with shit sleep.Anything to be worried about with doxy?
Signal	I have difficulty falling asleep, but when I actually go into sleep.. I wake up an hour or two prior to my alarm where I find myself not going back to sleep.. What is the cause for this? When I usually sleep late, I end up waking late, but somehow it’s the opposite. I find myself not well rested before work. I’m trying to guess if this is caused by sleep apnea? I will be getting a sleep study done soon. Also, I just got diagnosed with restless leg syndrome. Wonder if that could be that cause.
Signal	I took at 10mg tablet at about 11 pm last night and had afew beers... I slept ok, it took a while to get over, and also I woke up at 5am.Today though, I was up at about 11. Very dozy. Ok for a while, then ended up feeling sleepy at about 3, and had to take a major nap. Like it was irresistible sleepiness. Did I take too big a dose? Is it very bad to take it with alcohol? What time should I take it if it can last that long???
NotSignal	This is the second time this week that I called in sick from not being able to sleep. Idk if letting myself call in will reduce stress and help me get to sleep, or if I'll get used to being up at 3 watching Disney plus. I've been considering just changing my sleeping hoursInstead of sleeping 9-5, maybe sleep 7-3. I can fall asleep, early even, but my body is wide awake at 230.Maybe its just my natural sleeping schedule?
Signal	Since the past few months I've been getting 3-4 hours a night. I've tried everything, melatonin up to 10mg, blacked out room, white noise, ear plugs, eye mask, warm showers/cold Showers, sleep with a fan, magnesium, everything.I've noticed since quitting caffeine it's even harder for me to sleep now. I've also noticed that sometimes the only time I get a good 8-10 hours is if I stay awake for about 30 hours straight.This is ruining my life. What's the next steps? Should I go to the doctor and get tested or get meds?
Signal	I take eatazolam 2mg-2.5 (prosom) a benzo about 2-3 nights a week for persisting insomnia. I was prescribed amitriptyline a few months back. I workout. Wake up early etc. Not much helps..Does this have to be taken every night even for off label use for insomnia. My doc prescribed them to be taken together since I am prone to not feeling effective sedation. Im only asking since it's technically an antidepressant and I dont want to mess w my neurochem too much. I'd rather take one or the other alternating. Still taking either about 2/3 nights a week.
Signal	hello, so a bit of background: i'm 22, and i need 8-9 hours of sleep to function properly. however, because i'm having my summer break my bodyclock's totally screwed. i've been sleeping around 2.30am-4am, more recently 4am, and i sleep from 4am-1pm.the thing is, i wake up angry and irritated every day. no idea why, just feels extremely infuriating to wake up and do things. my mind doesn't want to shut up at night, it doesn't let me sleep. it repeats my fears and thoughts like a broken record. i cringe at my past mistakes over and over again.there are also days where i try to sleep early but it fails too. i slept 16 hours once. and everything just goes downhill. i'm considering getting melatonin or zolpidem, but i'm worried of the side effects.any tips or advice would be great, i hope to get my bodyclock back on track in the next 3 weeks or so. TIA!
Signal	Hey guys usually I get temazepam for my sleep but my phych cancelled on me so I had to go to a random dr. He prescribed me Belsomra and I can't find any info about it really. How is it effective? And what are your experiences ? Thanks
Signal	So I got elbow on my right side of my head when I was playing b-ball. So far I used medicated oil on my head. I also have anxiety. I can’t tell the difference if I have anxiety headache or a real headache. Currently I am in bed and my head feels like it’s burning. I don’t know if that’s from a lot of thinking because earlier I was listening to music and my head was not this hot. I can’t sleep right now.
NotSignal	Hello r/insomnia,I'm trying to explain above (which happens quite a lot in my new apartment and almost daily since maybe 2 months ago). I can usually get back to sleep but not always as I feel 100% refreshed.I live alone and use plugs - no random sound to explain this. Blackout curtain means light also likely isn't it. No caffeine after 4pm (I have no troubles falling asleep at 2). No elevator/loud neighbors.What's crazy is that it almost always happens between 6:15 and 6:45. Last two days it was 6:45 spot.Please help me explain, I think I might be going insane.
Signal	Been an insomniac since I can remember, was taking some meds but my doctor is a piece of shit and needs more $$ so he refuses to fill my rx until i go back in Monday. Copay really that worth it ?? He says I’m bipolar, then he says I’m depressed, then he says I’m insert xyz. Is this guy fucking stupid?? I need something to help me sleep, that’s it...Not really looking for anything here but to vent for a second Hope allR welll.... as well as a mother fucker can be without fucking sleeping ..... ever........
Signal	I know this sounds weird, but if I haven't been sleeping well and notice that I feel tired, this will make me anxious. Even if I get 6-8 hours of sleep and I start to feel tired I get concerned and upset.
NotSignal	What has been ur worst bout of insomnia ? And how long has it lasted ? wondering when mine will stop if it ever will :)
NotSignal	So I just spent the entire night awake while laying in bed. This hasn't happened to me before, but there have been times where it's taken me a few hours of laying in bed to fall asleep, especially when I'm anticipating something big or have a lot on my mind. It's never been as bad as this though. Is this something I should contact a professional about or just write off as a one-off sort of thing?
NotSignal	It’s just a reminder that my sleep cycle is awful, lmao. It makes me feel like it’s too late (early?) to even try to sleep. Go screw yourselves, birds.
NotSignal	Insomnia is a blanket term. I don’t go sleepless for days. I sleep every night. But sometimes it can take hours to fall asleep which often can ruin the next day if I have something important to do. Also waking up is always a pain. Unless you’re a complete morning person waking up sucks for most people. But I just can’t imagine that it’s supposed to be this hard. I feel paralysed when waking up. Completely dead. Anybody here just have casual trouble sleeping? What are your best tips?
Signal	Oh wow I can’t sleep how expected it’s not like this got old the 582nd time its happened. To be honest I’m bored as hell I think I’m gonna walk around the house for a bit. 4am? I’ve been in this bed for 5 hours? Just laying here doing nothing. For 5 hours. I can’t even stand 20 minutes of a period at school but this. Damn. There’s been no resolve in doing this I think I might just stay up for the rest of the night. I’ll try reset my cycle tomorrow night. Honestly wish there was some sort of table that knocks you out instantly regardless and keeps you asleep.
NotSignal	I’ve brought some books out tonight, Tolkien and Donaldson, hmmmm. I’m on mirtazapine so I look like a hoose end, feel like one too!I’ve made two soups tonight; sweet pepper, tomato and lentil. I didn’t realise that Worcestershire sauce wasn’t vegan!There’s none in it!The other one is the same but I put a pack of bacon in for the stock! And a wee cheeky dash of Worcestershire sauce!Oh!One gets parsley and chilli as garnish.....The other gets toasted cheese/crusty bread floating on top sprinkled with chilli....Music tonight is Gene Loves Jezebel - The Thornfiekd Sessions....Yesterday has gone, accept it! There’s tonight...
Signal	Tired of being awake. Ihave no intetest in doing anything. My husband gets up in like 3 hours. Wondering if I should pull an all nighter.Im on zyprexa and 4mg xanax!
NotSignal	Yep, I feel like impulsive me might have an inevitable suicide. My mind wont ever shut the fuck up, any tips?
NotSignal	I can't sleep. My brain doesn't shut up. It's been days I slept. I love sleep. But can't sleep. It's the worst.. what do I do.. I wannaaaaaa sleeeeppp
Signal	So I've been trying out more medications with my GP while simultaneously working hard to improve my quality of life during the day (healthy meals, social interactions, stressor removal, light exercise, etc.)While before I had to stack medications and take higher doses, I'm realizing that finding the right medication does wonders. Just a little bit of Lunesta right now puts me out while super high doses of various benzodiazepines did not. (The benzos worked to really relax me and combat my anxiety but not to help with falling asleep; I only fell asleep if the dose was very high.)I'm thinking more and more about my experiences over the past few years with doctors, and psychiatrists more specifically. I'm someone who has mild anxiety but nothing I can't handle naturally during the day. I see complaints all the time from people with mental health disorders remarking on the difficulty of finding daytime medication that helps with their disorder but is not too sedating so they can function. People with insomnia alone don't need a balance so much as sedated = yes/noI think of all the times doctors and psychiatrists kind of shooed me away about lifelong severe (often total) insomnia or just gave me a lot of benzodiazepines. I had one psychiatrist who refused anything other than Seroquel, Trazadone, and/or Klonopin for insomnia. (I'm allergic to the first two.)How difficult was it to just let me experiment like my GP has done to find something that works for my body specifically? Sheesh. She cycled me out through a couple different meds until I found one that worked for me. And wow, it's made a world of difference. I thought before that benzos did well but I still had to stack them to make myself fall asleep, which was not healthy. A drug that works by itself to put you to sleep really opens your eyes to how the proper drug for your body should work.Why can't more doctors be open to seeing what works for their patients?<end rant>
NotSignal	I hate this i cant stop thinking about parts of my body touching each other my fingers my toes my legs. Ive been up for about 20 hours sleep seems impossible i have to be at work in 6 hours i hate not having anything to deal with this.
Signal	Before high school, I wasn't necessary the happiest or slept that well either. But after, it's like it just multiplied in intensity by a hundred. I had to get up at around 6 in order to get ready and be their by 7. But really I would always wake up at 5 instead. So it's not like I was going to try and sleep for one more hour... And if I did It would make me more tired. I usually went to bed at around 10 or 11. But it takes me an hour or sometimes two in order to fall asleep. So usually I would only actually fall asleep at 12 which only gives me 5 hours of sleep if I wake up at 5. And even 6 is not good if I maybe managed to fall asleep at 11. But anyways now even like 2 years after highschool I've noticed my sleep seems even worse than before. I can't sleep anymore that 4 hour intervels. I'll go to bed at say 12. And I'll wake up at 4 or 3. It will usually never be more than 4 hour intervels. Then I go back to bed but usually only sleep for 2 or 3. I haven't had 8 hours of straight sleep for years. I think if that could happen my whole life would turn around. My anxiety would decrease, I would be happier, and I would finally just have energy. Also, in highschool I also didn't mention how anxious I felt and that's also terrible for sleep. So it's honestly just a viscous cycle that you cant get out of once you start.I really think they need to change the school timing because then I really wouldn't have minded it at all. It could have started at 9 and end at 4 instead of 7 to 2. That's not even the hours of a work day. It actually could end at 3 if they just cut 1 hour off they don't need... Each class only needs to be an hour. School is way to long in general. And for a growing adolescent you need sleep. the ages 14- 18 (highschool ages) are honestly the most important ages of development but that's when things get screwy in life.
NotSignal	These last few days have been awful. If I fall asleep within the next hour, by the time I wake up I’ll have had 8(?) hours of sleep within the past 3 days. School drains me so much. There are no classes I can afford to fall asleep in, and it’s not like I’d be able to fall asleep anyway. Every single week I feel very sleep deprived and emotionally exhausted by Wednesday. I can’t wait until it’s summer and I can be fully conscious and awake for more than a weekend. Not sure if this post and the last one I’ve made even make sense, I’m kinda just spilling some of my thoughts into a post and deleting the stuff that doesn’t fit in with what I’m writing/with this subreddit.
Signal	I’m starting SRT. My wife tosses and turns a lot in bed though. It’s woken me up in the past, even when I was a good /normal sleeper. But back then I was able to just let it go and go back to sleep. And I always slept 7-8 hours still. Now I’m starting SRT and struggling with insomnia/ loss of sleep confidence. I find when I’m drifting off now, her tossing and turning prevents me from falling asleep. This can happen many, many times in a row to where I think I would have fallen asleep if it weren’t for her moving around and pulling blankets etc. i end up getting very frustrated and it sends me into a tailspin. In the moment then I get angry / anxious thinking I might be sleeping if it weren’t for her. I can go and sleep in the spare room, but I don’t know if this is a bad idea? Is it setting me up for failure when I need to go back to bed sharing? I can’t sleep in separate beds my whole life. We’re young and it doesn’t feel right. Plus when we go on vacations etc, I’m not going to have my own bed. So should I tough it out and stay in the same bed, and just have my own anxiety issues plus the physical / stress hurdle of being woken by her occasionally. Or, should I try and build my confidence up in the spare room and then go back to bed sharing (at which point I would need to learn to bed share again AND once again learn to sleep in a new bed again!)
NotSignal	Insomnia.The seconds feel like minutes,The minutes feel like hours,The hours feel like days,Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...It's exhausting, Such a simple form of torture
Signal	im on sedation meds and can't even get 2 hours of sleep..im scared im screwed
NotSignal	Anyone else on bad nights just give up and know you won’t fall asleep? I’ve been having more and more nights not being able to sleep.
NotSignal	Have any men suffering from insomnia experienced their free testosterone’s levels drop? I am 20 and have had a lot of sleeping problems for a while and my test. levels came back as 389 ng/dL. Is this a normal for my age? My doctor said it’s fine because it’s in the clinically accented range but I feel like for a male my age it should be double that. Everything else about my blood work was fine. Moreover, if sleep is the reason why it fell, would correcting my sleep eventually bring it back up?
NotSignal	Fellow insomniac here. I have multiple restrictions on my phone from my father. And I’m always forced to go to sleep, otherwise I’ll have questions as to why I’m up at 1-4 in the morning even later. I hate being forced to sleep.. sleep is a night mare but also a heaven for me (more so a safe spot) only cuz I don’t have anyone dead naming me, calling me names, or grades to worry about as I sleep. To sum it up.. sleep is difficult for me, but also a heaven. Thank you for reading my little vent
Signal	granted, i didn't do anything much today except tend to my mom's birthday. but the past 2 months have been really tiring, and there are nights (albeit not that frequently) when i get to fall asleep IMMEDIATELY right after finishing papers i have to submit the following day.sleep debt just kept on piling on until i near collapse within a work day 'cause i'm only running under 30-minute naps. now, when i want to make peace with my body, to just...turn itself off so i could enjoy a full night's rest, it's really really fucking frustrating to have done methods to guarantee that.currently listening to this app called relaxio (i'm playing brown tune and meadows sounds at the same time). i already took benadryl so i'm dizzy as hell. and i keep writhing on my bed for absorbing my heat and bombarding it back on my skin. and i can feel every thread and fiber of my quilt, and my mom couldn't sleep as well. i might have to smoke a cigarette in a while
NotSignal	I just want it to be morning. I'm not mentally ready to deal with sitting here all night. No amount of Netflix can make this not sleeping okay.
NotSignal	I take 150 mg of diphenhydramine HCL and I was wondering how much doxylamine I should take since I got the wrong kind
NotSignal	So my situation is strange. I can sleep but wake up feeling unrested. Went to my psychiatrist and he changed my meds. Said if that didn’t help he would refer me to do a sleep study. Guess when you show them just how much this shit affects you, it gets taken seriously.
NotSignal	I got about five hours of sleep before waking up. My body got hot, kinda spasmy, and I kept farting, though the gas isn't a common symptom. The other two strike seemingly at random and I don't know what to do. I couldn't get comfortable, and at some point started to sweat, and I had to go shower. I don't know why I feel so heavy and tired, yet so restless. I hate when this happens because it highlights how I definitely don't fare better in less sleep and definitely need more. There was so much I wanted to accomplish today before a night of fun, but now I don't know if I can handle even basic tasks. Does this happen to anyone else? What's wrong with me?
Signal	Hi, 26F here who has suffered from insomnia for about 6 years. I got my sleep mostly under control when I started taking trazodone to sleep. However, on nights where I drank alcohol, my sleep quality was a lot worse. 4+ drinks in an evening and it would take me 4-5 hours to fall asleep. Having less than that was kind of a grab bag - sometimes I slept fine, sometimes took hours to fall asleep. Usually 1-2 was fine, though. However, the past few times I've had just one drink (beer or glass of wine) in the evening I've had insomnia. Has anyone else experienced this, or have any suggestions on what the cause/solution may be? Possibly relevant sleep hygiene info: I go to sleep and wake up around the same time every day, I don't drink caffeine past noon, I work out for an hour around 6 days a week (yoga or biking), don't use screens for an hour before bed, read/meditate before sleeping, don't use my bed for anything other than sleep. I take 100 mg of trazodone and 6mg melatonin every night. Besides the insomnia, I'm in excellent health.
Signal	Went through a very long bout of sleeplessness and it was really starting to fuck me up. I just had my first night of more than five hours the other day and now I feel like I'm chasing it. Trying to do everything the same, watching the same stuff, ate the same food, but here I am just angry and awake. Why am I like this god I hate insomnia so much
NotSignal	This has been going on for a few months now and I'm starting to lose my shit. I'll go from sleeping to wide awake out of nowhere and will get sleepy again around 5 AM, which is an hour before my alarm goes off. I suffer from migraines and this has been a major trigger for them. I've been trying to just stay awake lately and go shower or have coffee, but no matter what I'm always sleepy again a couple of hours later. I only drink coffee once a day when I wake up and don't really drink soda or anything else caffeinated. I don't eat dinner late- usually at 6 PM and I go to bed between 10 PM and midnight. Looking for advice so that I can get back to feeling human and not so damn grouchy all the time.
Signal	First of all i am sorry for any mistakes on sintax or mispelled words, my first language is not english. I do not usually seek help on the internet, sorry once again.So, i have been lurking on reddit for about 2 years now and i found this subreddit today, i am only 19 years old and have insomnia. I cannot go see a doctor so i am seeking help here. My symptoms are: - I usually fall asleep in like 1 to 2 hours from lying in bed doing nothing, literally just focusing on clearing my mind and shit, but it doesn't work. This one happend since i can recall, i always had trouble falling asleep.- I wake up from any noise no matter how small, tried earbuds, they help to an extent.- I go to sleep at 22:30 usually, fall asleep at like midnight and i have my alarm for 7:00 the next day. Well, usually i wake up at around 5 and cannot go back to sleep.- I am tired the whole day as a result. Even on weekends when i try to sleep during the day to recover some energy, i can not for the life of me fall asleep and if by some miracle i manage to fall asleep, i am waken up my some thing, any thing.And just to clarify i do not drink coffee. I have tried meditation and drugs. I will try to answer any questions.. sorry for wasting your time with my fucking problems but i had enough. I really need some help that i cant get irl right now.
NotSignal	Almost forgot what sleep is. Started losing track of the days a few weeks ago. Have to look at my phone so I'll know. In and out of sleep like reruns of an old show, you know what's about to happen, you watch anyway. I keep remembering people, things, stuff...but I think they're gone now and someone else took their place. I'm coherent, I know what's going on around me...but I just can't seem to interact properly. There's a disconnection between the world and me. On the outside I'm fine...on the inside I'm gone. I hope Somnus finds me before too long. I don't know how much longer I can deal with people in this state. I don't know how much longer I can deal with myself...
Signal	Monday night I had panic attacks all night long so I never fell asleep. Was told by my boss being tired isn't an excuse to call out of work so i worked an 11 hour day on no sleep. That night (Tuesday) and slept from 9pm till midnight and then never fell back asleep. Last night (Wednesday) i slept from midnight till about 4, giving me a grand total of 7 hours of sleep in 3 days. And on all of these nights, i took my sleep meds at the same time as always, they just never worked. 'm emotional and exhausted and so mentally drained and i don't know how I'm going to survive another work day.
Signal	I just started taking 7.5 mg for insomnia, but I’m hoping it’ll get a bit of anxiety and depression relief as well. I’ve been sleeping decently, the first time in a while that I’ve slept 7+ hours for multiple nights. I’ve been having pretty bizarre and vivid dreams though, and just feeling a bit hazy during the first half of my day.. luckily, haven’t experienced much effect on my appetite. What have people’s experiences been like with this drug? Do the dreams subside or calm down a bit? Did the hazy daytime feeling subside ? Any mood enhancement at this dosage? Since I struggle with insomnia, anxiety, and depression, I’m really hoping this drug will help with all 3 issues. Plus, as an athletic, healthy person, I’m not too concerned about the weight factor. Thanks! And please keep it positive.. I’m hoping to hear some success stories, I’ve already read enough bad reviews of this drug online to scare myself, but I want to give it an honest chance.
Signal	it’s 6 am and i’m writing this not because i’m still awake from the night before, but because i JUST WOKE UP! unspeakable. my sis is prescribed to xanax and offered me some to see if it would help with sleep. i took 1mg (maybe that was too much? not really sure) at 10 pm and an hour later i was asleep. now i’m awake. i got 7 hours of sleep! usually, and especially during quarantine because i have no schedule, i’ve been almost completely nocturnal. then i sleep for like 12 hours. maybe it’s a fluke but i’m going to try again tonight, maybe lower the dosage, and hopefully have another night of normal sleep again!!! i’m excited. have any of you tried this and has it worked for you?
Signal	Really upset that I’m fighting off what I’m pretty sure is covid-19 and I’ve been trying to fall asleep for 7 hours now tried falling asleep at 5am it’s currently 11:50 am, I think I’m dealing with my anxiety secretly, I’m thinking maybe I’m more scared of this virus than I think because every time I almost slip into sleep I jump up as if I was scared to fall asleep, unfortunately no one can come into my room to help me fall asleep by due to me not wanting anyone else to get sick. Also been getting random senses that I have like pent up energy or something but then once I feel like maybe I should do something about it I get tired and it becomes a cycle, it’s been very aggravating so I think I’ll try to do something in my room without exerting myself that way I can maybe get rid of that pent up energy? I just want to sleep so I can heal properly:( I’m also gonna eat some oatmeal
NotSignal	Laying in bed is agonizing. I feel I’ve gone down every rabbit hole of entertainment because I’ve been out of school in quarantine life for like over a year. Send entertainment please my sanity is begging
Signal	I’m in class Monday morning at 8am so it’s important I figure out this asap. I can’t sleep. At all. Not even 50mg of Benadryl helps me sleep. I have to take over 100mg to be able to fall asleep and I’m lucky if I can stay asleep. Last night I laid down at midnight, planning to wake up at 8:30 for church. Closed my eyes, had all of my lights off, had my sleep sounds on. I’m relaxing and then have to pee, so I open my eyes and turn towards my phone to pause the sleep sounds just to see that it was 2:30am and I hadn’t gotten a single blink of sleep. I ended up falling asleep (I think) but woke up around 4:30, 5:30, and 7. Once 7 came, I gave up on sleep and just laid in bed until I had to get up. I usually don’t have this issue. I’m not in a new environment, I’m not sleeping in a new bed with new sheets. They’re clean but using the same detergent and such I always use. The temperature in my room is 65F (said to be the perfect temperature for sleeping). What else can I do??? I have to wake up at 7am tomorrow to be able to get dressed and get breakfast before my 8am class, which lasts 4 hours! I have heart problems so I can’t have coffee/energy drinks and salty snacks are frowned upon. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke anything, the only “drug” I use is the Benadryl (when I can afford it) to help me fall asleep!
Signal	Started finding it harder and harder to fall asleep, normally start laying as if sleeping at about 1:30am but not sure when I actually get to sleep if at all, is this some sort of early stage insomnia or is it just standard sleep problems. It's not just a delayed sleep cycle as I still have no problems waking up early for school but I still can't sleep. Have also been dealing with being very irritable and tired during the day but barely when actually trying to sleep.
Signal	I have insomnia for quite some time now. There are some good tips shared by people on here, so thanks for that. Especially preparing your brain for bed by slowly making it darker and avoiding laptops etc makes sense. Can't wait to try! Even though I don't sleep well I still have a pretty high energy level and I visit the gym about five times a week. Is this normal? I'd say from the 8 hours I'm in bed I sleep 4-5. I wake up several times during the night and early morning and then I also wake up with an erection . Doesn't this makes it even harder to fall asleep? (no pun intended). For me it does. I find it hard to believe men that have this problem tossing and turning in bed for 30min trying to fall asleep every time don't get annoyed by this. The solution may be easy but it's the same the next time I wake up and I don't want to be masturbating all night. I have done some research but it seems not many have this problem or don't feel comfortable to talk about it. The only thing I can find is that erectile dysfunction is more common among men with insomnia.What I also can't stand in bed is light. A sleep mask has helped me sleep better, it might help you too and they are cheaper than pills.And you know that feeling that in the middle of the night you wake up because your arm is going numb while sleeping because you're in a certain position? Do you still notice and wake up if you take sleeping pills? Are those pills not dangerous? Or unhealthy? Or addictive?
NotSignal	Hey! So I’m a late sleeper. I could be on a good sleeping routine for the whole week, but once Its Saturday, I’m usually out raving until the next day 6-7am. I end up waking up around 3 on Sunday. How the hell am I supposed to fall asleep at 11pm when I’ve done f-ck all all day and only been awake for a few hours?Do you have a technique that actually works? Besides going to bed in a cold pitch black room, closing your eyes and focusing on your breathing ? Because that doesn’t work for me. Even valium/Xanax won’t work in these situations sometimes lol... So yeah what’s your trick to fall asleep when you woke up late, but still have to get to bed at a descent time ?? Thaaaanks x
NotSignal	I’ve never know what it feels like right before you fall asleep. How do you know when you close to falling asleep? Does everyone forget their night of sleep the next day? All I normally remember is either not falling asleep at all or waking up not well rested knowing I was up until least 4.
Signal	I've been on it for 2 weeks now (prescribed) and it works most of the time but sometimes it doesn't work very well, it doesn't make me feel as sleepy as Seroquel (the one I was on before, changed it for Trazodone because of side effects) has anyone had good experiences with it? Does it take weeks to work properly? Maybe is because I'm currently at 100mg.
Signal	My pcp has prescribed me 50mg of quetiapine for sleep. I have struggled with GAD and depression since I was 19. I do have a therapist that I have been meeting with since and it has helped a lot however the last 6 months, due to increases stress, I have not been able to sleep. I tried EVERYTHING! I noticed that during the afternoon/evening hours is when I start to stress and my anxiety comes back.I started with 25 mg so far and it only knocked me out on the first night. It hasn’t done anything for me since. Maybe I should try taking two (50mg) instead? I plan on being asleep around 11 pm. What time should I take it? And should I take it on an empty stomach? I feel like I’m doing something wrong....
NotSignal	I know it's stupid, but I feel tensed up and my mind seems paranoid and won't let me sleep. I'm pretty mad at myself for watching that shit right before bed. Well, gonna be a sleepless night!
Signal	So I have really bad insomnia, had it for awhile now, I'm prescribed a high dose of trazodone and seroquel to take nightly to sleep. I'm 18 and have come across a good thing about having it, only for some tho. Basically what it is, is that I literally never pass out, when I'm drinking with my friends doing drugs, or smoking heavily, I never pass out no matter how faded I am, no matter how much alcohol I drank or drugs I did. It's rather awesome, I'm also not a small person by any means for my age, so that kinda makes me able to handle more of whatever I'm doing than my peers. I have tested this theory many times by pushing whatever I'm doing to the extreame, high amounts of xanax, 25+ plus shots of tequla. Tons of codein, pills, you name it. Every time i tested it I was able to stay awake super easily. Just thought I'd share a good thing about insomnia 🤷‍♀️
NotSignal	I dont mind crashing at 2 am but sometimes it turns into 6am and that cant happen anymore I have responsibilities like everyone else lol.
Signal	I take a bunch of different pills to sleep, I ran out of 1 of them, now I can't sleep again, great.&#x200B;I take \-Trazodone \-Diazepam\-Sycrest (asenapine) \-Lormetazepam\-Melatonin&#x200B;I ran out of Sycrest, wich is an anti-psychotic that basically stops you from thinking too much, missed that and now I can't sleep again.
NotSignal	Anyone else experience waking up every two to three hours. I don’t have a problem falling asleep or going back to sleep.
NotSignal	I have 3 days only getting 20mns of sleep every night... I'm getting this horrible dream where I'm in a car accident with all of my family members and everyone dies tragically, and I'm the only one alive... I see pools of blood around the highway scattered and I immediately wake up... I'm too scared to go to sleep but also I'm tiredIdk what to do, I just want to sleep and rest
Signal	So about a month ago, there was a final for my last Biology exam and I was kinda stressed about it the night before. I decided to go to sleep like an hour before more normal bedtime. Bad Idea. I couldn't sleep until it was like 4 am and I had to wake at 6. Welp, throughout the day, I feel like on the verge of passing out and that really messed me up (I did pass the exam though) and from that day on, I couldn't get a single good night of sleep, usually takes me a few hours. I've also never had insomnia before, maybe just a few bad nights. So a month of winter break and classes start tomorrow again and I don't think I'll be able to make it through the week. Insomnia got me so stressed and I read that Insomnia can cause heart problems, which I think I might be getting soon. I am constantly stressed about my heart and I think my heart is being weird, but I'm not sure if that's just me being paranoid or not. I feel like death is near. Any tips? (I know there are sleeping pills and stuff but does anyone have other things that personally works for you? Thanks all!)
Signal	It's been three days, I have slept two hours in these, I'm desperate, I have had insomnia for years but medication was helping a lot, I'm currently on trazadone, it made me sleep like a log for two days and now I cant sleep at all, and my mom is disabled so I need to be around to help her so even though I sleep better during the day I can't. I have other health issues, if those are relevant, but I would try just about anything now
NotSignal	I've been sleeping at a relatively normal time and sleeping for 7-9 hours but just feel tired af all the time and don't have much energy to do stuff. I feel really tired in the morning and struggle to not give in to going back to bed, tired during the day and am ready to fall asleep at like 5pm but have to stay awake so I don't wake up at like 2-3am or sometimes earlier like 10pm. I thought my body would readjust after several days but it doesn't seem like it will
Signal	Does anyone else drink a lot of soda? Even caffeine free like diet Sprite. I used to struggle a ton with insomnia when I was a pop drinker and then I switched to seltzer and my troubles went away. I went back to pop because I love it and here I am, up at 1:45 a.m. I know it sounds stupid but I'm still not convinced that it is the soda giving me the sleeping problems. Any help, advice or relatable content would be greatly appreciated. I'll be up
Signal	Not even getting a whole week's worth of sleep is fixing the psychological damage I went through last week. The burning, the pain, the mood swings, the panic, my dad holding me tight while I broke down.. I am hoping to become myself again soon, but the tears just won't stop falling. I feel like I'll never go back to being me again. I feel like my vision is never going to be the same. I feel like I can never view the world the same ever again. Those three days awake.. the absolute insanity I went through. Dissociation, hallucinations, delusions, I had it all. Knowing I currently have a condition (hyperthyroidism) that caused it all doesn't help. The doctors won't even give me the medication for it. I'm stuck in a damn fix right now.
NotSignal	At some time in April, I broke the world record for time spent without sleep. The previous record was 11 days and 25 minutes but I beat that by not sleeping for 11 days and around 16 hours. However, I couldn’t get it recorded as it wasn’t my aim to beat the record at first and my parents used to get mad at me when I didn’t sleep. At first, it started off with me just not being tired and I was okay for the first six days. I only got a bit tired during the days and constantly felt like I needed to run around the world. After around a week, my body finally started to ache and burn. That usually happened when I didn’t sleep. I also started to have minor hallucinations and my brain worked so slowly. It went like that until day 11. Beating the record made me feel so proud. I was upset that it wouldn’t have been recorded so there’s no actual proof I did it. Believe me, I did. It’s really taken a toll on my body as now I feel less intelligent due to my slower brain, I’m tired all the time and sleep for 13 hours (approximately) daily. My old sleeping schedule used to be 8am-5pm which has now changed to whenever I fall asleep (usually 4am-7am) to 2pm-5pm. I am 13 and autistic with not enough melatonin in my brain. My body aches constantly and my skin always feels like it’s burning because of it. My eyes are always heavy and I can never go to sleep before midnight. I had to pretend to be asleep and not tell my parents what I was doing so they wouldn’t know I stayed awake for so long. It’s sad that they’ll never know what I achieved. I don’t recommend trying to beat my record; your body will hurt all the time and feel like it has bruises on its limbs and your head will pound forever. I stayed awake for the 11 days months ago and I still feel sick and moving is painful sort of. Maybe tonight I’ll try sleeping at 10. My phone is the reason I stayed awake for those 11 days so I should probably turn it off at an early time tonight.
Signal	One of my family member is a doctor, and i’ve talked to her about my (new) irrational fear of not sleeping during the night. I told her what was going on in my head and what meds i’ve been taking in order to help me overcome my fear which is caused by my GAD. She told me, until i see my doctor, to - Take a pill of melathonin an hour before going to sleep.- Try to do some relaxation exercises to ease my mind- Take a pill of zopiclone only if I can’t sleep after midnight. It’s going to be two days that I’ve been taking melathonin an hour before going to bed (9pm). When i’m going to bed, i’m doing breathing exercises as well as meditation to calm my anxiety. I think (i’m not sure) that i’m sleeping through a very light sleep for I don’t know how much time (hence why I don’t feel like i’ve slept at all) until midnight. I can’t fall asleep again. I toss and turn, try to do some breathing exercises...Tonight, at almost 1am I gave up (again) and took a zopiclone to fall asleep. I woke up to my alarm this morning at 6am. Now, i’m wondering if the fact that i’m constantly waking up at midnight is my brain developping an addiction to zopiclone or the fact that my family member told me to only take zopiclone after midnight and Im so scared of not sleeping, that I unconsciously always wake up at that time to make sure a get a pill that will for sure make me sleep? (I don’t know if it is clear enough...?) I absolutely don’t want to become addicted. I just want my normal sleep schedule back. Should I stop using zopiclone tonight and try to only sleep wtih melathonin?
Signal	The past 3 year's I had severese sleeping issues in my life. Tried around 8 diffrent sleep medications from doctors and still never get a full 7+ hours of sleep. The only time I actually get a good nights sleep is if I eat Valium. And that's not really sustainable. But still, the past 3 years I always took some medication to fall asleep, I have lost the ability to take a nap during the day even if i been awake 48 hours. My sleep is "decent" right now. I can fall asleep during the evening with very minor sleep medication (I've been tapering down the past 1-2 months). However.. I ALWAYS wake up after around 2-5 hours of sleep and I can NEVER (well, 90% of the time) fall back asleep and it's driving my crazy since I only get 2-3 hours of sleep some nights each week. Does anybody have any tips on how I can fall back asleep during the night? I'm well aware of good sleep hygiene and I do all the normal recommendations that doctors and people say.. My own theory is that my mind has gotten so used to having a little bit of help to fall asleep during these past 3 years... So that when I wake up during the night I have less medication in my system and therfor can't fall back alseep? And maybe thats also why I cant take naps anymore? Could this be true? Any insight?
NotSignal	I've used Phenergan (Promethazine) which worked perfectly but I think I've become more tolerant to that stuff. My problem is staying asleep and Phenergan has done that well, are there any other anthistamines that work just as well? Also if my body becomes tolerant to one antihistamine, does that mean it has become tolerant to other antihistamines too? Thanks.
NotSignal	its 4:27 am and i am so close to giving and not sleeping at all for the 3rd time this week . any tips? what were your worst insomnia moments? how did you fix them? how do you reset your biological clock with pulling an all nighter?
Signal	I feel like I'm 1/4 asleep 3/4 awake, then I "wake up" feeling even more tired fuck my life
NotSignal	...and now I haven't been able to sleep at all the night after that.The fuck.It's like my body has stopped needing as much sleep as in the past, although I guess that's pretty unlikely. I laid down in the bed for maybe 9 hours straight, simply not being able to sleep because I wasn't even tired in the first place. Now it's almost 7am and sure now I'm starting to feel tired, but I still can't really fall asleep. Typical.
Signal	I started a new job months ago and had horrible insomnia. I would wake up every night at 2 am even after taking a melatonin and two strong drugstore sleeping meds (doxylamine succinate). I went to a psychiatrist about a separate issue and she prescribed trazadone to me. It was a huuuge lifesaver and I wish I did it before because it probably could have saved me previous jobs. If one pill doesn’t work for you you can always up the dosage or try other meds.Just wanted to put this out there because I wish someone told me this! I know there are also people out there who medications don’t work or cause them to oversleep.
Signal	I’m so tired of this bs. I’ve been struggling with insomnia on and off for about 4 years and I am seriously losing hope on getting better. I’m going insane. I don’t know what happiness feels like anymore. Everyday is hell. I’m so sleep deprived and depressed and I lack motivation to do anything. I’m a college student and insomnia has fucked up my entire college experience that I’m about ready to give up and drop out. My grades suck and I’ve missed out on so many opportunities. I recently started working part time because I thought getting out of the house and interacting with people would help, but it’s made my situation worse. I go into work with only 3 hours of sleep most days and I try to be patient but I swear some day my body is going to give up on me. Even if I’m exhausted from working all day, it still takes me hours and hours to fall asleep. There’s no way I can get a job real job and support myself given my situation. Insomnia has taken over my life. I’ve tried everything but it seems like I can only find temporary solutions. I can do everything right and establish a normal sleep schedule for the most part but that only lasts for about a few weeks before my sleep is fucked again. I’m going crazy. Im aware that I become irrational when I’m sleep deprived but I genuinely think the only way to put an end to my insomnia and depression is to end my life. I’m sorry for the rant but it’s 6am rn, I have to be at work in 3 hours, I’m bawling my eyes out and idk what to do anymore
Signal	So, I finally saw a doctor after 1: hallucinating and 2: losing a job, both due to severe extended sleep deprivation. Got me a psych consult in a week, a followup in six weeks, bloodwork cooking in the lab, and a trazodone script. I've been reading around, and it appears trazodone isn't considered habit-forming, but does come with withdrawal symptoms. What I'm wondering is, what is a safe spacing of doses and period of use to avoid withdrawals? If it truly helps with my insomnia and associated depression/anxiety(getting worse lately... not sure anymore if the insomnia is causing the depression or vice versa), then I'm okay with being on it for an extended period. But, while I'm still testing and getting things adjusted and seeing specialists, I don't want to end up in a shitty withdrawal situation in three weeks. &#x200B;So, what are y'all's experiences? Use duration+dose+withdrawal symptoms/duration of withdrawal symptoms. Thanks!
NotSignal	I’m an 18 year old male. I am not technically diagnosed with insomnia, but I have had trouble sleeping for a long time. My only diagnosed things are aspergers and ADHD. I don’t take any drugs, just usually a vitamin D pill before bed due to a blood test a few years back showing a deficiency. I have had emotional issues for a good bit now. It’s like I’ve just been on a decline for years. I’m very lonely and worry about college coming this fall. You may be wondering how this interferes with my sleep. Well, these thoughts often just linger on in my head for quite some time after I go to bed. I end up all waking up often long before my desired time to wake up and can’t fall back asleep even though I’m still lacking sleep. I also struggle to even get to bed on time. I often catch myself staying up way too late doing whatever and I still can’t sleep and get these thoughts in my head that make me look at my phone. I know I have horrible sleep habits, but I don’t know what to do. I feel it’s only getting worse. I’ve been crying myself to sleep the past few nights and am waking up very unrested. I ended up so tired at one point yesterday that I started to get lightheaded. Is there anything I can do or am I just being stupid to ask for help?
NotSignal	I hope someone else can relate to this so I know I’m not going crazy. Every night for the past couple weeks, I’ve had an increasingly intense experience as I start to lose consciousness. It always starts as hearing noises outside my house that wake me up, and then I start to hear this rythmic pulsing vibration, I guess? (For those asking: it’s not tinnitus). It is terrifying, it never speeds up, just gets louder. It makes it impossible to go to sleep because i am scared. It sounds like marching, but it’s entirely a vibration, not a noise or sound. Does anyone have this or think they can help?If it matters, I’m not stressed or anxious, eat well, and I exercise daily.
Signal	I had tried ambien once and actually got sleep. I asked my doctor for it and she said that since I have the most trouble staying asleep I should try Lunesta because it’s similar. Well I took it and now I’m wide awake again. Got my normal 3 hours yesterday but was groggy as hell. And everything tasted like quarters. Totally not worth it and nothing like ambien
Signal	I've been experimenting with melatonin to see if it would help stabilize my sleep schedule, as at this point I'm practically nocturnal. My parents have bottles of 5 mg pills of melatonin, so I took 30 mg. Some sources online say it'll knock me out, others say it makes it worse now. This is the highest dosage I've ever taken, but 15 mg the other day seemed to be useless.
NotSignal	Second night without sleep. God why is this happening to me? All I want is to just sleep like everybody else. Laying in bed is such a stressful thing. I can't relax at all when I go to sleep and keeps rolling on the bed, overthinking. It is 6 AM now.
NotSignal	I just lay here and wait for the vicious cycle to end. I can’t just stop drinking water, my dry throat won’t let me.
NotSignal	I havent had trouble with sleep at all since yesterday. I havent slept at all yesterday and tonight I just woke from a two and a half hour sleep but no matter how much I try, my brain refuses to go to sleep. I'm 16 years old please help me as I am new to this subreddit
Signal	just a rant.my insomnia has just been getting worse and worse by each week. It has consecutively gotten worse and continues to rapidly get worse. I used to be able to at-least pass out during the day for a few hours (never did much but it was something) but now, I only get an hour or 2 of sleep each day. I’ve tried pretty much every over the counter pills and even a prescribed pill for sleep- but my body utterly just rejects them all and never works. it’s getting to the point where i’m constantly just breaking down because i’m just so tired, and nobody is taking it seriously at all, no matter how many times i try and explain it. My father doesn’t believe in any “mental health issues” and pretends they don’t exists; for example i literally have to secretly take my Vyvanse for my adhd so he doesn’t find out and if he does there’s going to be an entire issue. but anyways- i’ve tried everything the doctor told me, and none of it worked. like i said, I am on vyvanse, but even when i went almost 2-3 weeks without it i still had such terrible insomnia. I’ve even started having auditory hallucinations, but when i tell them they don’t listen at all. i understand that my insomnia can (i think) link to my medication. but i don’t know what i’d do without the vyvanse if they tried to pause it again because then i’d also completely decline again academically and emotionally too. I want to say it’s linked to my medication but also not (?) idk because i think it’s just also me because around 7pm is when the meds are out of my system so when i try and sleep later without it in me it never comes, even when i try to go to sleep early. i honestly just don’t know what to do anymore, like i’m just lost at this point. All i want is to sleep.
Signal	I have been dealing with insomnia for a little over a month. Currently taking trazadone and having mixed results (half the time works half the time doesn’t). Not trying to become dependent on sleeping pills and wanted to know if anyone has tried CBT? I am currently in regular (I guess traditional) therapy and don’t know if it is helping. I heard great things about CBT but wasn’t sure if it was worth looking for a new therapist. (I’m new to the therapy world, and have only seen mine two times so far so I know I probably have to give it more of a shot). Let me know your thoughts/experience.
NotSignal	title. I'm 16, and it came on rather suddenly for no reason, and I've been battling it for a month now. the basic rundown is this; when I go to bed and I'm particularly sleepy, or if I have bad sleep habits, when falling asleep, a number of things happen. the most prominent (and worrying) are these:1. my sleep becomes *extremely* light (able to even be disturbed by the very fan/rain noise videos i usually listen to. the sleep anxieties also worsen this)2. Tetris Effect about falling asleep and my associated new anxieties about it (which makes me aware im falling asleep, causing me to force myself out of hypnagogia),and 3. a sudden pang of intense derealization and depersonalization that lasts for up to 10 seconds if i leave hypnagogia, sometimes making me move around as if my entire body has restless legs syndrome, just to alleviate it and try again. this loops on and on for upwards of 1-5 hours, maybe 30 minutes if I'm lucky, until I'm finally so exhausted that I fall asleep anyways. some nights I'll sleep through it just fine with no dreams, other nights I wake up and fall asleep over and over. things like hypnic jerks haven't become more or less rare. it's linked to sleep hygiene too. It receded entirely when I forced my schedule to 11 pm to 2 pm within half a week's time.
Signal	I have never consumed cannabis. I’m excited to take 20mg of indica THC tonight, as I heard they can be effective for sleep. Do any cannabis users remember what dose they tried, on their first time? I’m gonna split a 40mg gummy in half.
Signal	This is my third day with a small amount of sleep (~2 hours per 24). My body aches, and I feel ravenously hungry. I feel so angry and frustrated. And, as I sit here in my hoodie watching these stupid, godforsaken infomercials on the TV, I'm wishing that I knew how to box just so that I could just punch something really really hard. Repeatedly.This is the first time I've ever experienced anything like this. Is it common to have sudden bouts of insomnia? On the bright side, I guess I can go get breakfast at McDonald's now.
Signal	A couple months ago I got my biggest wave of continuous panic attacks that kept me awake for days (was my second one ever), since then I slept fine but I was pretty anxious all the time since quarantine I was basically locked to the same place where I had that episode, it finally happened last Wednesday when the same thing happened again at the same rate or even a bit stronger, after four days of no sleep and panic I was basically thinking about the worst case scenario that I was gonna have psychosis from sleep deprivation especially since I was in my room almost all the time and I couldn't really move or do much due to the loss of appetite so I started to get paranoid and I understandably started feeling a bit down but I'm not depressed.These last two days I'm almost baseline calm but still not over the insomnia which could increase my anxiety. I went to a psychiatrist for the first time today explained everything and gave me prescription of 5 mg of olanzapine every night and said don't worry even if its used to treat more severe disorders and that I should report back in a month.Since then I've read everything I can on off label use but I find mixed results, some people that swear by them and others they warn not to use them.The main side effects mentioned are weight gain which I don't mind since I lost 7 kg these last months due to anxiety so I'm moderately underweight and dullness which I'm not a fan of but if it's just short term treatment I don't mind it since I'm gonna be stuck home doing nothing anyways for the foreseeable future.Anyone has experience with the off label use? Is the dosage too much?PS: first time was last year for half a day got calmed quick when visiting ER and gave me Valium that I used for a couple of days, it happened in an unfamiliar space and was drug induced so I recovered from it without a problem.
Signal	So a few weeks ago I got really drunk. Like excessively drunk . I had something like 10 beers, each between 6% and 7% alcohol. The drinking had steadily been becoming a problem over the last 3 years and because of the increased alcohol tolerance it now took alot to get me really drunk. One of the side effects of drinking that developed over those 3 years was the inability to sleep after a binge. I would get drunk and not sleep that night and be tired all day but the next night I would get myself back to regular sleep. The problem started on that last day that I drank on a Friday. I didn't not sleep that night at all but then slept like super hard the next night on Saturday so I thought everything was fine. Then on Sunday I was completely unable to sleep but slept fine the following night on Monday. This weird pattern of sleeping one night and not the next repeated till Wednesday that week and then I couldn't fall asleep for 3 nights in a row. No matter how tired I was my body just would not let me sleep. From that point on I've only been able to get a max of 4 hours of sleep on good night's and it's been hell. I've been taking melatonin and it helps me get some sleep, usually around two hours but I still feel miserable. I now also have anxiety about going to bed because I know how likely but it is that I'll just toss and turn all night. I just wish I knew what the heck is wrong with me. Did I cause myself brain damage from too much alcohol and will now have a permanent sleeping problem? Did I damage my liver or give myself some other condition which is making it impossible for me to sleep? Sometimes I feel like this may be it, like I'm dying a very slow, progressively agonizing death. I hope I'm wrong. I've seen a doctor but it hasn't been helpful, they are prescribing me some sleeping pills and running some labs. I hope that this is just stress from the new Covid environment and that I can get myself back on a normal sleep schedule. If anyone has had any experience like this one I would love to read about it. Reading all the posts on r/insomnia makes me feel like part of a community and it's nice to know I'm not alone.
NotSignal	My sleep pattern has been like this for about a week now(probably a little more but idk)And i am basically not allowed to sleep because if i do, my sleep pattern will stay the same for quite a while so my choices are go to sleep at a reasonable time(not gunna happening as you can probably tell) or not sleep one night so i can sleep the nextIm in the stage of trying not to fall asleep right now(Kinda just wanted to vent a little)
NotSignal	I'm actually tired for once! Hopefully I can keep this up and not ease my way back to 6AM, but only time will tell. Good luck tonight, r/insomnia
Signal	hello this b my first time posting on reddit or anything so hi hello but anyways i’ve always had issues sleeping because I take ADD/ADHD meds which are stimulants but i find it especially hard in the heat. i’ve been prescribed trazodone for my sleep issues but when i take it i wake up with a crippling migraine and then can sleep the next night because of it. for that reason i tend to stay away from taking it unless the situation is really bad and i’ve been up for three days or more. do you guys have any tips on how to sleep in the heat? i’ve tried ice packs and fans and laying on top of the blanket and everything and i’m just at a loss right now.
Signal	I took 3.5mg of zopiclone at 3am hoping to fall asleep by 4 and wake up around noon... but it’s 7am and I’m still awake. This was my second time taking it, the first being over a year ago for jet lag and it worked fine then, so I don’t think this is a tolerance issue.Anyways it has side effects including sleep walking and you can’t drive for a while after taking it and memory loss etc, but it’s 7am now and I haven’t slept and can’t because I have things to do around 1pm and if I fall asleep now I’ll probably be out until 5pm. But I’m worried about what it’s like to be awake after taking this and not sleeping at all?? Should I cancel my plans and sleep the day away or stay awake and be completely out of it the whole day... (wasn’t planning on driving anyways but I don’t wanna be clumsy forgetful exhausted zombie regardless)This insomnia stuff sucks so bad man. I thought I was going to get a good sleep for once. Now my day is ruined either way. I feel so fucking defeated. Everyone says to get help but doesn’t tell you what to do when the help doesn’t fucking help
Signal	I know this seems like an odd place to call myself an addict, but I need help. I have been an insomniac since I was little. My parents gave me melatonin, then melatonin + Benadryl, then melatonin + Benadryl + valerian root, etc and so on until I hit 18 and my doctor prescribed me Ambien 10 mg. It is the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me. The problem came when I had the Gastric Sleeve. Suddenly I wasn't just using Ambien to sleep. It became a need and 10 mg wasn't enough. I talked my bf into getting a 10 mg script and I started to take 20 mg a night. That was fine until I found out last December that my doctor will not prescribe Ambien anymore until I have tried other things. I've tried trazodone (got bad migraines), doxepin (gave me almost seizure like jerks), amitriptyline (migraine again), lunesta (starting vomiting an hour after taking it), Klonopin (does absolutely nothing), Xanax (once again... Nothing), nortriptyline (migraines), hydroxyzine (does nothing), weed (I get severely paranoid and have crying fits) and a combination of the above mentioned. During this time, my bf has been getting his Ambien and only giving it to me when I just can't take anymore lack of sleep 1-2 x a week. He found out today that his doctor will not prescribe anything else until he tries other avenues. Do you guys have any recommendations for getting myself off of Ambien? Anything else to fall asleep?
Signal	I’d like to stop taking but I’m scared of the 3-4 nights of rebound insomnia. My Dr is going to stop the gravy train. Is there anything else he would be more open to prescribing that would help? I take all the otc’s, diphenhydramine, doxylamin, magnesium glycinate, passionflower, skull cap, l tryptophan, 5htp+b6, lions mane, etc. I’m 40m, healthy, good job, wife, kids, etc My trouble is falling asleep. I’ve heard about trazadone, mitzapine (AP), but I don’t have experience with them. I get up at the exact same time every morning. Anybody else have secrets or tips to help me fall asleep quicker.
NotSignal	Things I’m going to do to combat insomnia. I’m not a professional but these are the things I’m gonna do behaviorally. -not read the news before going to bed. too much stimulus -wear socks bc I can’t sleep if my feet are cold -exercise at night til I’m fucking exhausted -eat healthy -read instead of browsing or streaming before I go to bed -if reading gets tough (I have adhd) I’ll listen to soothing piano covers of songs -thought insertion if my thoughts begin to spiral-if I can’t sleep, completely remove myself from bed. Walk around. Read. Then go back. No phone. -cut out nicotine This better work. I’m running on fumes.
Signal	It's 5:56 and I just cannot sleep. I just want to cry.
NotSignal	I always sleep at like 00:00 then I get up around 03:00 To drink some water then for god sake I cannot sleep again, like now currently is 4:22 what can I do to repair my sleep, I tried to stay awake all day but is impossible, since I’m in quarantine I cannot get out of the house.I remember one day I think it was a week ago, I finished a whole game just in one day and I went to sleep at 7:00 then I woke up at 14:00 so since then I’m not getting good sleep, I need help please, I’m 18 and sorry for my bag English.
Signal	Basically, 1.5 hours of sleep is my daily amount. Its equivalent to 5 hours, so with this im able to function. (Not the best, but i CANNOT fall asleep again till night if im lucky.) i have tried almost everything i can think of from meditation to medication. 1.5 hours is what i usually get after two days. Two days of gaming, forcing myself to go to the gym (really bad idea but i was desperate) and staying up for the rest of the day without naps in fear of not being able to sleep at night ONLY to continue being unable to fall asleep that sane night. And it HURTS. Like do i stay up or take naps? 1.5 hours of nap and BOOM 2 nights with no sleep.
Signal	I've always had trouble sleeping since i was a kid, can't remember the last time I stringed together a whole week of 7 hours of sleep nights.I also had one period of like six months where I would stay up for days at a time.
Signal	Every night I take 1600 mg of gabapentin and 4 mg of klonopin, and I still wake up in the middle of the night wide awake only to crash halfway through the day. My max dosage is 2400 mg of gabapentin and 4 mg of klonopin. I’ve gone all the way to those levels and I still wake up. I just want to be able to sleep. Does this happen to anyone else?
NotSignal	I can’t get any sleep at night because I keep beating myself up about everything I did wrong today even though it wasn’t that bad

Signal	Lost cause here. Insomniac since forever. The only treatment that's ever worked for me is mirtazapine, which is like a sleep aid/appetite accelerant/antidepressant. I hate the way antidepressants completely make me numb and emotionless, so I'd like to avoid them and deal with my shit head on. But I just can't get to sleep, and struggle insanely hard to wake up. no matter how many hours I get. I was wondering if I stayed up for 2 days (with the use of modafinil and armodafinil) and took an extended sleep afterwards (like 12-14 hours), would that be an okay plan? body wouldn't cave in or anything? just a dumbass looking to make my insomina bearable without resorting to treatment that makes me a perpetual space cadet. I just really can't sleep, and when I do, I really can't wake up. help me wise insominac wizards
NotSignal	They only come at night and constantly wanna have a stare off. I cant wait for my next Víctor device to electricute the shit out of these motherfuckers.
Signal	I’ve seen a lot of useful tips for how to fall asleep quickly and most can be beneficial. However I have a question which is as widely discussed. For the past week I have woken up several times during the night (dripping in sweat though I believe this is because I’m cold turkeying weed).After I normally struggle but do ultimately get back to sleep. Due to the constant waking up I’m not reaching my REM cycle of sleep and therefore feel tired even after extended periods of sleep. I’ve spoken to my sister who’s a GP but all she could recommend was to concentrate on improving my mental health. Does anyone have any tips regarding this issue? Would be much appreciated.Relevant info:(I’m not having nightmares)
Signal	Every night it’s like this.... 10 pm... 11... 12 am... 1... then around 2 or 3 am, I will get a little sleepy. Then fall asleep just to pop up at 5 am, in order to start the day. I am tired. 2 or 3 hours is just not enough. I walk through the days like a zombie... going through the motions and grunting at whoever tries to speak to me.
NotSignal	I’m lucky enough to know what causes my insomnia. I work a rotating shift schedule, 2 overnights and 2 afternoon shifts, with only a 24 hour window to switch in between. That 24 hours has gone well maybe 3 times in my 2 years at this job. The schedule means that I sleep at a different time every day. It’s been a nightmare. One bad sleep day ruins a whole week. Buuuut I’m starting a regular, WFH 9-5 next month! I am so pumped, but also really scared. I’m hoping that this means I’ll be able to sleep 11-7 every night line a normal person. But I’m also really worried that I’ve permanently damaged my circadian rhythms and that I’ll never be able to get my sleep under control.
Signal	I’ve been struggling with insomnia my whole life, seems like it only gets worse as I get older. Ever since I was a small child I’ve had an issue getting to sleep. I’m 23 now, and I’m lucky to even get 2-3 hours. I’m never tired at night. Like right now. It’s 3:26am, and I’m wide awake. I’ve tried everything. Nothing knocks me out anymore. I feel so hopeless. But during the day, I’m so, so tired. I hate living like this. :(
Signal	Would very much appreciate some feedback here. I started with sleep onset insomnia, for which melatonin (3mg nightly) helped quite a bit. But...I think I broke myself with daily melatonin use (3mg) for over two years. Finally stopping, but now my body is unable to sleep on its own more than 6 hours total. Whether it’s 6 in one go, or 5 then awake for awhile then another 1 hour, always 6. Not sure if anyone has found the same with melatonin or know if this could be a side effect of long term usage? Maybe my body just demands exogenous melatonin now and has been trained to produce less itself?
Signal	Alright idk what the heck is going on with me but here we go. I’m only 17 and have alright health besides some derealisation and anxiety. A month ago I was diagnosed with anemia/low iron and a few weeks after that I pulled an all nighter with my friends. After that all nighter my body was at an all time low for 4 days. Everyday felt like I was on some heavy drugs or something. Eventually it passed and everything was normal for a few weeks, but lately I’ve been feeling extremely tired and have developed a bit of insomnia. Usually can’t sleep til around 1-4 am and I sleep either 4 hours or 12 - never a normal 8-9. Can’t see a doctor til Monday and it’s currently 1 am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning. Not getting proper sleep makes me feel so shitty even if it’s just by a few hours. Oils this be because sleep deprivation mixed with anemia is just a recipe for disaster or is the anemia causing the insomnia?
NotSignal	I came I saw and I tried to conquer, but then I realised I couldn't do shit 'cause I've been fucking crippled.
Signal	I'm a second semester senior in college and even during the Covid quarantine, which has made my insomnia practically uncontrollable, where I was kicked off campus at a moments notice, had to pack, ship, or throw away all my belongings (because I'd already effectively moved out and lived permanently in my dorm) in only three days time, some of my professors still have zero sympathy for me. You aren't alone in it being completely misunderstood.People who haven't experienced it assume that a bad night's sleep is synonymous with insomnia, because again, they have never experienced chronic insomnia, and it doesn't help that modern culture loves to brag about the Pain Olympics, so everybody thinks they're an insomniac just because they "stayed up for TWO DAYS bro just to write ONE paper I NEVER sleep dude". I have been guaranteed to fail at least one of the only three classes I'm in, I recently had a professor tell me that even though the school mandated pass/fail as an option because of the quarantine and even though many professors have outright *guaranteed* they won't fail anyone given the obviously difficult circumstances that have been created, they are going to fail me if I don't turn in the final, regardless of all the work I've already done for the class.And for those of you who might think "of course you should be failed for not finishing the final", you need to reflect on how much power a school has over a young persons life and what the ridiculous definition of 'educated' is in 2020, or at least enough so to get that piece of paper to stick on your wall. I have put five years into that school, never failed a class in all that time, only ever received two C's, and the reason I couldn't finish in four years is because I had to take medical leave at one point due to my insomnia. I have seen kids drop classes to have Friday off for parties, take 2 courses a semester because they were too busy with sports, get suspended for failing too many classes, get booted from their major for cheating on exams, met kids who paid for all of their papers to be written for them, I've even had kids offer *me* upwards of $250 to write a single paper for them (which I didn't, not that I could have anyway, I had enough trouble writing my own without any sleep). Yet still, because of a condition I have zero control over and because some of my professors don't want to take the time to understand genuine insomnia, I'm going to fail. One class minimum so far, I've been guaranteed to fail. And no, I'm not going to be able to finish that final. It's a large presentation requiring research and reading that I can't do when I haven't slept for more than 4 hours a night consistently over the last two weeks, and if you also have insomnia, real, genuine, insomnia then I have a feeling you'll understand that inability. This became a wild long rant. Woops. But, moral of the story is, your insomnia is real, regardless of whether anyone believes you, and it isn't your fault for having it, regardless of whether people tell you it is because you "hAVenT eVen tRieD mELaToNin". I believe you, a lot of people on here believe you, we know you're doing your best, and to those who don't, well, in the words of Marcus Aurelius, a man I read extensively about in the schooling people accuse me of slacking during because they don't understand insomnia, "It's quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it. Remember that."
NotSignal	I work nights, and these last 2 years I've been exercising a lot.I'm 47, I've lost 35lb and certainly toned up, but nowhere near as much as I would of done, had I been getting 8 hours sleep everyday. I've had 2 hours sleep today, but I'm awake now and hoping I can muster the energy to do a workout. I'm counting on, after walking the dog to have another 2 hours sleep time permitting, before I have to set off for work again. Does anybody else take the gym seriously, and get by on as little as 4 hours sleep a day/night?What kind of gains do you see?What motivates you to stick it out?Thanks.
Signal	Hi, I had for a few months sleeping problems, because i'm afraid that i will not sleep. I tried to analyze everything, but that made things even worse.When i'm at a low, i do not see any light or chance of betterment (if you know what i mean).At one point, i was free. And i slowly realized that if my anxiety is gone, the problems will be gone too.Since that day i'm improving and i'm able to stop panicattacks etc.In the last two weeks i slept very well, even with anxiety.But i can't break through it completly, because the fear is sometimes so plausible to me .( i know that those are lies).In the following days i will sleep in a differtent place with changing bedtime and i'm afraid that i will find no rest.(I know that these are just thoughts)Has anyone tipps for how i can break through this completly?Right now i'm believing every lie my thoughts tell me and i know it sounds stupid, but i'm so fucking afraid.
NotSignal	I don’t consume caffeine, im on third week i can’t sleep and i see all those insomniacs that are exhausted and can’t sleep. But in my case, im not tired, I cannot fall asleep. Like there’s no “tiring” hormone in my fucking brain help. :( I workout to exhaust my body but the tiredness just last temporary
Signal	I've been getting 2 hours of sleep for some time now im back on 4 and when i get really lucky once in 3 or 4 days i get 5 or 6 hours, but still not back to my full 8 hours&#x200B;what has helped: 1. SCHEDULE(most important thing ever, get my mind busy, actually work, talk to people)\- 1. may sound hard as f if you are struggling alot right now, but trust me it will work if you are not having really strong depressions and anxiety, i got them to a level where i still controll myself2.Teas (Sleepy time tea, chamomile)3.Melatonin(not using it anymore since its not natural)what didn't help:\- OTC sleeping pills,\- herbal tablettes(they do help for your stress levels but not falling asleep inmy case)
NotSignal	Title says all. Im young (20) years old who always slept good. This sunday, i was awake all the way until 8:30 am because i had a fast heart beat but what bothered me the most was the pulse i was feeling in my chest from my heart. It kept me up. Slept fine monday but Wednesday came and i was up until 9:30 am. Was from eating fast food late at night which accelerated my heart. Right nowX my main concern is the pulse i feel in my chest from my heart that keeps me up. Anyways my point of posting is if anyone feels a bit scared about sleeping, hoping they can get a few hours a sleep and trying to not worry about a fast heart beat or feeling their heart in their chest?
NotSignal	And if sleeping in the same bed next to me, it helped immensely in calming down enough so I can sleep. Has anyone else had such experiences? For me it worked better with dogs, but cats are doing the trick too, especially after purring.
Signal	Recently started cycling n trying to eat right, did this for a couple weeks. But then decided to stop as it was starting to drain me paired up with my inability to sleep. Cycling 30k a day only to get maybe 1-2hrs of actual solid sleep wasn’t doing it. I spent the last several days doing literally nothing, I have zero mental energy rn. My parents won’t turn down the thermostat, they insist on having it at 68deg all the time. Parents n brother r wearing long pants, sweaters n shit, have the furnace, have the fireplace on as well, the house is fckn 20deg inside and they’re still cold but refuse to wear warmer clothes. Meanwhile I’m in my boxers ALL the time n I’m still hot as hell. My bedroom is a literal sauna. I’m back in the habit of only sleeping every second day, for 3hrs at a time at most. Currently been up for over 24hrs, managed to sleep maybe 3hrs the other day around noon. This is normal for me. Starting to get depressed again. Suicidal ideation creeping up. If they would just turn the heat off at night n let me crack my window open. My mom always pretends to be concerned and yet she goes out of her way to impede all my efforts to sleep, then they wonder y i don’t have energy or drive. So fckn ignorant. I don’t know if they’re genuinely stupid and don’t comprehend, or if they just don’t care bc it’s not their problem. Prob both tbh. I’m young, I don’t smoke, don’t drink, no drugs etc, but I don’t sleep. It’s aging me, it’s what’s going to kill me, either directly or indirectly if/when I decide to say fck it n end my life bc of it
Signal	Hello, my name’s Greg, and as the title reads, I wake up 8+ times a night, every night, and have been doing so for more or less about nine months. I take 150mg of trazodone, 3mg of melatonin, valerian root, and 25mg of unisom each night. I also take 20mg of Prozac each morning. I’ve been to several sleep counselors, none have helped much. My sleep environment is very solid, and always has been. I have anger issues, occasional depression and anxiety. I need suggestions, I’m very frustrated. Thank you, truly.
NotSignal	I stayed up for 20 hours yesterday in attempts of staying up the full 24 to reset my internal clock lol my friend told me to do since I ran out of ideas. I go to bed around 10pm then I randomly flail around and woke up at 2:40...haven’t been able to sleep since then. I really thought tonight I was going to sleep for a whole 8 hours or even more and nope. I even woke up with a horrible migraine. Are there doctors that we can have online consultations with to get sleep medication prescribed?? I have been given hydrocodone for something I recently went through and that’s the only thing that can knock me out for longer than 4-5 hours but I obviously don’t want to pick up a habit of taking it just to sleep. I just want my normal healthy sleep schedule back.):
NotSignal	This I just the worst. Should I cancel the meeting (it’s a 30min drive) or should I tough it out and try it anyways.
Signal	So I’m twenty, and during my teens it was believed that I was narcoleptic, based on my mothers diagnosis and certain symptoms I’d been showing around 15-17. When I was 15 however I had a sleep study done where they figured it was inconclusive due to certain things countering the idea that I was such as inability to fall asleep quick enough.I have also been diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD, and so they believed if I was narcoleptic than they could just “treat” my ADHD with Vyvanse and I’d probably be okay.In late 2018, I was putting a youth rehab facility for addiction to meth, cocaine, and MDMA. During the first week I visited my psychiatrist and he out me on 10mg Zopiclone and raised my Vyvanse. Fast forward to now, I’m on 15 mg Zopiclone, 1 mg of Clonazepam, and 100 mg of Trazadone, and I can’t stay asleep no matter what I do to help maximize the effects of the drug.On another note, I am currently taking 40 mg Vyvanse because I had switched to fast acting Dextroamphetamine for about a month and went off 60 Mg of vyvanse, but my doc is working me back up to that rate soon:I just feel like I’m going insane and could maybe use some advice, this is my first time posting to this sub so I figured I’s try it out.
NotSignal	Hi guys! I am heavily addicted to cannabis and would like to stop to gain some control. Unfortunately, since i am at a gram of distillate a day habit, its not going to be easy to quit and the sleep element always becomes main issue for me. I just cant do without and it's the main factor in every relapse.My question to you folks is has anyone taken sleeping pills for a short period of time specifically to combat cannabis withdrawals to get some sleep and then stopped with no problems ? Any rebound ?So far i have tried promethazine and also melatonin. They are only mildly effective not very useful for me. My issue is that i have ADHD so already struggle with poor sleep architecture as it is. I cannot sleep through the night without waking up multiple times even with the cannabis and melatonin or antihistamines in my system. Tolerance to cannabis is a big factor too. I do not drink.I need to be able to sleep reliably 3 times a week to allow me to get up at 6AM for my 12hr shift as a carer, so without sleep I could mess up and maybe make a meds error! The rest of the days i could just deal with i guess.I am not open to taking benzos or kratom, however I am open to and can source ambien/zopiclone/prescription meds as well as herbal/natural options. And i just know it will be suggested, so ill say that ive worked hard at sleep hygeine for over a year now with small but disappointing results. I would be greatful if you could share your experiences! Thanks a lot and have a great day
NotSignal	Has anyone tried these 3 treatments for insomnia? I'm inquiring for my best friend who has crippling insomnia and has been battling with it for years. She says shes able to fall asleep but has immense trouble staying asleep. I've seen her myself twitch and just be restless while asleep, which jolts her awake. We've chalked it up to stress but there's times when its definitely not just stress. Her doctors have also concluded her period affects her sleep to some degree, but constant hormone suppression is not a long term solution and I fear it's destroying her physical health. If any of you have any personal feedback on valerian root or any other more natural supplements that I didnt mention here that would be super helpful.
NotSignal	It’s 4am where I am, I could get an hour of rest or just stay up. Which is worse ?
NotSignal	Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like their brain is probably just really different and unique and that's why nothing works? Like there's something unique about you that's makes it impossible to fix no matter what you do? Just trying to get a sense how common it is to feel this way.
Signal	So on January 1st I developed middle Insomnia, prior to this day I slept like a baby. Prior to January 1st I was coming of anabolic steroids (fuck this shit) and had just come back from vacation where I binge drank like crazy 30-40 drinks a night.So January 1st - 10th I couldn't sleep through the night. I had no problem going to sleep but would wake up 4-5 hours into my sleep unable to go back due to anxiety.My doc prescribed me Trazodone 50mg which has been bullet proof since. I even did a week at 25mg, however aat the end of the week I again woke up one night unable to return to sleep and at this point I said fuck it I'm going back on full 50mg.I'm feeling my underlying issues are starting to remedy... how can I start playing around with coming of this drug?regards,me
NotSignal	Hi, I am 17 and have had insomnia for about 4 years now. It was never too bad as I could usually get about 6 hours of sleep and be fine, but for about half a year it has gotten worse.I constantly wake up with stomach aches and dry, burning eyes. I also have a bit of a sore throat and it hurts to swallow.For anyone who has shared some of these symptoms, what has helped you out? I wanted to ask you guys because my doctor just says it’s a result from anxiety,and I honestly don’t think so.
NotSignal	Not really insomnia but the opposite problem. I always feel extremely tired after waking up and not well rested. I got a Apple Watch recently and initial records show I always wake up during deep sleep and not light sleep. Any advice to tackle this?
NotSignal	Its 12am right now and I’m at my wits end. I dont have insomnia however tonight I am urinating every 30 minutes and have for the past 3 hours, I have no idea whats going on and I’m slightly worried Small info about me (25F) that might be a reason for it? - im on stimulant medication but I have been on it for 5 months with no issues- I’m on the last day of my period- I have upped my water intake the past few days but only drinking 1.5 litres (nothing crazy) and majority of that water is drunk by about 5pm - Ive started taking magnesium tablets (4th day) and this is the first time this has happened Its not even small ‘streams’ its as if my bladder is filling up so quickly, my pee is also totally clear Whats going on :(
Signal	Hey everyone. This is my first post on reddit. I specifically made my account to post here and get some advice from other people going through what I am going through. I am a nurse. About a month ago I experienced a very traumatic thing happen to me at work. I can’t go into details because it was patient related and thats against hippa. But when I say traumatic, I mean, ever since I have not slept one night and I have all the classic symptoms of PTSD. I struggled with insomnia in the past... years ago. I was given mitrazipine and it gave me nightmares. Then I was given the lowest dose of trazadone and that worked. I took that for a long time. It made me very drowsy the following morning. Detox was awful trying to get off of it. For a few years I didn’t have to take anything to help me sleep. Then I began my nursing career as a rotator. I was having a hard time sleeping after night shifts. Benedryl worked at first but then it stopped. I was given clonopin which worked at first but then it stopped working. I was prescribed hydroxizine and that stopped working. I was told to take it with benedryl and that worked for a while until the event happened. After the event my doctor wanted me to try trazadone again since it worked for me in the past. I started with the lowest dose, that didn’t work. She upped my dose, it worked but I had night mares and woke up sweating so she took me off of it really quickly. She then prescribed me lunesta. I was very scared to take it because I am a nurse and I know ambien and lunesta (hypnotics) can have very bad side effects and be very addicting. But the doctor gave me no other choice. I tried 1 mg, didn’t work. 2 mg, didn’t work. She told me to keep trying it. I’ve been taking 2 mg for about a week now. It helps me fall asleep sometimes but I can only stay asleep for 2 hours and then I’m up tossing and turning all night long. I’m beginning to lose all hope. I applied for my medical marijuana card but that can take a look while to get approved... anyone have a similar experience to share or friendly advice? I haven’t been able to go back to work yet because I can’t sleep at night and it wouldn’t be safe for me to care for patients. I just want my normal life back.
Signal	I had severe (often total) insomnia as a child and in my early 20s and did not take anything at the time for the problem. In my teens, I woke up a few times with severe shortness of breath, one of which I went to the ER for; the more severe shortness of breath episode lasted for about 24 hours in which my chest was so tight that I physically could not breathe. Of course, they tried to tell me it was a panic attack, but it was definitely physical--with panic on top because I couldn't breathe! After that more severe episode, I would have little one-time spasms here and there that would make me gasp audibly.I'm 30 now and have been taking medication for my insomnia that includes prescription (Lunesta and Klonopin) and natural supplements (l-theanine, magnesium, melatonin). I feel like the natural supplements especially have been making my shortness of breath episodes more frequent. I have had two episodes in the past month. The first one happened after weeks of taking l-theanine and went away after I stopped taking the supplement. The second one started a few days ago after I took some magnesium and melatonin supplements and has been persisting still even though I haven't taken anything since Friday. I went to the local clinic on Friday because I felt like I was going to pass out since I couldn't catch my breath. I have read that melatonin can affect asthma. The clinic gave me IV fluids since I've been struggling with dehydration too from a stomach bug and thought that might be causing me to feel faint.Anyone have similar effects when taking meds for anxiety/sleeping?
Signal	I never had problems with sleep until December of 2019. Ever since then, it's hard for me to fall asleep.I go to bed around 9:30PM and sometimes when I don't need to wake up next morning, I'll go at 11PM. It doesn't matter what time I go to bed, I'll always fall asleep at 12AM and wake up more than 5 times during sleeping. And now this is where it gets kinda weird. If I hear ANY sound around me, I can't fall asleep. Even my BREATHING annoys me, that's right, BREAAATHIIING. Problem is, I share my room with a little bro, and he snores A LOT. Another thing is, I am building muscle, but with insomnia, the muscles won't grow that much. If anyone wants to ask how old I am, I am 15. Please, help me, I tried everything. A tea before bed, milk, no looking at a screen 2 hours before sleep, read a book before bed and many more stuff I tried. I am tired of this.
NotSignal	I've had insomnia for over fifteen, hell closer to twenty years at this point. If I can fall asleep I wake up ever two hours rarely getting more than five hours or I just stay awake and still don't get more than five hours at any point, with nightmares nightly. I've woken up with bruised legs do to tossing and turning. I was in a car accident where I got a concussion and I still barely slept. I still have post concussion and im always tired yet sleep isn't there. For a short time I felt like I was doing a bit better that I got up to six or seven hours. But now it seems like my sleep (or lack of) pattern has returned. I've tried medications, sleeping pills, weed (it's legal where I am) and even meditation. I exhausted.
Signal	The past week it’s been easy for me to sleep but not tonight. I got weird sensations mostly in my legs and then my head like jerked. I tried to sleep again but I heard like a muffled banging sound (not like exploding head syndrome) and I’m scared to go to sleep now. My head is racing and I’m scared.
NotSignal	Sometimes I go through a period of time where I can stay up all night and day and I don’t get sleepy at all. It’s not just that I can’t sleep, it’s that I don’t feel the need to at all. It’s super weird
NotSignal	My sleep schedule is completely Messed off that want to mess it up it’s very hard to fix and it takes a lot of dedication so I might just have to stay up for a day and see if I can make it work that way which is not going to be the best on my sick body but we’ll see I’m bored what are you guys up to?
NotSignal	Of course insomnia is tough and inconvenient.But what is something good that comes from having it?
NotSignal	I have a weird sleep schedule. I generally don’t go to bed or fall asleep until 5-9am. I wake up around 4:30pm for work if I’m working or 5:30 for dinner. Today I’ve been trying to sleep since 9am, almost 4 hours. I finally got to sleep around noon. Only to wake up 20 minutes later to my dog barking a bunch. I know know I was asleep cause I thought it was 4 and work was calling or something. It didn’t make sense that the dog would be barking. I go downstairs to see what the dog is barking at. She looked terrified of me. We’re her 3rd family and her first was likely abusive so she always looks terrified when she realized she’s doing something bad. I go downstairs to see the out front door is wide open, and the dog is barking at another dog. My uncle (who just needed to stay with us for a few days, 11 months ago, and is still here) was sitting on the front porch petting his sister’s dog who lives across the street. My family is bad at social distancing cause they’re boomers. I’m just pissed. I don’t know if I have work tonight. I have fibromyalgia and when I don’t sleep then I’m in pain. The dog didn’t bark again though. But I’m still awake.
Signal	Always when I go to sleep I can only sleep for 5-6 hours (I usually sleep 7-8) and then when I try to go to sleep again I only sleep about 20 minutes before waking up again. This has been going on for 5 days and I can't take it anymore. I just have no energy in the day, don't feel rested and can't concentrate. Also. Always when I lay somewhere (rarely also when sitting comfortable) my brain (every 5-10 minutes or so) goes into a half-sleep (if you could call it that). Like it's really weird because when then something slightly changes in my surrounding I instantly wake up while hearing a loud clap sound. I can't remember anything from the time I was in half-sleep and I then am always really confused for the next few minutes (Which kind of makes sense). So basically my brain sometimes goes into a really really light weird sleep. I've never had anything like this before. PS's: I am slightly paranoid (maybe that could factor in. idk). This whole thing started when I got the new bed but the new bed feels exactly like the old one. Idk if this belongs to this subreddit (idk if this counts as a sleep disorder) so if somebody is having trouble with this post just comment or delete.
Signal	I hope this is the right thread to vent in. I'm not sharing it with my friends and family anymore because they make an even bigger fuss about it and it makes me anxious. None of the experience insomnia so it's a big deal to them. I've read somewhere that chronic insomnia is when you don't sleep for 3-4 nights a few times a month (correct me if I'm wrong), and that would be my case atm. I didn't sleep for 4 nights 2 weeks ago, and while writing this, this is my 4th night going on again.It had never been this severe before. I started experiencing insomnia 3 years ago. It would happen maybe 3 times a year. The longest I've gone without sleep is 5 nights. I was anxious the first two times it happened, but now I don't really panic about it. It was very severe 3 years ago. My anxiety was through the roof so I mainly blamed it on that. I would feel quite anxious and would get heart palpitations while trying to fall asleep. I went to the doctor then and I was prescribed benzos. They worked. I still struggle with anxiety but it's been okay since then.I usually fall asleep around midnight-1AM. I don't stay up too late. I go to the gym usually (pre covid lifestyle). I avoid eating after 7PM. I don't have any health issues that I know of except for anxiety and depression. I feel pretty okay physically. I feel even better than I did 3 years ago.Well the insomnia I've been experiencing for the past month is **nothing like before**. My anxiety is stable. My thoughts don't rush at night. No heart palpitations. I feel tired. I can sense when I'm ready to sleep. I tried chamomile tea and showering before bed, but nope. I've also had quite a few active days where I'd feel immensely tired, but by the time I was supposed to sleep, it didn't help. My brain is just unable to switch to a state of sleep.I asked my mom if she had any sleeping pills on hand, as I'm unable to visit a doctor atm. I don't have any benzos on hand. It was a zolpidem drug brand. It made me paranoid and I had a really weird reaction. It did help me fall asleep but it was one of the weirdest experiences in my life.I needed a place to vent but suggestions are welcome. I just need that one night of sleep in order to get my sleeping cycle back to normal. What I found has helped me in the past was cutting out caffeine for a month. I've started doing that as of today again. It's just been hard with all the school work I have to do with my lethargic state.
Signal	For the past couple of weeks my insomnias been getting bad, i would get restless sleep for like tow hours then wake up so tired i feel like passing out. I managed to get my hands on some sleep aids cuz we started school last sunday, but its getting harder and harder.. i would sleep at like 1am or 12 and wake up at 3 or 4.. stay up till school at 9.. attend then take a nap at 1 for like 20 mins and then repeat. Rn its 4am and i havent managed to sleep just yet, i feel groggy and tired and breathless and idk what im gonna do.. its my senior year so i have to pay attention and stuff but fml if
NotSignal	This weeks marks a month since I’ve started my third shift job, and let me tell you, this truly has been the most agonizing experience. My sleep has literally been fucked. I’m barely evening functioning during my shift, but as soon as get off in the morning, my ass literally cannot sleep at all. Zombie during shift, dead awake after. Tons of sleep debt and sleep deprivation symptoms I hate this. I honestly have made the worst decision in my life. The pay isn’t not even worth it to me.
NotSignal	the most days that i haven't slept is 6 days. Until my doctor gave me seroquel, i've slept for like an hour, I've stopped taking it tho because it gave me heartaches during the morning. Next medication that i've tried is sinequan, it doesn't do anything for me, it doesnt make me tired and i still wake up 4-6times a night. Now im on temazepam, it still doesnt do anything, i dont feel tired but now i only wake up 2times a night and it makes me sluggish. I need help! thank you
Signal	I have a script for both (previously zopi but asked for Ativan because of anxiety). Is it fine to take both in alternance?
Signal	First time taking 10mg, haven’t eaten for 4 hours so the medication would work better. It’s been about 20mins since I took it, can I eat now or will that slow down the effects of the ambien?
Signal	Yesterday, I told myself that I would do literally everything I can think of to help me sleep, because today, I have a performance at 10 o'clock and I need to be focused and have energy. Last time I remember seeing on the clock was 9:57, so right before I fell asleep, I was super proud. Woke up before midnight. Could not fall asleep after ;-; So basically, I got a typical <2 hours of sleep, just in a different time slot than usual. Here I come, to mess up the performance and make my teacher and fellow performers look bad.
NotSignal	I don’t have insomnia per se (never diagnosed although I fit the description well) but I do have trouble sleeping related to other things. What seems to help you sleep that isn’t a pill or melatonin? I have tried multiple things already including the things above and it’s getting to the point where I can’t ignore my sleeping problems anymore as I often lie awake for hours. I’d just like to hear what helps you as a place to start.
NotSignal	So luckily I was able to fall asleep last night around 1 and seemed to wake up around 7, the thing is everyday I wake up feeling Unrefreshed is there a good reason for that? I notice my lungs also feel heavy. Has anyone been like this and solved/fixed it? I just want to rest well again that's all...... It's been 8 weeks.
NotSignal	Sorry if not the right sub, not sure where else. Anyone else get this? We're gonna see a doc tomorrow about it because it's becoming more frequent, like once a week. When it happens it keeps her up a long time because she's scared. Thanks
Signal	I wake up from bad dreams during my final REM cycle (around 5am) and it leaves me completely wrecked all day. Can anyone relate or can recommend a medication to help. I suffer with anxiety and depression as well, which Im taking an antidepressant for (Parnate a MAOI).
NotSignal	I cant do this shit again I couldnt sleep at night again. I have work in 2 hours and after yesterday I dont even know what the fuck I'm going to do. I can feel heart palpations and and freaking the fuck out again.
Signal	Hey everyone new here, been having trouble sleeping for most of my life so i figured why not post about my experience and current situation. I'm 27 and been dealing with sleeping issues for half my life. I've had periods where i can sleep fine, then then periods when it is difficult to sleep. i'd say for 10 years, i've mainly slept between 6am-8am to anywhere between 12-5pm, i used to be on the laptop all night and then recently in the last 3 years i've switched to playing xbox because at the time my sleeping was giving me anxiety and i started playing games with people i met on xbox and it helped me relax and not think about stress and i used to go to bed at 6 am and then wake up 12-3pm and keep continuing, i'd have periods where my sleeping would be bad but then would eventually get over it.About a month ago our youngest dog got hit by a car because he escaped out of the house and i wasn't home and mom didn't realize he escaped and if i was home, it wouldn't of happened, then 2 weeks later my oldest dog who was around 20 years old, i had him when i was 12 had to be put down because he was suffering and then i became addicted to this grind in a game and it took me 120 hours to complete and i think that gave me anxiety as well because i was having trouble switching off sleeping but i still managed to sleep for more then 3 hours at a time and now that i finished it i feel bad anxiety when i get ready to go to bed like i am trying to force myself to sleep. On the weekend my family decided to go out for the day and i don't know why because it hasn't effected me before but i had this feeling of loneliness i guess of wanting to do things with my family but never able to because i would sleep in the morning and by the time i woke up half or most of the day would be gone. i decided to try and reset my entire sleep pattern the other night by trying to stay up all night, i ended up crashing at 12pm and sleeping on and off every 1-3 hours until 2am. thought i'd try to do an all nighter but fell asleep at 530am and woke up around 8am and thought great.Tonight though as been very difficult, felt very jaded all through the day, went to bed at 9.30 fell asleep at around 11-1130 woke up at 1 fell asleep around 2 then woke up at 3 and it's now 5 am.i honestly don't know what to do, i feel like i have to mentally drain myself to even go to sleep and one thing that always helps me is listening to a certain video that i have but for some reason that's stopped helping and i don't know what to do because i want to sleep in general and probably best bet is sleeping in the morning to lunch time but then i don't want to miss out on doing things with my family but then if i sleeping at a normal time, it takes ages to fall asleep and when i do if i do, i barely stay asleep.Sorry for the long post but i wasn't sure weather to post this but seeing as how i can't sleep, i thought might as well post this then just laying in bed doing nothing.
NotSignal	I already have trouble sleeping but now these past few days I’ve been getting a urge in my leg and it got worse and now I know it’s restless leg syndrome... FUCK
NotSignal	Guys. This insomnia is all In our heads. I cured myself before, only to have it come back again. On the nights I don't care, I sleep. On the nights I worry, I don't sleep. Anyone ever try and stay awake on purpose, just to prove to yourself your body will ALWAYS sleep?
NotSignal	So my problem is now that i will fall asleep and then after sleeping a few minutes, i randomly wake up. I recorded myself sleeping for a few minutes, and then suddenly woke up for no apparent reason. Has this happened to anyone before? I get sleepy and all, but I’ll only sleep for a few minutes at a time.
NotSignal	I took some cbd, put on some rain sounds white noise video and managed to sleep around 8 hours with a break. Oh and my brothers co-worker tested negative for coronavirus, and a huge weight is lifted off my shoulders. I'm thankful for this community being here when I needed it.
NotSignal	Usually I fall asleep around 04:30 or 05:00, but here's the thing; I stay up all night on Xbox talking to friends and binge watching shows on Hulu and Netflix, but if I stay up for too long, go to bed, and if I see the sun rising, it's like what's the point, y'know? I've done this countless times because I don't wanna mess up my sleep schedule and I'm gonna be going into town to do a few things. I just hope I can stay awake around 01:00 or 02:00 so I can get a good nights rest.This seems more of a rant to me, but hey, just sayin' how I feel about it. Anyone else do this?
Signal	Hello everyone. It’s currently 7:44am as I write this post.Just some background, I’m 18 years old and I would describe my insomnia as occasional. By ‘occasional’ I mean that once every 2-3 months I will just have a night where no matter how hard I try, I can’t get to sleep. I don’t know why this is at all but I have noticed that when I try to think about things I normally would on a regular night (e.g. what I did during the day, creating stories in my head, etc. which lets me drift off) I just struggle to keep them together and therefore can’t dose off. Sorry if that’s difficult to understand it is really hard to explain.Then when the clock reaches 5am and past I start worrying about not getting enough sleep and becoming ill which only makes me more nervous in return decreasing the chances I will sleep. Even on my bad nights I usually do manage to get to sleep around 7am but this night has been different because I am also genuinely sick.The only thing I can think of right now is “what happens if I’m like this tomorrow?” and the thought of not sleeping for 48 hours frightens me more than anything.Sorry if this is a long read but I am just hoping for some advice and to see if my issue is relatable to anyone here.Thanks for reading!
Signal	Since I was around 14 years old, I've struggled with insomnia. I would go days without sleeping, and when I did sleep I would never feel rested. Then I would go into phase where my brain and body couldn't take it anymore and I passed out. I trudged on though, I'm a happy go lucky type of person; so, every one has seen me as a super energetic, eccentric person. But it really was just a facade. I would go home and crash and feel miserable. As I got into college I missed morning classes regularly. I would just lie in bed and be just miserable. I felt in a depressive like state because I was just so exhausted. I really thought this would be the rest of my life. But something just hit me in September. I don't know what it was, how it happened, or anything. I just felt more motivated than ever. I started eating better, being more active, paying more attention in school (not that I was a bad student; but I was strictly just a 3.0 student.) I took more self care days, thinking about my mental health. Was accepted into a prestigious internship, started dating my amazing supportive girlfriend. I pushed myself to changed my life. And then I just started sleeping better. My insomnia was slowly fading away. As I got in a routine, I wake up early every morning to go to work and school. Went to bed early. I started sleeping 4 hours a night. Then 5,and now I'm at 6 & 1/2. But I'm sleeping every night. I wish I could help you secrets or tips how I over came it. But it just happened. I changed my life and didn't just work on my sleep but my mental and physical state as a whole. I just felt like sharing my story.
Signal	Per a blood test, my DHEA-S is very elevated at 672! I think this is the cause of my insomnia and anxiety because if you look at side effects of DHEA supplementation, they list anxiety, panic and insomnia. I just learned that Mirtazapine lowers DHEA so will try that soon. Have any of you had your DHEA-S measured?
Signal	I give up on trying supplements and music and routines to try and get my sleep to just be normal. I asked my doc for something not habit forming and potentially safe for long term use and he gave me this. Anyone have experience with trazodone?
NotSignal	Hi,for the past few days I've been only sleeping a like 3-4h a night and every time I'd wake up every 1-2h remembering vividly what I was dreaming about. The pattern of waking up every few hours and remembering the dream goes back further. Upon googling it, Sporadic Fatal Insomnia came up which obviously freaked me out. Any ideas what could be causing this other than SFI? How is it possible to remember the dreams after sleeping for such a short time if it's not SFI? Isn't it impossible to enter REM and have a vivid dream in such a short time if you don't have that condition?
Signal	I’ve always dealt with depression and insomnia and have been taking Zoloft + Trazadone for 9 years. My boyfriend passed away in April from alcoholism and that has obviously hit me hard coupled with the isolation from quarantine. Him and I did not date for long, but we totally fell in love so it’s been quite traumatic to say the least. I’ve always dealt with severe loneliness too, but with my meds, I’ve been able to manage. Last week, my OBGYN (not my psychiatrist who usually prescribes me my meds) prescribed me Ambien last week and I’ve taken it three times. I’m not sure if it’s related, but this past week I’ve had so many suicidal and hopeless thoughts that I’ve never felt. I have felt so much anxiety, which is also new. Could this be attributed to Ambien? I’m hoping this is the culprit and the reason for these sudden surge of negative thoughts. If so, I’ll immediately stop taking the Ambien. I’m really hoping it’s as simple as that and an easy fix because I can usually manage my mental health with the medicines I’ve always been on. I think the addition of Ambien really threw me into a spiral. Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone have advice? I’d truly appreciate it.
Signal	I don't usually have Insomnia, I only have it when I'm stressed or anxious, which is today. I slept around 11pm and woke up at around 1am and haven't slept since. Also school starts in 2 hours and I was looking forward to it since this week has been going well and I've been productive, but today will probably be a horrible day. I'm going to try to be energized and stay focused as much as I can, I also take adderall so hopefully that'll help? Anyways have a good day everyone.
NotSignal	Does anyone have to have an absolute fight with themselves to wake up after doing everything possible to go to sleep every night? I don't know which is my worst issue, going to sleep or getting up. I'll wake up, at any tiny noise. But once I'm asleep, unless I'm forced to fully wake up by something other than just me convincing me I need to, it takes hours. I also have migraines and symptoms from lymes. I wake up with my ears ringing, and my head full of pressure. Also, it takes so long, and so much effort to fall asleep, that once I actually do, I try so hard to stay there.
NotSignal	I swear to god. The only time this EVER happens to me is when I have a very early meeting or appointment the next morning. Why. Why???
NotSignal	So my sleep habits have been awfully sloth like for years, I really love sleeping and I can easily sleep for 12-14hours (if I have nothing to do and left to sleep) and no matter if I have 1 alarm or 4 alarms, I can go back to sleep but I usually have good action in actually getting up if i know I need to be somewhere. I would say i’m a deep sleeper and I love dreaming. I consider this to be why I love sleeping so much because I enjoy watching my dreams so much, they are sometimes so vivid and so creatively strange that if something wakes me up, I want to continue it. Like most people, I can also run better on 3/4hours of sleep consistently for a certain period of time but most the time I am always tired and lethargic without specifically coffee in my system. I take vitamin supplements which have all the vitamins you can possibly imagine and I drink plenty of water & eat a balanced diet. I do drink caffeine via tea or coffee but only coffee keeps me energetically awake.Ever since lock down began I’ve just been staying up so late, for eg. it’s currently 4:30am... but some nights its 5:30am and it’s already daylight by this point which therefore forces me to try and get some sleep. I have contemplated it but haven’t tried staying up all day yet because I feel I won’t make it through the whole day to evening when I should go to sleep and napping seems to defeat the aim of staying awake. What do you think is the best way to truly reset my circadian rhythm?I have succumbed to just allowing my body to naturally wake me up without an alarm which has been successful a couple of times in not being so late but most times i wake up too early (consciously knowing i haven’t had enough sleep) so i fall back to sleep and then wake up a couple times but still going back to sleep until between 2pm-3:30pm (because i’m dreaming even more vividly now during quarantine) which apparently is when I think is a socially acceptable boundary in my household to wake up at which therefore continues the lack of tiredness at these early hours.However, I am tired throughout the day probably because I rarely do anything, occasional exercise and going for a run/walk but when still in bed, I tell you I could easily sleep longer than when I wake up (but hunger is the true reason to get up), also, I have to eat at 1/2am because i’m so hungry by this time of the night. Another point to add is that my blinds are slat blinds and my room is at the front of the house which means I can get easy light exposure but that doesn’t affect me, I am annoyingly the type of person who can sleep anywhere, any time and even if I wake up and go on my phone for a bit, get out of bed for the toilet, sit up in bed, I can still fall back asleep rather easily because I love sleeping. (in case that hasn’t been clear from the post) Overall, this sounds like I have a problem and I do recognise this but I have no motivation to have a routine but I know my sleep pattern is unhealthy and irregular. My sleep hygiene is not great either, the one good thing I have been doing for months is listening to a sleep meditation every night to fall asleep within 20mins! I do believe in having a healthy lifestyle but during these times which are unknown when to end for me (UK resident) I don’t know what to do. I don’t have much to do in the day to keep me busy which is why sleeping half day seems okay but somehow I’m on my laptop/phone til early hours in the morning.Thanks for reading! Please help!
NotSignal	i quit my job today and have about 2 weeks until i start my new one and i know my insomnia will be awful so i need some suggestions on how to occupy my time.
Signal	I’ve always sort of struggle with insomnia. mostly, it happens when I have something important to do the next day and my self-sabotage kicks in and makes it impossible to get rest. the worst part is my heart racing. I can’t seem to control it. I try breathing exercises and try to refocus my thoughts, but I still continue to self sabotage. last night for example I finally slept at 6am until 9:30. this is not ideal but I’m so thankful to even have gotten 3 hours of sleep. I’d even have taken two Tylenol PMs and a CBD oil capsule yet my anxiety over powered them both.what has worked for you guys in terms of beating insomnia? I feel like I have sleep OCD which causes me to need a very specific sleep setting (like my own bed, alone) and then I continue to count how much sleep I’m going to get which makes me even more anxious and results in so little sleep. help wanted
NotSignal	If you want to read about my sleep struggles then check out my last post. I just want to know what medication is the best one. Is there something other than melatonin that works better? How much mg should I take? Is there a certain brand that works better than others?
Signal	I’ve had insomnia issues my whole life off and on. Lately I’ve been able to fall asleep, but I’m not waking up refreshed at all. I sleep veeeerry lightly, like I’m 1/4 awake all night. It’s really weird and it fucking sucks.
NotSignal	Hello there everyone.I've had a normally regular sleeping pattern up until recently. (I've been able to sleep at around 12:00 and wake up at 7, and I experience the feeling of being tired before sleeping in the evenings.)My current situation as of recent is that I've recently not been feeling tired at all, no matter what I do. Attempting to do everything from reducing my screentime to taking a warm shower before trying to initiate sleep has left me without results. I'm stuck dead awake for hours without feeling tired or sleepy only to sleep during the daytime when my body eventually crashes (if at all.).I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for what I can do to try and fall asleep. I'm beginning to get really stressed out and worried about my sudden inability to sleep or my lack of feeling tired, and I want to know if there are any ways I can will myself to fall asleep easier.
NotSignal	Could this be anxiety? I had this problem as a kid.
Signal	ive tried trazadone, melatonin, natural supplements like tea and other natural pills & clonidine. whenever i research into it i dont see many more options online for insomnia other than xanax, ambien, lorazepam and temazepam. anyone got recommendations? im willing to try anything even if its benzo/controlled substances. thanks!
Signal	Throwaway account. So my sleep issues date back to a little over a year ago. I had recently moved into a ranch house on a block where all the lots are close together, and my jerk neighbor bought a high-performance car that would wake me up at 4:30am every morning when he left for work. I tried all the usual measures (talking to him, looking into city ordinances) but nothing helped, so I sold the house, which sucked but was just kind of whatever. I'm in a better environment now, but I still wake up around 4-4:30 every morning during the week even without any external stimuli; It's as if a new sleeping pattern was imprinted into my brain that I can't shake, and the resulting anxiety has made it such that I get very little REM sleep (according to my FitBit, at least). I take some Trazadone before bed to calm me down and have tried traditional CBT, laying off caffeine and I exercise regularly, but a full night of restful, relatively uninterrupted sleep continues to prove elusive. Has anyone had any similar experiences and methods that have worked?
Signal	So I've been on melatonin for over a year now and I'm also taking lamotrogine for my epilepsy. And before lockdown occurred my sleep patterns where ok(ish), being the usual fall asleep time of 11:45 to around 12:30 (you know the usual fall asleep time of a teenager). But being away from college and having everything being changed for months has really affected my sleep schedule in massive ways. The main thing being I fall asleep around 2:00 to 3:30 now which is seriously affecting the small seizures which I havent had in months and making me feel depressed, giving me major mood swings. It makes me wake up late to my lessons every day, and when I do tire myself out during the day it doesn't affect my bad sleeping pattern at all. It doesnt help that my parents are giving me driving lessons almost every day, especially when I'm at my worst, being tired wise. I sleep with my phone powered off at the far end of my room to prevent me from looking at it every 5 minutes and I also sleep with my sleep mask on because my brain is especially active at night time compared to the day. I seriously don't know what to do anymore and I'm close to just accepting it and the seizures which occur during the morning. Being at home has made me really struggle with work, since I have a very active brain and waking up late at 10:30 every morning and being mostly awake by 12:30 has made me feel depressed and useless.As I said before I dont know what to do and I dont even know why I'm writing this because theres not much you people can do to help :(
NotSignal	I haven’t slept in like 3 days and i feel so tired but I just can’t go to sleep, now I’m on my phone and won’t sleep at all :(
Signal	Hi! Honestly, I think I'm fucking losing it. I'm in a constant state of exhaustion, mentally and physically but at the same time just have so much energy that I'm constantly physically active. Like when you're running on no sleep and that mid-day adrenaline kicks in? I don't know what's going on to be honest. I think it started 6 months ago, even though I've always had a really bad sleep schedule and I've always been somewhat nocturnal/had trouble falling asleep. My bedtimes in the past have always been past midnight, usually in the 1-4 a.m. mark.I kind of developed a paranoia when I lay down in my bed at night. My heart starts beating really fast and I kind of hyper-focus on the noise around me, like the sound of whatever object that's being blown by my a/c or fan, could be a plastic bag, or whatever. I fixed this recently by having the TV play so there's white noise covering whatever background noise while I sleep. I have a habit of staring into the dark and assuming something's there, so the TV's also a source of light that reassures me.One time, I was awoken by this REALLY loud sound against the blades of my fan? It's not a traditional fan, but kind of like a portable a/c, so the blades aren't spinning.. Think a fan blowing but there's blind-like panels in front instead of the blades. The sound of it was like someone's fingers dragging across them really strongly. I laid in my bed the whole night in cold sweat, feeling really warm under my blankets but also cold af because of my a/c, afraid to move, thinking that there's someone there. I tested to see if it was my toes that brushed against them but there's no way they reached the fan. Laying there, I concluded that there's someone hiding behind my mirror and just laid anxiously till I dozed off for like 30 minutes before I woke up again in cold sweat and just laid there for the rest of the night until the sun came up. You get the drift. I get spooked really easily and just can't go back to bed.When I do sleep, most of the time, I've really bad nightmares or if not that extent, unpleasant dreams. Something that reoccurs is someone breaking in, me escaping through my window and getting chased down the corridor of my apartment complex, playing catch/hide&seek with the intruder.These days, with the TV trick, I'm less anxious while trying to fall asleep but I still can't sleep for more than 3-4 hours, so I try napping in 4 hour intervals twice a day instead. But, of course, that failed too. I've been running on 3 hours of sleep each day. The last time I slept was 24 hours ago, and I only slept for 2.5 hours. I think I got used to pushing myself when I was deprived of sleep. Like I'm used to the constant feeling of being tired. I don't feel sleepy, just exhausted. Like that sluggish feeling you get when you yawn? That's how I feel 24/7. I'm about to maybe order some melatonin or try meditating+yoga to relax.Do any of you experience paranoia induced insomnia too? What helped?&#x200B;More info here.. I'm going to keep this information about my paranoia under a spoiler because I'm not sure if it's relevant.>! I don't know when this paranoia started. I've always been afraid of people hurting me. I only started having my own personal space, and my own room starting late last year. I used to room with my mom and always slept with my neck covered by my blanket (I still do), afraid that someone would come slit my throat. I don't know why? The back of my chair used to face the door leading outside and I'd always look behind me to make sure no one would come slit my throat from the back. Like, SO IRRATIONAL but I don't know why. Sometimes when my boyfriend and I have a friendly discussion about a certain topic (not an argument, even if it gets heated, as it's in my nature to debate), I get really fucking paranoid that he's going to kill me in my sleep, that he's angry and I'd hide a boxcutter under my pillow. He's never abusive, by the way. When people cook and hold knives, I'd beg them to put it down while talking to me because I get really anxious. Every time I go down to the kitchen, I always make sure the knife is there and not missing. Idk, is this about knives?.. I always think someone's going to break into my apartment and I live in a really safe country. !<
Signal	(Good ending at the bottom!)I’ve had insomnia and other sleep issues my entire life. Talking in my sleep, nightmares, the works. In my previous relationship, my ex had a relatively normal sleep schedule. The only problem was that he expected me to have the same. Once we got engaged and moved in together, I realized how serious a problem this was. He was okay with me waking him up with my sleep talking and screaming in my sleep...for about 3 months. Then he began to get increasingly frustrated and angry about it. I have terrible anxiety, and I eventually became terrified to sleep. He also snored, which is something I can never sleep through. If I so much as nudged him, he woke up in a rage.My solution was to stop sleeping. If I drifted off at any point, I would jerk awake in a panic. The only time I was comfortable sleeping was between 7 am when he woke up and 9:30 am when he left. He constantly accused me of sleeping all day (I stayed in the bedroom all day because his dog snored and I couldn’t stand the noise.) I would text him every 30-45 minutes to let him know I was awake. Even our couples therapist told him how fucked up his behavior was. I was going days without sleeping, delirious, and felt like a zombie. A worthless one.Thank goodness we broke up. The damage had been done though, and the extended lack of sleep and emotional abuse lead to a psychotic break. It took a while to come back from it.Two years ago I started dating my current boyfriend and love of my life. We are both insomniacs, but on almost the exact same schedule. The other night at 4 am we were laughing about how fucked our sleeping schedules are. We support each other when one is having a bad spell.Insomniacs, surround yourself with people that understand you, instead of judging you. Who support you instead of tearing you down. Don’t be the first guy. Your life will be so much better for it. And much love to all my fellow insomniacs.
NotSignal	Hello!I've always had sleeping problems but I feel like in this lockdown/quarantine situation we're at, my body clock messed up so bad. I am such a worrier and an overthinker. I always worry about my future or sometimes about mundane/petty things and sometimes I make or replay scenarios in my head and be sad about them. Idk I'm just weird like that lol. Anyway, I want to overcome these habits. With that said, any suggestions on other things I can do aside from worrying and overthinking. I've tried reading books and watching movies, it gets boring sometimes. I've also tried working out in the past.PS: Not a fan of sleeping pills. I've tried them but they didn't do much. So only natural things plsThank you
Signal	I couldn't sleep last night. Got about 3 hours of very restless sleep. I have mild akathisia and its acting up tonight so my husband just left the house in the freezing cold to get me benadryl for the akathisia and so I can sleep. I love him. He would do anything to help me sleep better
Signal	Just a vent.I've been having horrible insomnia for the past six months, since the start of it I've been begging my parents for them to take me to the doctor. They didn't for a long time, but a week ago they ended up seeing my self-harm scars and decided I need help.I went to the psychiatrist yesterday and he simply said that it is mostly caused by hormones and that I should go to a psychologist.Look, I know doubting a professional is no good, but the best night of sleep I got this month was 4-5 hours long, and now I haven't slept for the last two days. He could've literally have given me anything, I don't even care about the side effects or the possibility of me building resistance to the medication, I just want to fucking sleep properly for one night or two.I've been trying to sleep for the past three hours without success, I'm tired as fuck and can't breath probably, I just wish I could pass out already.But anyways, I'll go to the psychologist this Monday, I don't think it'll help at all with my sleep, but at least I can work on my anxiety, I guess.Sorry if I sound stupid or ungrateful, I'm just tired.
Signal	I didn’t go to sleep. I probably won’t even go to sleep for a couple hours. I stayed up all night. I’m lonely.
NotSignal	Hey Queens, Can anyone relate? I have quit caffeine in the hopes it will improve my sleep. While I was tapering over the course of 2 weeks, I slept so much and had vivid dreams. It was really amazing. I had been taking mirtazapine (3.25-7.5mg) for sleep but I did not need it at all over that time. I was really excited that this would be my new normal. Unfortunately, since reaching zero caffeine a little over a week ago, my sleep has been terrible. I don't have trouble falling asleep but I wake up multiple times every night, sometimes for hours at a time. Has anyone had a similar experience? If you experienced insomnia when quitting caffeine, did it last a long time or did it improve?
NotSignal	I’ve been sleeping fine these past few nights. However, when I wake up, my eyes feel as if I haven’t slept well. Has anyone else experienced this?
NotSignal	I don’t get it. Same sleeping routine everyday, since 2 am I am unable to fall asleep. It’s been already 2 hours and it feels like nothing helps, counting numbers or deep breathing.My eyes feel tired but my brain just won’t help.I don’t have any medicine.
Signal	I have paradoxical insomnia which means I am literally conscious 24/7 even when I'm "asleep". It's like when your brain is hyperaroused. I've been taking l-theanine and gaba as another girl suggested to me (she's gone through the same thing) and it's helped quite a bit. I don't remember nearly as much throughout the night. This isn't medical advice or anything I just thought I'd post , it might help people going through the same thing.
NotSignal	A year ago, I had a class that ended at 17:00 followed by one that began at 09:00 the next day. Because it took me a while to get home and study and internet (I may have a problem...), I decided the best course of action would be to stay awake until 09:00 and then fall asleep in class. Needless to say, I had multiple times where I was awake for over 24 hours, and my record was 40 hours straight before crashing for 14 hours (I had no choice there). My sleep schedule was so irregular that eventually I was dropped from all of my classes. It has never fully recovered. I sleep at the most random hours, changing every day. I sometimes end up being awake for over 24 hours straight out of obligation to a schedule, and fall asleep when I'm supposed to be doing other stuff at that time. It's almost 06:00 in the morning. It's going to be one of those days again. I don't know if I will ever get a regular sleep schedule ever again, or if I even want one. My sleeping pattern as of lately has turned to micro naps in the day, as if my body has banned me from sleeping at night but I have to do stuff in the day. I run on irregular polyphasic sleep. Definitely not healthy, but I don't know what to do.
NotSignal	Quick question for those of you on Sonata, Ambien, etc. Every time I go to my doctor’s they drug/alcohol test me - is this normal? I drink socially on occasion which they give me crap for, but my appointments are Monday’s and I often have a couple drinks with friends on Saturday. If I’m drunk I don’t take it because I understand there are risks. So I’m annoyed that I’m constantly scolded for having a couple drinks and it’s an extra $30 every appointment plus my copay! I’d really like to find a doctor who would treat me like an adult but maybe I’m being overly sensitive
Signal	(Venting) I’m trying to ween off prescription sleep meds, but I have real bad sleep anxiety and I’m afraid of the side effects that comes with sleep deprivation.
Signal	I’m new to this group, I’m from the UK (it’s currently 4.30am) and ever since we’ve went into lockdown I’ve been struggling to sleep. It seems to be getting worse every night. I feel so unbelievably anxious and exhausted, every time I feel sleepy I try to switch off but I just can’t, my mind won’t let me and I all of a sudden feel really hot which makes me get out of bed! Don’t know how to tackle this... any advice welcome 🥺
Signal	Like, if I get, say, 2 hours sleep at night I’ll always wake up more tired than when I went to sleep, but if I pull an all-nighter, I’ll be tired af, but usually have enough momentum to get me through the day regardless. Is this just a me thing or is it a normal insomnia thing?
NotSignal	It’s a non-prescription drug (you do have to ask for it in our pharmacies in Australia as it’s behind the counter). Just wondering if anyone’s had any luck with it, and whether you feel groggy the next day. Active ingredient: Doxylamine Succinate
NotSignal	I *suppose* I could use a friend to waste time with...It's not often that I seek a friend. People tend to annoy me, and I'm often happier alone.I'm probably going to sleep later tonight; however, that's a long ways off, and I have time to go through some applications to see if someone will be making the cut. Act fast, though, because it's a highly sought after position... Okay, I'm being extremely sarcastic... at least on that last part.I'm not sure what I can promise in the way of friend- ship. It's not that I'm boring. I'm certainly strange and off-kilter—I'm probably not most people's type —but I am not boring by any means. I still wish that I had more to offer, though. I don't really have any- thing special, like a reserved parking spot for you, as "Insomniac Friend of 2020," nor do I have any unique, monogrammed T-shirt or lapel pin to give you... although I do suppose I could order some...Alright, well... The lack of sleep is definitely afflicting me with an increased propensity to express myself through the use of my California-drought-dry humor, my relentless sarcasm, and my unforgivably bad dad jokes... And so, here I digress...Don't forget to include at least personal references when filling out your application. Okay... There's no application. Somebody shut me up. Just say "Hi" or something. For not liking people all too often, I'm surprisingly not all that picky. Most of you make great skinsuits regardless of personality. The last few have been a little tight in the shoulders, though...
Signal	Quarantine (since i stay up late everyday with barely any consequences) had made me forget how frustrating insomnia is. I have an early zoom tomorrow and trying to fall asleep is a battle I never win. I took a 5 mg melatonin an hour ago and have tired to distract and lull myself to sleep with a tv show I love.And yet here I am. It makes me feel like crying how little control I have over sleeping. I hate sleep, this shit’s bs.
NotSignal	Maybe I stupid for thinking taking it for 3-4 days would have no withdrawals, but I stopped taking it cold turkey because it had no effect on me. It’s been a day since and I genuinely feel awful, headaches random rapid heart rate/anxiety, and extreme fatigue. It could be related to other health problems but I just want to rule out withdrawals. Is it possible?
Signal	While granted i have issues getting to sleep, by biggest symptom is staying asleep. I wake up several times throughout the night and I'm exhausted throughout the day. I was recently prescribed trazadone but for whatever reason I'm terrified to take it. I'm worried I'll have some sort of allergic reaction and die in my sleep lolFor those of you on trazadone does it help you stay asleep?
NotSignal	Is it possible for you to inflict a feeling of insomnia without having it? I've never been tested or whatever for insomnia and I don't think I have it but this is kinda weirdI don't remember how long ago it was at this point but at some point I started developing the habit of staying up into the AMs because I believed sleep was boring and a waste of time (which I still do) but now I can't even sleep early if I want toIt always has to be 12 or later or I just feel like I can't sleep. Idk if this habit caused me to feel like this maybe it has something to do with staying up late on my phone or watching videos I don't knowIs it possible to inflict insomnia on yourself or not? Maybe I really do have it and just don't know, but I doubt it honestly.
Signal	For the past 6 months, I’ve been having trouble getting quality sleep and waking up after 3 hours and then having trouble going back to sleep. I’ve tried going to bed and waking up around the same time and limiting screen time but it seems nothing is helping. Melatonin and other supplements don’t seem to work as well. Any advice would be appreciated.
NotSignal	Why the fuck do they always blame the phone? One night I didn't turn on my phone. I LAYED IN BED FOR 3 HOURS AND COULNT SLEEP. AND SHE STILL DOESN'T BELIEVE ME!!!! I go to Bed not because I'm tired, but because I'm bored. Please, please tell me what to do😔. I'm 14 male. Anything, please!
NotSignal	Hi All, First post on this subreddit. Not sure if this is the place to go for something like this and if I am formatting wrong I apologise. Anyway, this is my story:I have a friend (F13 as stated) who as of recently has serious trouble sleeping due to nightmares in which literal demons would remind her of her own figurative demons (Being Fat, Being Ugly, Not being wanted, etc...). She hasn’t slept in 6 days and me and my other friend are very worried. If anyone has any solutions that would be much welcomed.Thank you for your time and sorry if formatting is wrong.
Signal	Hi! I’m just looking for advice re insomnia and pregnancy. I’ve had insomnia now for almost 5 years and really rely on medication in order to sleep. I use zopiclone ( more than I should and I know it’s bad for me etc etc etc but I’ve really tried a bazillion things and it’s the only thing that consistently works). I’m really ready to start trying for a baby for the first time. I would obviously stop using zopiclone for this but just wondering if anyone has been through similar and how you dealt with this. I have such a fear of 9 months ( and more) of not being able to use sleep medication and this is holding me back from trying to have one. Has anyone been through this?
Signal	Ever since the pandemic, I’m not able to work out, i just sit in bed until the sun comes up at 5, then it’s light outside, and there’s no hope for sleep at that point. I’m currently awake at 6am deciding whether or not I should sleep until 4pm, or power through the day. I need help, where do I go? who do I turn to? it’s been weeks since i’ve been able to sleep. I need some advice please. Important thing: I had worse insomnia before, but ever since i’ve been prescribed adderall I sleep better (ik it’s weird, i have adhd so my mind runs) Anyways, if I talk to my doctor about sleeping pills will he take me off of adderall? I really need both because adderall is not the problem but I need a sleeping pill. Melatonin doesn’t work.
Signal	I've suffered from insomniac episodes during my whole life, most of them last months but when I'm lucky they last a few weeks, but that doesn't make each and every one of them so fucking annoying.This time it's mixed with a strong anxious and depressive episode too. I think quarantine is driving me crazy, like everyone else, and my birthday is coming soon so even though I convinced myself that "I don't care about my birthday, birthdays are only another normal day" a few years ago I realized that I actually do care a lot, and this year I wanted to do something fun for the first time but well, things are difficult. Everything has been really stressful lately and I know not sleeping is making my days worse, but as my days get worse it gets harder to sleep too because I'm anxious about everything, and then I get anxious because I'm anxious and I should be relaxing to sleep, and well, I'm sure many of you know the cycle. Luckily today I could sleep like three hours but then I woke up and I haven't been able to fall back asleep. My whole body is sore and I'm so uncomfortable in my bed. I think I'm just going to get up and start doing things because I feel so guilty of losing time being uncomfortable here, not sleeping, and just scrolling mindlessly.
NotSignal	so i am an indian with of course indian parents raised with a different culture. In this culture waking up late is next to a sin—but i might have dspd. I cannot—even if i try my hardest wake up early. Hell i sleep at 11am and wake up by 3-4 pm. Its uncontrollable. I tried everything. (Except pills causing getting checked up here is a taboo...pills even bigger taboo) and its fucking my relationship with my dad. He keeps calling me lazy dumb and stupid. I cant explain him what dspd is. They wont believe it. Today we had an argument when he said he doesnt want lazy dumb kids. Because that hurt me. Dont get me wrong he is an amazing human. Its just idk Indian parents generally lack knowledge about affection. Anyway i dont know how to fix this. I am already suffering with anxiety and depression (which i have no way to cure cause—psychologist = taboo) and for me existing everyday is task and when you hear your dad say he doesnt want you; It makes you feel even more of a loser and failure (especially when your depression makes you feel like that already) Dont know how to fix my sleep schedule. Its unfixable. Just like myself.
Signal	Hello I’ve always struggled to sleep at night and it’s recently gotten much worse so I’ve signed up to an 8 week NHS (I’m in the UK) CTBi course. Week one was just diaries. I’m two days into week two on a 5 hour sleep restriction (2:30am to 7:30am) plan and I genuinely don’t know if I’m going to be able to do it. I am exhausted and so used to napping in the day that this feels like torture/ punishment. I understand the concept and the theory but this seems quite extreme. Has anyone body done this, can anyone offer me any guidance about how you felt and if this gets easier. I’m so close to giving up and having a nap and calling the course off but I don’t want to give up as I really want to learn how to sleep.Thank you!
NotSignal	Apparently, last night was one of those nights that I can't sleep due to the fact that I slept from 5 am to 2 pm the other night. It's already morning and my family wakes up around 9 am. When they find out that I didn't sleep, they'd scold me and directly assume that I've been using the phone the entire night.Little do they know that I'm always tossing left to right, trying to drift off until its 4 am. Its a fortune if i get some sleep.The fact that I share the same bed with my mom and my 3 other siblings who moves a lot in their sleep is one of the reasons why I can't drift off easily. My spot on the edge is also starting to hurt my back and being on lockdown doesn't help with my mental state either.Would've been nice to be quarantined with a room I can sleep in alone.
NotSignal	I have been trying to change my sleeping pattern for the past few months and i have noticed the reason why i don't want to wake up early its cuz i don't have a morning routine (am homeschooled) and i choose when i feel like waking up. I want to wake up early so that i can have a nice longer day and to be able to study more cuz i have my AS level exam in 3 months.Ant TIPS plzzz.....
NotSignal	June 2019 I had an ABI and I was sleeping fine until September 2019 when my sleeping pattern became a total disaster. Around this time my girlfriend broke up with me and it had a pretty strong emotional impact on me paired with trying to heal through the brain injury. I don’t know if it was the determining factor but it’s the only thing that has changed since September. The last seven months I have only been sleeping 2 hours at a time every single night, it’s like clock work I will wake up exactly 2 hours from falling asleep which means I wake up 4 - 5 times every night. I had a sleep study which found no cause to my arousal issues and my doctors chalked it up to my ABI and never gave me a valid way to help the situation. I have had a rough and slow recovery and I believe a lot of the reason for that is my poor sleeping habits. I’ve tried all kinds of natural supplementation and sleep aids, exercising, staying up late to exhaust my self and trying to fix my sleep cycles, and no matter how tired I am I will wake up 2 hours later. I have never had sleep issues my entire life until this, and I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever sleep normally again. I would like to note that even though I sleep poorly I hardly feel tired throughout my day. My brain gets exhausted due to my brain injury when I push my cognitive abilities but I never really feel tired as a result of sleep deprivation. Any help would be much appreciated!
NotSignal	So I slept at 11pm and woke up at 2:40am and I fell back asleep and woke up at 4:20am then I fell asleep and woke up somewhere at 5 or 6 (didnt check the time) then my final awakening at 8:01
Signal	My sleep is so bad, but the weird thing is I’m not tired my brain is just to active to sleep.
Signal	TL;DR: Awful insomnia x 2 years. Tried everything in the book including multiple medications and doctors. Went full on Keto last week and I'm sleeping >8 hours uninterrupted and can pass out before midnight no problem.\--------Hi all,I wanted to post this about my journey so far. I've been able to sleep FLAWLESSLY the past 8 days. It is still early but I am ecstatic.My insomnia came out of nowhere in November 2018. I started a new job that was much lower stress with regular hours. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't nap, maybe every 2 days I would get a 2 hour nap that would hold me through. I just stayed up all night trying to sleep, moving from the bed to the couch, then watch TV, read, do sudoku, bang out some items for work since I'd be dead the next day etc. Nothing helped. It has been a rough 2 years that caused a lot of emotional strain in my relationship, career and now in grad school.**Things I've tried that did not help my insomnia:**\-benadryl, doxylamine (Zquil), melatonin, sleepy time Tea's with chamomile, ashwagonda, magnesium, glycine, multivitamin, activated B vitamins (B12, Folic acid, B6 (P5P), B2).\-Saw my primary - tried Trazodone, ambien, Lexapro, Paxil\-Saw a psychiatrist - tried welbutrin, then low dose adderall (I have some underlying ADD-inattentive) Both meds worsened by insomnia since they are both stimulants\-Saw a functional medicine doctor - all vitamins checked and specialty labs checked, went gluten free and dairy free, whole food based diet with no take out (for approx. 5 weeks I stuck to this diet). No improvement in mood, brain function and most importantly sleep.\-I developed a meditation routine following r/TheMindIlluminated. I got up to doing 45 minute sits daily and continued for 2 months. I love meditation now, it has an amazing impact on my mood and focus but did not help me sleep.\-I went to a therapist. Paid out of pocket per session for 10 weeks. It was beneficial for some aspects of my life but unfortunately did not help my insomnia.\-Followed a sleep routine to the T with: no screens, exercise early in the day, dimmed lights in the evening and used candles, read books, did not stay in bed, etc etc etc. This did not help.**Things that helped me get some sleep:**\-Xanax 0.5mg or higher\-Cannabis - said F it and drove to a dispensary in the next state over after approx. 3 months of not sleeping and using xanax. This is the only way I've been able to get some form of sleep. I had not smoked for approximately 2 years prior to the onset of my insomnia.**Currently:**I have to stop smoking for work and school so decided it is finally time to kick it. I went back to using Xanax but found that 0.5mg was not working so started taking 0.75mg-1mg doses. Needless to say this is not good long term solution. Not to mention the grogginess and mild depression that Xanax gives me.If you haven't been on the r/zerocarb and r/keto communities I would urge you to check out some of the benefits these people are reporting - improved sleep, skin, depression, anxiety, autoimmune conditions, GI health etc. I understand these are radical diets but for me I knew it was time. I was desperate and willing to do anything.Last week I went all in on the Keto diet (<20gm/day of carbohydrates from all sources). My sleep has been INCREDIBLE. I've been able to sleep with only taking a 3mg melatonin that now makes me feel like a sack of bricks when I hit my mattress. I had to work this past weekend and was able to fall asleep at 10:30pm for a 6:15am alarm. Normally setting an alarm for an early rise would cause some internal anxiety and really worsen my insomnia. That anxiety over falling asleep, the feeling of being stimulated for no reason, the inability to get comfortable in bed is GONE.I am dozing off on the freaking couch at 10pm and it feels AMAZING! Keep pushing guys and gals. Please let me know if I can help.
Signal	I’ve been having ongoing sleep issues for a while and now it feels like no matter how hard I try to be optimistic my default mind state is pessimistic and I can’t seem to overcome it. I’m wondering if other people are having this same issue? I can’t tell if it’s due to lack of sleep or life circumstances.
Signal	I can't do this anymore, it's been 2 years and the stress is unbearable. Makes me want to drop out of school and just die in a ditch. I have finals starting from tomorrow, how will I even get any sleep? All my work gone to drain. I hate my stupid brain and dumbass anxiety. Fuck this.
NotSignal	I'm only 15 I have insomnia I was talking to my mom about how it might come I'm handy when I get into college and I won't be able to get mutch sleep any thoughts on it?
Signal	Last few days I'm very worried and afraid. Just now started crying all of a sudden which I normally never do .Long story short, since 3 days I'm having a very difficult time falling asleep. I barely sleep at all at night (at most 1 hour) and am just awake and afraid that I cannot fall asleep. Twice I fell asleep around 8-9am only and woke up somewhere between 1-3pm. It probably started because of my anxiety in combination of the irregular shifts I have with work. For anxiety I already have therapy btw.Right now I just don't know what to do and am afraid of not sleeping again... Being with my girlfriend or family would help a lot I think, but that's not an option since I live in portugal atm and they live in the Netherlands and Russia. I'll go there as soon as the borders open, but so far don't know when that's possible. Now I'm just feeling so isolated and afraid , afraid of not being able to sleep, afraid of being alone during this and don't know what to do. If anyone has any tips for me or how to cope better with it please let me know.
NotSignal	I’m on week 2 of cbt-I with a sleep therapist. And I’ve been seeing mild results but there are still days I can’t sleep. Can’t I get some success stories, and how many weeks it took to solve this. Also I woke up really late today, and I’m wondering if a day of waking up 1-2 hours late effects the sleep restriction.
NotSignal	The worse I sleep the harder it is for me to nap/fall asleep, but the better I sleep the easier it is for me to nap/fall asleep, who else has this problem?
Signal	I have been awake since 2 and it’s now 4:19. I can usually go to sleep but I cannot stay asleep. I also randomly woke up a little after midnight but only remember checking the time so I know I wasn’t awake long. Tonight’s latest awakening was caused by my forgetting to turn on the fan and white noise machine because an airplane was flying somewhere near my house (which is more than 15 miles away from the airport). I may be able to fall asleep again for 1-2 hours. But does not matter. Today is going to be hell. This is not as bad as some of you here I know. I’m off caffeine and melatonin gives me crazy dreams. I am not sure what else to do I don’t want to go on any hard core Rx. Just saying hi to anyone else awake right now for the past 2+ hours 👋
NotSignal	i’m a 19 year old girl and i feel like i have the fucking jaw of a 3000 year old mummy. i cant even eat or kiss my boyfriend without it cracking or popping loud as fuck. and i always wake up with a horribly sore jaw. my bf has even told me my grinding has been so loud its woken him up from his sleep and he has to literally slap me to get me to stophopefully ill be getting a night guard soon but damn its just another reason holding me back from falling asleep.
NotSignal	I know it seems like a simple question but I'm looking for inspiration since I'm having trouble sleeping lately. And I also notice my mind panics when I can't fall asleep after a certain time. Like I dread morning coming and I'm "failing" at giving my body something essential it needs.Just looking for other people to share their experiences so I can feel better and gain some perspective.
NotSignal	When do you stop trying to sleep and just admit that you’re gonna go through a whole day without any rest? For me it’s about 4:30, cause then I start getting anxious that I won’t wake up on time.
Signal	I was just put on mitrazpine to help anxiety and sleep and it didn’t help. I’ve tried benzos before and ambien which worked but I’m unsure if it can be prescribed under 18. Thanks for any suggestions!
Signal	Hey guys, long time lurker here.Not a bragging post, but just wanted to let you know that with proper commitment your sleep can improve. Obviously it varies from person to person, and the underlying cause of insomnia probably comes in to play.A little backstory:My insomnia started back in uni in my 4th year. I would rarely get over 3 hours of sleep, and often non at all. I don't really remember much from the time, but it was a tough period due to a lot of stress combined with bad sleep, drinking and anxiety (the regular-schmegular) After lurking here for quite some time I know that many of you struggle a lot more than I used to, however I want to share what helped me. First of all getting a job and having set routines in my life forced me to make changes. This meant having to wake up at the same time each day. I did however struggle a lot early and was a zombie for a long time, so by all means it is tough.I try to exercise regularly, which I also believe helps a lot combined with eating decently healthy food.Meditation for whenever I get overwhelmed and struggle with my sleep (I still get episodes of anxiety due to sleep, but a lot less frequent).But the biggest factor of all is DON'T BRING YOUR PHONE TO BED. Leave it somewhere else or use it to play some whitenoise. I cannot stress this enough. Use your bed only for sleep, and if your having a hard time falling asleep get out of bed and do something else until you try again.I know all of this are classic tips that you all have heard before, and you are probably sick of hearing of this. However, it does work with enough commitment.I hope this post may help someone realize that it doesn't have to be like this forever. I feared for a long time my sleep would fuck up my health for good and this was something I had to live with for the rest of my life. I might have periods of bad sleep in the future, but at least now I have the tools to combat it.Good luck to you all. <3
Signal	Should i pop another 0.5mg Xanax an hour after my first dose of it since it didn't make me feel anything? Why do I feel off tonight but can normally sleep fine?
NotSignal	I just thought I'd search for this sub, and I did. Thinking I was the only one with 24-40 hour awake-periods, at least I found some company. As many of you know, this problem can be a real life-ruiner. I can't count the number of times I had to work all day with zero sleep—it's torture.Long ago (decades), a friend sold me a bottle of barbiturates. Boy did that do the trick. I didn't abuse them; I just took one when I couldn't sleep. Of course, those are impossible to get any physician to prescribe because they're "too much fun."Asked my GP (also a couple decades ago) what he can give me to sleep, and he gave me a bunch of crap which just made me feel weird, not sleepy. I've tried every over-the-counter/homeopathic bullshit remedy, and of course, nothing puts a dent in it.
Signal	So for the past few months or so I’ve struggled a lot with falling asleep cause my mind is just racing. It’s like worrying that if I don’t fall asleep right that instant I won’t get enough sleep or I won’t be able to fall asleep at all (I’ve had nights where I stayed up to 6am cause I couldn’t). I get hot flashes with my anxiety (not just sleep anxiety) so that makes it even harder to sleep. I usually dab right before sleep and that helps to slow my mind down but if I wake up it’s really hard to get back to sleep. For example last night went to sleep around 2am, woke up at 7 and had some fragmented sleep after said fuck it and got up at 8 and I’ve been tired all day. Any ideas on how to combat this?Side note I also believe I may have sleep apnea because I snore pretty loudly but only on my back. Plan on getting that checked out at some point
NotSignal	Everything went during the last weeks.And i found out how i have to deal with anxiety.But right now, everything comes back and i belief that i will never sleep again.I just hatw myself for fucking up.I mean i'm able to calm myself down. But i can't sleep.I'm afraid.
NotSignal	This is a sick joke. I only get in bed when I am feeling like Im about to collapse, but then suddenly TADA, my mind gets a fucking big rush of energy, while my body can barely move. My quality of life has been reduced to its lowest form and the worst thing is knowing I am a victim of my own screwed useless brain.
NotSignal	Anyone try Beta Blockers for those who can't fall asleep do to sleep Anxiety? I did read for some it can make some insomnia worse. Thanks for reading.
NotSignal	I need to start work at 9am so there's no point in sleeping now. I think most of my sleepless nights come from terrible terrible sleep hygiene, honestly. I've never been diagnosed with insomnia (but I'm not sure where else to post this) but since I was unemployed and in and out of jobs for about 2 years when I turned 18, I Always had trouble keeping a good sleep cycle. Even now that I have a job it's difficult to stay on track.But sometimes it's as if I can't bare to be just left alone in silence, in bed with just my thoughts. I feel as though I've come to need constant distraction and just can't turn my brain off. Otherwise I'll be left thinking about things I don't want to. Like worrying about the meeting I have this morning and the work I couldn't finish last week. Or wondering about that thing I said or just about the future in general. Will I get my work done? Will my grades in university be good? Will I disappoint my colleagues? Will I waste another evening on video games and TV shows when I promised myself I'd study?I don't know what to do with myself anymore and being stuck working from home has only made this worse. Sorry as this is just a big wall of complaints. I just don't know what to do with myself right now and writing down my thoughts and sending them out into the internet for all to see is kind of cathartic to me.
Signal	for the past couple of weeks my sleep schedule has been terrible, however two days ago i was able to sleep at 12am and wake up at 8am, later in the day i fell asleep at 11pm and woke up in the middle of the night at 1am and kept my eyes shut for an hour and couldn’t go back to sleep, i have no slept since then, it’s been 27 hours and i do not feel sleepy at all, what is wrong ??
Signal	How is it that anxiety, insomnia, depression, etc. just destroy you to a point where you don't even wanna go on. This insomnia has been insanely horrific more so than previous times. I became suddenly impotent but I had a morning wood so I believe it's not really physical but i still can't get any reaction from it. I barely sleep or have half-awake naps 30-50min each until I have a weird rem sleep for an hour wake up then nothing. I couldn't even sleep last night and every time i get tired my adrenaline kicks in making me fatigued but not sleepy. I practiced meditation, sleep hygiene, exercises all that. Never has any of it actually worked. Only thing that made me sleep was an eventual crash and I would try to do the others things to help with it . But this recent insomnia with how it has affected me like never before I give up. If It's not SFI and just my body/mind being a wreck than I'm really gonna seek professional help with the root causes of my insomnia etc. Which Is anxiety/depression I don't think coping with anxiety especially using self taught cbt guidelines are cutting it and might need actual medical intervention. Has anybody really attacked the root causes of their insomnias?
NotSignal	I currently work rotating shifts, one is 7 am to 2 pm and the other is 4:30 pm to 12:30 am. I struggle with insomnia for both shifts, but particularly after the evening shift. I find it so hard to relax and “come down” after work (as my job is pretty stressful). My mind races and continuously thinks about all the things that happened during my shift and what went wrong etc.I often only end up sleeping for a few hours, and it’s driving me crazy. Any advice??
Signal	Hi,I’ve been experiencing insomnia for 11 years. I have taken clonazepam for almost 8 years creating an addiction as I had to take more and more each time. I tried all different kind of pills, from softer and natural to purely chemical. Nowadays,I have been taking quetiapine (25 gr) every night and sometimes I don’t even sleep. I’ve also done sleep hygiene and everything according to the rules. Therapy for more than 15 years. However, something that has been helping so far is this breathing technique: inspire 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds and exhale for 8 seconds. My heartbeats decrease dramatically and it help me focus. I would recommend doing it for 2 mins at least. I don’t fall asleep straight away but it’s some progress.
NotSignal	Let’s hope tonight’s a good night to actually get some sleep it’s almost 9pm the sun hasn’t even set and I’m exhausted, you would think that would set the tone but we will see. It’s always half and half. I think I’m working my way up the insomnia ladder cause it gets worse and worse. The good thing though is if I do get sleep tomorrow will be a great day, I’ll be super productive and feel super grateful to just feel great which always happens after a rough night and obviously rougher day prior.
NotSignal	So I've been dealing with insomnia going on 6 weeks now. For the first week or 2 I could fall asleep easily but always woke up early. Now I generally toss and turn in bed til I fall asleep but then also wake up early. Rarely though I can fall asleep easy but wake up early. My legs and other parts of my body start shaking or trembling and then I'm definitely up. When I do lay there and try to go back to sleep I try and think of something that calms me but nothing calms me. Once I'm up there is no laying back down. I can't sit still and am up just walking around. Trying to sit lasts like a minute before I'm up again. It feels like I'm in some loop that's built to screw me over.
NotSignal	If there is anything that has worked for you to get more sleep please share it
NotSignal	I cannot sleep lately and am so bummed again. initially vitamin D seemed to be helping me sleep but now I feel like it's making it worse. I know it accumulates in blood over time because it's fat soluble but I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Added K2 and my anxiety is at all time low so I'm happy about that but I'm cutting vitamin D for now because I've seen a few anecdotal reports that it causes insomnia. &#x200B;What are your experiences with it?
NotSignal	I have sleep apnea, so my quality of sleep is already poor. I recently got a CPAP, and it helps when I can find a comfortable position with it and when I don't have sinus problems. Otherwise, it's difficult to wear. However, I recently got an oura ring, and apparently I only get 5-6 hours of sleep a night. When I wore Fitbit a few months ago, it was 7-8 hours. I did some research on both Fitbit and Oura sleep detection accuracy and overall, it looks like sleep trackers aren't accurate, only polysomnograms are. (Which I've had before because that's what diagnosed the sleep apnea). I don't think I would have been diagnosed with insomnia then because who can sleep well hooked up to fifty wires unless you only got 2 hours of sleep (because gaming) the night before like I did?I do have mental health issues as well (anxiety, depression, binge eating), and since the pandemic, it's only been worse. Maybe that has something to do with it. I wonder if I should do CBT for sleep.
NotSignal	I've been researching a bit and there has been cases where people don't sleep for years but it is believed that when they lay down for hours it allows their body to heal and then when they are awake they subconsciously sleep which allows their brain to repair itself along with mediation. I have semi bad sleeping habits also so was just wondering if anybody else has looked into this and found it pretty interesting how some people can do it.
Signal	I have chronic insomnia. It started when I was a teenager. Trouble falling asleep as well as waking up every 2-3 hours at night. I've been on and off medication ever since. When I start a new medication, everything is great for awhile...until I build up a tolerance. I've been on Lunesta, Trazadone, and Ambien, all with the same results.I'm currently only on anti-depressants, no sleep medication, and I'm waking up every 2-3 hours at night. I'm basically taking naps every few hours throughout the day and night to get enough sleep in, and it's just so frustrating. I need so much time to get the sleep normal folks get in 8 hours at night, and I'm never fully rested. I know I need to see a doctor or try something new, but I'm between jobs, so have no health insurance. Just looking for reassurance or empathy from someone who's been through or is going through the same thing. I look at the statistics for chronic insomniacs (lower life expectancy, lower immune response, etc.), and I get really down. I want to live a long, healthy life, but it's starting to feel like this issue will never be resolved.
Signal	It’s been several weeks since this started. I’m exhausted at night but everytime I lie down I get this huge amount of nausea that makes me have to get up. Most nights I pull all-nighters and I’m so tired. I just don’t know what’s wrongㅁ
Signal	For the first 3 months of 2019 I had chronic insomnia. No matter what I did (exercising, diets, etc.) nothing helped it. I had become so severely introverted due to some things that were happening around me, the stress of not doing anything or socialising destroyed sleeping. Then the nightmares started.I thought I was much better. Slowly but surely getting 6 hours, then 7 hours, then 8 (never consecutively but I was grateful for what I had). But with self isolating, I havent slept in 3 days, and if I had fallen asleep, I wake up crying nightmares constantly.Does anyone have any advice? Is anyone else dealing with flare ups due the stress of doing nothing?
NotSignal	I think I'm starting to get a bit better sleep. I even wonder I'd sleep most of the night. But I keep dealing with pain now that wakes me up at 3am. At that point I'm just awake. This isn't really for advice, just a rant. Unless you feel like you have tips to deal with something like this.
Signal	Every one says we need to sleep. I think this a bunch of crap, and the only reason not sleeping affects me is because of the fear I feel when people say it is bad to not sleep. Yes after a few days of bad or zero sleep I get double vision, paranoid (mainly because of I need to sleep right?), fatigue, depressed, and frustrated. However when I actually do sleep , I get very awesome lucid dreams and wake up to find only about 2 hours had passed since I went to bed. I feel as if my body/brain is different from others and I enter dream like/ deep sleep right away and wake up feeling totally refreshed even if I only slept a few hours.This sleep insomnia seems to come and go randomly my whole life. I will have awesome sleep for months and then horrible sleep for months.I have found the best thing for sleep is benzos but this comes at a horrible cost when you run out. Seizures, ZERO sleep, and extreme paranoia. So it is better to just not use them at all.What seems to work the best? Very long cardio exercise when I wake up in the morning. At least 5 miles per day running and followed by exercising my brain to exhaustion. Like open your algebra book and just start doing problems until you feel stupid and push the book away and want to cry because you are too stupid to understand ( however sometimes this back fires as I may continue thinking about the problem and results in insomnia ) but I do find if I sleep after studying -- I have a much easier time solving the difficult problem.I have yet to find many people or anyone that suffers from insomnia as I do.I have had insomnia since I was a young kid and always slept in one position: on my stomach, face to the left and arms down.If I try to sleep on my back, side, or any other position it is super difficult -- almost impossible.Counting sheep, images, meditation, nothing seems to work for me. My sleep schedule, using the computer or watching tv seems to have no direct influence on my sleep. If my brain wants to sleep it just does it. Ask any normal person how to sleep -- they will be like, "just close your eyes, and that's it. LMAORecently, I got hit by a car and broke my ankle and a few other bones. Like I am in PAIN 24/7 for a week now (opiates kind of get rid of the pain but make me want to watch tv and enjoy my self). Shit, I bet it would be easier to fall a sleep getting a tattoo. To make it even worse I HAVE to sleep on my back now, my least favorite position. I have managed a few hours since the accident and the dreams I had were amazing. I feel as if the dreams were so awesome as my brain was trying to figure out a way to distract me from the pain.I think I have heard the term microsleep? Maybe I am sleeping for a few minutes, seconds, on and off and it adds up over time... and I just don't realize it?But the point is that I think people freak out over sleep too much. If you are like me and can't sleep then just don't worry about it, your body will sleep when it wants to.I find the best thing is to just lay there and fight for your sleep. I mean laying there and not moving must be at least some rest. Don't worry. My freaking bones hurt and wish I could sleep. FML.Anyways, I am going to try to sleep again.Good night.
NotSignal	I’m offering a limited number of free twenty minute coaching calls. And since I am seeing so many individuals suffering insomnia during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, I have decided to offer a free lesson on a quick and easy technique called *Centering The Storm*.
Signal	I usually wake up between 2 and 4am but it's like I'm half asleep for 30 minutes before I realize that I'm not actually sleeping and wake up. It feels awful, as the dream I'm having is usually a replication of something I was doing the day before.
Signal	Currently taking 200mgs of seroquel for insomnia and it's not really helping, I have to keep increasing the dose but even then I dont find a significant change from increasing by 50mgs?? Does anyone else have this problem?
NotSignal	Besides being crank and all that, I’ve come to find from what others have told me that I have a droopy sad/long look on my face and can’t keep my eyes fully open
NotSignal	It’s currently 2:39 am and I’m in an uncomfortable hotel bed with no sleep. Insomnia is acting up again. What are some things y’all do for entertainment when you can’t sleep and you don’t have access to things at home?
NotSignal	Alright i’ve just about had enough of this shit. Last night I hardly slept at all and tonight i was sure would be me chance to get a good 8 hours sleep but NOOOOOO it’s 3am and my brain can’t stop being terrified over random shit and it’s nearly impossible to sleep. Anyone have any advice?
Signal	Bros, this shit difficult. Here’s everything I use to sleep (I usually use my prescription paired with two or more of these options):-CBD pills -CBD oil/THC pen-dabs, lol -flower (weed)-prescribed Benzos-fuck ton of melatonin (u can’t overdose! But don’t take my word for it, google that shit)-stress less tea-hot bath or shower-your last hope: Benadryl ( Not too much be careful!)
Signal	So, yesterday I completely fucked up my sleep schedule. I got into one of those funks where I couldn’t sleep and ended up staying awake until around 8 in the morning. Then, I crashed and didn’t wake up until 6 PM. Now, since I have to be up at 6 AM every weekday for school, I thought I was fucked. But, after popping a 5mg pill of melatonin, I was able to fall asleep around 10:30 pm, and now I’m up. After having some caffeine this morning, I don’t even feel any drowsiness. I know it’s not the best solution, but it really helped me today.
Signal	Y’know that moment when you’re tired asf but sleep won’t come to you cause of overwhelming stress and constant existential crisises and constant thought bombarding you keeping your mind as active as your heart would be on three red bulls keeping you awake ‘till at least four am?Just me?Okay.
NotSignal	I can only speak for myself, but I would like to share my experience of how I fixed my insomnia. I hope this will help you guys in some way.The biggest difference that made me sleep all night was Fasting. I start eating at 12pm to 9pm (you can pick any time, as long as your eating window is 10 to 8 hours only in the day)At 8:30pm I make sure I have a big carb + Protein meal. Chicken curry is a good one, and let that sit until 11pm when I go to bed. At 10pm I go to a room that is not my bedroom, put on battery powered red led light just enough light to read a book. I read "Jeremy Clackson" . It's funny and it doesn't matter if I lose my place. I also have a notepad and pen to write down my thoughts of what's bothering me at the time. Put everything down, you want your head empty so you can put all your thought in to reading that book, and not have it wondering. Also make sure you're having at least 200g of broccoli or sprouts in your diet. Veg help you sleep.If I wake up in the middle of the night I go back to the red led light room and start reading and writing. If I need help to relax. I will take a big dose of CBD to make me sleepy and not a small dose because that can wake you up.But hey, that's how I tackled my insomnia and I just hope this will help you poor people who are suffering this awful thing. I have had it for just over a year and it's been on and off. But again, for me this worked. I hope it will work for you guys.
Signal	Hi everyone,I tend to go to bed around midnight and my body wakes me up every time at 6.15 AM. If I didn't get full 8 hours of sleep, I wake up extremely irrational and irritable. I cannot go back to sleep. I do feel awake and I feel like I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. I have to get up and do things, even if I didn't get the full amount of sleep. And I feel very agitated.For example, if I can't find something after waking up, I might trash the entire house looking for it, flipping drawers, and think that's OK at that time. And then two hours later I will look back and regret my crazy behavior after waking up.Now the thing is, I just don't know how to fix this. I'm aware before going to sleep that I need to be chill in the morning, but it just doesn't work that way.I'm in a relationship and I don't want to dump this morning behavior on my partner.Any help or suggestions?
NotSignal	I miss dreaming. It used to be technicolor and surround sound. Everyone dreams even if they don’t remember in the morning. It’s been 10 years of this shit and I want to dream again. I want to wake up and say “hm. That was super cool”. Now I think “ugh bedtime. No dreams. Just necessary to sleep so suck it up. Be an adult. GGGGRRRDRRRDRRR
NotSignal	No point in even trying anymore, just causes too much psychological stress and deliberating anxiety. Been trying so hard not to take anything but I just can't so this anymore fuck
NotSignal	It’s been 3 days, but I’m still wide awake. I just want to sleep.
NotSignal	I’m thinking of avoiding sleep meds and trying to regulate my sleep cycle while in quarantine. Has anyone else started trying this?
Signal	Recently my insomnia has gotten a lot better and I’ve been able to fall asleep fairly quickly most nights (despite the fact that I usually sleep around 3am, I find it an accomplishment that I can fall asleep at all). I think it’s just because I wasn’t really doing anything so I had the ability to fully relax and there was no pressure to fall asleep at a certain time and wake up early. But ever since I’ve started going to work again, my insomnia has started to flare up because I was getting used to sleeping around 2am-3am. So now that I can’t really do that, my brain is constantly putting pressure on myself to fall asleep early so I can get x amount of hours to function normally tomorrow. But instead, I end up barely sleeping more than 2 hours, and if I do, it’s in a weird state where I don’t even feel like I’m sleeping. I do take melatonin but it never really works when I have something to do the next day. Does anyone have any tips about how to basically relax the brain and slow down your heart rate before bed due to the anxiety of not being able to fall asleep?
Signal	Ehhh not sure if I’m posting in the right place but looking for the best Guided sleep meditation/hypnosis audio 🙏🙏 I’m getting immune to the ones I am used to listening to and my Xanax doesn’t seem to want to work tonight😣
NotSignal	At the moment I get sleepy at around 10am and- if I let myself- could sleep to 6pm. It got really bad because of a heatwave last week, but I've been struggling with a weird sleeping schedule/ no sleep at all for a while- but this bad is new. I'm happy I'm able to sleep at all, but I have 6 exams coming up and this is not helping at all. I can't take any additional medication because of other health issues, other than that I try to exercise. I've tried smelling lavender oil too- but the placebo doesn't work for me. I tried to not sleep until a normal bed time a couple of times- but then I don't sleep at all. Also splitting the sleep (like taking a 3 hour nap and then hoping I'll be tired at night) did not work. Honestly I'm getting a bit desperate.Anyone have any more ideas?
NotSignal	Often when I have trouble sleeping, I’d be lying in bed with my eyes closed but my mind would be having the most random thoughts ever such as narrating a story, having a song play in my head, the most random insignificant memory like reliving high school, and other weird things that aren’t realistic (can’t remember right now but an example would be like grabbing a book then it starts flying) When I try to have my mind go blank and think about nothing so I can sleep, it doesn’t work. Why do I have these weird, random thoughts in my mind that jump from one thing to another thing?
NotSignal	Never have i ever been able to sleep the whole night Never have i ever been able to sleep for more than 3 hours for more than 2 days in a rowNever have i ever really enjoyed the little periods that i fell asleep in, is that some sort of paranoia?Im only young
Signal	I’m starting to think my vape addicting might a leading problem to my insomnia. I used to get pretty good sleep before I did that. Also what’s the max melatonin you’ve had? I think mine was around a 100mg and then I got worried if you can overdose then gave up on it.
Signal	So I was diagnosed with insomnia and my doctor said it was also my bipolar disorder keeping me wide awake. I take sleep meds that help me sleep at night even though i literally NEVER feel sleepy or tired. My body is wide awake, and if I do feel even a teeny bit sleepy its like for maybe a few minutes then i snap back and I feel like I slept great even if I didnt. I once forgot my sleep meds when I slept out at a friend's house and despite literally not sleeping at all and was up for 36 ours I was WIDE awake. I feel like I could run a 100 miles. I could sleep at 11 and get up at 7 and be wide awake. sleep at 4 am and get up at 11 am and be wide awake. i could sleep at 5 am and get up at 7 am and be wide awake. it does not matter how much sleep i get. and i have seen my psychiatrist time and time again and adjusted my bipolar meds os many times and literally nothing changes. people think 'oh youre never tired thats great' but its a DIFFERENT kind of wide awake. Its like a 'ive been awake my entire life and never slept ever and im running on fumes at this point' kind of wide awake. its NOT a good feeling at all.
Signal	I have insomnia that kicks in at the middle of the night, when I wake up and can't fall back asleep. (I'm able to sleep in the beginning of the night just fine). I went to a clinic and the nurse practitioner recommended me melatonin and Benadryl for a month. I told her that I had read about the study that linked it to dementia, and she gave me some technical terms about comorbidity and that the report only tested seniors who likely had other issues contributing to their problems, which led to them taking Benadryl in the first place. So I'm going to try it for a very short-term (I'm not sure if I even want to do it for more than a couple of weeks).What do people here think? Is it safe?
NotSignal	Every single night I have trouble falling asleep, last night I got sleepy at 3 AM and went to bed, but I just couldn't sleep. I just closed my eyes and didn't even notice that time had gone by, when I opend my eyes, I can see that the room os brighter because of the sunlight. Then I just started panicking, 'cause I would have to wake up soon. Got no sleep and I would have an event at 9 AM. When my alarm rang, I thought "no way. I am not getting up right now". I decided to try to get at least half an hour of sleep. So I put another alarm for 30 minutes later and simply sleep. I slept like a baby! Woke up right now (still sleepy of course) and I just gave up going to the event I had so I can sleep. That already happend to me lots of times, I used to think I am just afraid of the dark and that's why I can sleep only in the morning. Now I guess during night I'm so worried about getting some sleep that I just can't at all. But when the morning comes I think "well, I'll try to sleep a little before work (or whatever I have to do in the morning), after all I have nothing to lose. I can have no sleep or ALMOST no sleep."It freaks me out. Right now I'm on vacation, so I don't really have to get up early. But what do I do when my classes start? How to deal with zero hours of sleep when you got things to do during day?
NotSignal	How long did you guys need to beat insomnia episodes? I'm 1.5 months in and it's not really getting any better..
NotSignal	Hey everyone. I was wondering if anyone here has tried any online sleep therapies such as Sleepio or myShuti. If you have, can you provide your insight on them and which one would you recommend?I have been in a horrible struggle with insomnia for 7 years now. I have tried almost every doctor in my availability, but nothing seems to work. Doing some research, recently, I found out that restricting your sleep schedule can drastically improve your insomnia. I set out to try it for a couple of weeks and miraculously experienced some improvements. My wish is to continue with this habit, and it is my belief that I will have a stronger inclination to adhere to it if there was a someone or something I could keep track with. I discovered that these online sleep therapies are heavily geared towards helping you have a set sleep schedule. Thus, I am interested if this finally could be the key to curing my insomnia.
Signal	I've been struggling with sleep for about a year. I've been on temazepam, zopiclone, ambien, risperidone, and quetiapine.I had some success on seroquel and zopiclone. But I gained a ton of weight on seroquel and I was sleep walking on zopiclone.Yes I've tried melatonin but no help.Someone please please help me sleep. I'm getting desperate.
NotSignal	Im afraid im not getting enough oxygen when breathing and it keeps me awake. What should i do? Congested even with decongestant. Breathe9ng through mouth doesnt make enough pressure to vent co2 away from face and i will get hypoxia at nohjt is my fear. 3 days of no sleep. I'm panicking. I take benzo and remeron
Signal	Hello everyone so my dad has been suffering from sleep deprivation for as long as I can remember so 20 years or more. I’ve noticed it’s making him age rapidly, so I’m on here asking what’s the best over the counter treatment for insomnia. Thank you
Signal	When I’m alone, sleeping is basically a chore and I’ll be up for hours or days before I eventually pass out from exhaustion. Or I’ll barely get 2-3 hours of sleep. However, if I have a friend staying over. I pass out moderately easy majority of the time. Same thing applies when I’m on vacation with family or friends and we’re sharing a hotel room, Im usually the first one asleep. Maybe because they’re asleep too and I don’t want to be a bother to them. Recently I’ve had a friend staying over for the past two weeks but not in the same room and I’m sleep pretty late but I stay asleep. And last fall of Nov 2019 through mid January 2020 I had friends staying over for awhile and some nights I had trouble sleeping but not always.Why is it by myself I struggle to sleep but when others are around it’s not hard.
Signal	I've had trouble sleeping since I was young. I would constantly stay up till 5 am when I was 8. It was so easy for me to keep awake because of the constant thoughts running through my head. One second I'll be in my bed then the next sitting on the coach in front of the TV. Over the years it's been on and off again where I
NotSignal	So I’m an insomniac and I get really lonely cuz none of my other friends are. So if you wanna chat 100% ok with that. It’s like 12 am here so yeaah. I have school tm or technically today. But yeah. Hope we can chat
NotSignal	I saw a post on here a few days ago that said squeezing a stress ball for a bit before bed helped OP sleep, so I decided to try it. And I *think*.... It helped...? Today is a birthday of someone I lost, so I'm surprised I got any sleep at all. I think I was able to fall asleep a little faster though, but I'm still tired. I will try it again tonight and maybe it will help. Fellow insomniacs give it a shot! If you don't have a stress ball you can probably make one.
Signal	I tried going to sleep around 11pm last night (1/16/20) after having been up the day before (1/15/20) from like 4am, I woke up around 3am which was to be expected and basically stayed up watching YouTube and Netflix until like 45 mins ago when I finally got tired and tried sleeping. I had some ASMR in which helped for a little but I essentially woke up like 20mins and ofc tried going to sleep again but for some reason I felt like anxious or as if I was dying? My body was super heavy and like my brain felt frazzled or something idk how to fully describe it, but it was fucking scary. I’m gonna try sleeping again but if this happens again idk wtf I’m gonna do. If this sounds like a garbled mess, it’s because ofc over the collective week I’ve probably slept less than 24 solid hours?
NotSignal	Accepting your insomnia is when you get out of the bed you've been in for the past 5 hours to do something productive at 3am since you're not falling asleep tonight.Do any of us still kid ourselves that we might get a wink of sleep? Is it even worthwhile to stay in bed after we're still awake 2 hours in?
Signal	Then when people suggest trying melatonin or CBD or meditation or any other obvious thing and preach about "good sleep hygiene" I just have no words to describe it. I always feel like being, "Wow, gee thanks for the helpful advice! My life will be forever changed! I've never ever heard of that before!" in the most sarcastic voice possible.
Signal	Due to the quarantine in my city my insomnia has come for me and I can’t sleep properly anymore. I hate everything and want to die a little.
Signal	When I was younger I had horrible, horrible SA. When I finally made it to college, I felt so happy for the first time in a long time. I loved college, and did really well. I had a really active social life, got good grades, did research, orgs, etc. Very little social anxiety, good mental health overall.I also slept really well, every single night.My natural sleep cycle is from 2 am-10 am. I always got a solid 8 hrs of sleep. Ok. I graduated in December and this yr has been awful. I’ve been depressed, work hasn’t been great, I don’t feel like I fit in, and feel really socially anxious there. I was trying to put my finger on what it was, and then I realized: I have been sleeping realllllly poorly since January when I started, because I have to wake up at 7. At first I didn’t sleep at all, now I sleep but I toss and turn a lot. I don’t sleep well at all. I think the social anxiety is because my brain feels foggy and unfocused from not sleeping. I can’t think of anything to say in conversations and sometimes do dumb stuff because I’m so sleepy. So I don’t initiate any conversations, and I’m pretty sure my coworkers think I’m too reserved/aloof :/ I’m generally a pretty outgoing, confident person but I’m like the opposite of myself rn. Anyway, I’m going to see a therapist soon so hopefully that helps, but damn. Not sleeping well sucks. and I honestly didn’t realize that that was probably a huge factor in my SA as a kid. I thought there was something horribly wrong w me but if I’d just slept better I’d probably of been wayyyy less socially anxious.
NotSignal	This might be the stupidest thing to ask, but what do you guys do when you can’t sleep, I’m up until 6am everyday and it really sucks and I can’t just watch tv or I go insane, is there anything that you guys do that helps or even better helps you sleep lol?
NotSignal	Has anyone ever have similar experience? I have taken ambien as needed for some months now maybe 1-2 times a month with success, but last night it was weird it didn't put me to sleep i was conscious yet i was half dreaming and aware but in the morning median rested. The only other time i felt so was when i ate too much of marijuana edibles.
NotSignal	After years of fighting the thought of taking CBD to beat insomnia, I finally bought my first CBD product. Will update this post with results (if I see any).
NotSignal	Hi, I've had insomnia literally my whole life lol I've never not had it. A few years ago I became pretty severely chronically ill. I haven't been able to get a diagnosis from anyone. But for about a year now I've been on a medication that also acts as a sleeping pill & I've had a big reduction in symptoms. So my question is, are there any other chronically ill insomniacs here? I'm really curious to see if there's any evidence that insomnia can cause chronic illness. Like basically I'm starting to worry my body exhausted itself into oblivion lmao.
Signal	I google the half life for this drug and it says up to nine hours only. Pretty weak right?But after not taking it for a long time, I took 50mg friday night. And I felt the effects all weekend. Even sunday night right now I still feel pretty shitty. Im very very lightweight and very unhealthy in other ways so could that be a factor of how benadryl affects me as well?Anyone feel the same about this drug?
Signal	My insomnia had been increasingly bad since lockdown until recently I’d been taking Dramamine for my nausea and realised how easily I fall asleep after it because of the drowsy side effects. But now I’ve been struggling even more without taking it but I really don’t want to become reliant on it. Should I go cold turkey and stop taking it?
NotSignal	idk wtf is going on but i had a disturbing dream, and i’m even more upset bc i was able to sleep a bit early tonight (12am) but then it had to be ruined by an irritating dream. please help :(
Signal	Hi guys I’ve been having really bad insomnia ever since the coronavirus hit. Not that the isolation drives me anxious or anything but it basically gave me freedom of time. My sleep time had progressively gotten worse sleeping from 4-5 and waking up 2-3 in the first few days because of work and now 6-7 waking up at 4. Moreover it is often initially very uncomfortable when I sleep since I have a really sensitive nose that gets blocked easily from temperatures my body is most comfortable in (can’t sleep if too hot, can’t breathe if too cold). I predominantly use my mouth to sleep which gets all dried up and smelly when I’m up and find that it is very tiresome; it’s just very hard to ignore it as it’s not natural and comfortable. During the initial stages of sleep I also feel that my mind is constantly generating new conversations that I feel lasts for hours or at least unbearably long which is the part I hate the most. I also eat dinner sized meal snacks at midnight since I only get 2 meals a day. This causes me to piss a lot during midnight and when I sleep. What can I do?Also please refer me to any other subs since I’m desperate for feedback. I do not take caffeine or anything but it’s worth noting that I workout at night and it’s pretty hardcore.
NotSignal	How does one hour make such a huge difference??? I didn't fall asleep till midnight, and then I slept through all six of my alarms. Again.I know that's small potatoes compared to how poorly some of you guys sleep, but man. Time changes really mess me up.
Signal	It all started this summer,I keep struggling with sleep since then and I really hate it. I don't want to take any medication because I know I will be addicted to them so all I do is see those calming youtube videos,but they rarely help. I sleep only 3-4 hours per night and I am full of saddness and anxiety even though I always tell myself let it be. Please someone tell me this will be fixed soon and how,cuz I am feeling really bad.
NotSignal	Well boys, we did.Pulled an all-nighter and I’ll probably crash sometime during the day. Wish me luck.Best part of this adventure was when my alarm clock went off and I magically became tired
Signal	It’s 4am I’m tossing and turning since 1 am but have felt sleepy since 10:30 pm . I took 3mg of melatonin at sunset (8 pm)Valerian root (2 pills)Zopiclone 11 mg and also half of 5.0% alchoolic drink from 11:20 pm to midnight. NOTHING WORKS it’s my 3rd sleepless night in two weeks. Before that it would happen maybe once or twice per month. I just want to cure my insomnia already. I was not even anxious until now? What should I do?
Signal	I try to get in bed by 9:00 and I usually don’t get to sleep until like 10:30 or 11 because it takes that long to calm my mind down and get to sleepI’m afraid of going to bed later will only make me go to bed later in the night making it more challenging to sleep and making me more anxiousIt feels like I wake up (even when I get up early) that days go by so fast that it’s already nighttime (which I’m dreading of another battle to get to sleep) and the cycle begins every single fucking dayIt’s making me severely depressed and making me wish I could just die because insomnia took ahold of me at a random time in my life and just crushed the joy out of itI’ve posted something similar to this but you guys understand how lonely sleep issues can feel sometimes
Signal	Most of us are big league insomniacs, but I've seen this repeatedly suggested a sleep aid. I've encountered anecdotal evidence from people whos opinions I trust. However, I found if I take it (500mg-2g) I do, in fact, get extremely drowsy and relaxed but I don't actually fall asleep. I'm not tossing or turning, my mind is quiet and peaceful, but it'll be 2am and the process of sleep engaging simply will not occur.I've since moved beyond it but I'm curious if anyone has any experience with it.
NotSignal	Severe insomniac here, I was able to get to bed by 2 to 3 am for some time but as of recently I have been waking up at like 8pm and going to bed at 8 or 9 am. What do you think about staying up for 18-24 hours to fix sleep schedule?
Signal	I decided to seek a psychiatrist after encouragement from my therapist and one of the things I was told to address was my insomnia. They absolutely dismissed everything I said. When I brought up how I just lay there all night and can’t sleep due to my thoughts being so loud she told me it couldn’t be possible and that I’d eventually pass out. I even told her that wasn’t the case because I’ve stayed up 3+ days with no sleep before and didn’t pass out. She then tried to tell me that I’m not sleeping because I enjoy it? But I absolutely do not. It makes me feel like shit to not sleep. She then told me that people of my “body type” usually develop sleep apnea due to their weight and THAT must be what I’m experiencing! Even though I can’t get to sleep in the first place being my main issue!No meds or help for me! Must be my weight.. Not. I told her this has been happening since before I put on weight but nope! Guess she knows my experience better than me?? UGH.
Signal	I’ve not been able to fall asleep for the past two months until 4 or 6 am which leads me to missing classes, losing income from school (Swedish thing) due to missing classes and just overall feel of guilt and disappointment. I called up my therapist who got me on Zopiclone 5mg a while back when my sleep was at it’s worst. I had that for a week and slept alright for a while after I was off them. Now that my sleep was so fucked again I gave them a call and they said they’d get back to me. 6 or 7 weeks later they say they are booking a time for me to see them before the prescribe anything. I was desperate for sleep and managed to get some Zopiclone 7.5mg and first night I slept well but it didn’t really help as much as it did back then. Then the day after I sat up for 3 hours after taking it still not being able to sleep I was ready to just breakdown. It’s now the third night and I’m on a 7.5mg pill not feeling anything and it’s 4 am. I have a test in 6 hours so we’ll see if I can pull trough it even wake up in time. Not gonna take anymore until I’ve spoken to them but what the fuck do I even tell them? “Hey I know these really strict and hard to get prescribed pills I got last time helped but tried them last week and didn’t really do it for me now” do I just accept them and then call 2 days later and say they did nothing?.. eh I’be just been losing my mind and getting so stressed over the funding, my grades and my mental health in general over these last two months of bearly sleeping.
NotSignal	I've had insomnia as long as i can remember. Now i'm 21 and its getting worse. I remember moste of my dreams. When i was a kid i was so scared. I had to have my room so dark that i couldn't imagin seen monsters next to my bed. After year of nightmears every night i was exhausted and i began to just lay dead in my dreams. Its been a while but i had this dream. It was so intense and i still remember the pain. If you have ever seen the movie "the cloverfield paradox". It a scene where someone gets their arm "eaten" by the metal. In my dream the metal is moving slowly moving up my body. A pain i never felt before. And when i woke up. I couldn't go back to sleep because i felt it hours after i had woken up. Enoyone had a similar experience?
Signal	I am literally in a anxiety attack and crying and hyperventilating because I can’t sleep but at same time I don’t wanna go to sleep due to my fear. I took my trazodone already.and I’m so scared. I was trying to talk to one of my friends but no one is answering. I don’t know if I can take my panic meds after I took trazodone. Please help sorry if this seems all over the place
Signal	I’ll try to make this short. I can go to sleep at night without any problems. The hard part is staying asleep throughout the night. I wake up maybe an average of 3 times a night but i can go back to sleep usually with no problem. But there are times when i wake up so much tht i still feel tired the next day. My bed is comfortable, i don’t drink alcohol or coffee and i dont smoke. So i am just curious.Also i have sleep paralysis a lot. I have it at least 4 times a month, sometimes every day for weeks. But i have always had this problem since i was in the 3rd grade and now i just graduated High school last year. One last thing, when i have my sleep paralysis it keeps me from going back to sleep. So i might go to sleep at 12 and wake up at 6 paralyzed which wont let me go back to sleep because i will wake up 5 minutes later paralyzed again.
NotSignal	Stopped by Taco Bell only to remember they slashed a lot of their menus. Fuck you Taco Bell, I just want full stomach and a full night's sleep! Gotta work in 5 hours, going to try to catch some zzz's again.
NotSignal	I am trying to sleep for 3 hours can't fall asleep
Signal	i have this thing where every so often (like once a week or every other week at least) i’ll end up staying up for two days straight, to be fair i’ll take a nap for a couple hours and then i’m back up. i’ll have boughts of tiredness but then even during the second day of little to no sleep i’ll be fully awake and functioning as normal. just a couple weeks ago i took a 4 hour roadtrip (i wasnt driving tho) and skated for 2 miles all on the second day of staying awake, and i was completely fine and energized as normal. i even was the last of my friends to pass out for the night. i dont really have good sleeping habits, im a total night owl and usually fall asleep anywhere from 3am to 8am depending on how im feeling. when i was a toddler i would have extremely vivid dreams and sleepwalk nearly every night, but it ended after one very memorable nightmare where i woke up screaming at a wall. in middle school my mom took me to a sleep study and the doctors told me i woke out of rem sleep a total of 19 times in the night. and just recently in college while at the dorms i wouldnt be able to fall asleep for hours upon hours as my thoughts kept racing. so i guess i’ve always had a strange relationship with sleepi find that often these boughts of insomnia start as attempts to fix my schedule. i’ll tell myself that if i pull an all nighter one day then i’ll be tired enough to sleep at a reasonable time, yet it always turns into another day of no sleep. i dont know what to do or how to fix this, def not sleeping pills but i truly have no idea.
Signal	Hi, I have an insomnia problem. The last two moons happen to me that in every week one day I can't sleep at night at all. I'm up until, like, 3.4 in the morning. Before I go to bed, I drink tea for sleep, I don't look at the phone, I'm at peace and yet I can't sleep. The next day I just lie down with zero energy. What about it?
Signal	What can i do not to fall asleep when I actually need to be awake? Currently i’m feeling fully awake but I’m not sure how that’s gonna turn out, usually i always fall asleep when i have shit to do.My errands start in about 9 hours, it’s currently 5am. I have a feeling i won’t be able to do anything then.
Signal	So I've had issues with insomnia for years now. I get sleep but a lot of the time I don't get any. This is ok when you are at home and if you get no sleep you can just seclude yourself the next day. But what do you know a sleepless night has hit me while I'm at my sisters house with friends over. So I'm currently the only one awake trying to be as quiet as possible walking around the flat. It's now 6am and I have to say, seeing the sunset at this time at someone else's place is kind of surreal. Guess I should probably sleep but I have no way to sleep without my adhd going wild and hyperfixating on everything. But yeah just thought I'd post this on here cause it's 6am and I was bored, wish me the best of luck for tomorrow socialising and all!
NotSignal	Hi, maybe reading this will be confusing. My brain is just melting right now, sorry.Sometime ago I was having these weird hypnic jerks which would wake me up just as I was drifting into sleep, I soon discovered they were caused by stress.Because of this I got a little scared of going to sleep, but this fear went away after some while.But now, for some reason, whenever I'm even slightly tired, I'll just have the strongest symptoms of anxiety ever.Like, I've been having some serious strong headaches which prevent me from getting out of bed. I also get really dizzy and weak (I'm actually struggling to hold my phone properly RN).I'm not sure if I'm unconsciously anxious because of my experience with insomnia, but I'll assume that's what's happening.This is actually leaving me kinda paranoid, and I've been wondering if I've really been sleeping at all. The thing is, my mother also has these anxiety related symptoms. Actually, the only reason as to why I call this anxiety is because she told me so, I've never been to a doctor. Thinking about seeing one though, living like this is hell. And I'm only 14, like, isn't that kind of early to be feeling shit like this?Idk, I will go to sleep right now, it only gets worse I actually feel like I'm dying Haha.Goodnight you guys, I hope y'all can figure out stuff idk.
Signal	I messed up my sleep schedule on summer vacation bc I forced myself to stay up till 5am to play games w friends. I’ve been trying to fix it now for 2 weeks. I can easily fall asleep but I’m having trouble staying asleep and I keep waking up every 1-3 hours. Today, I woke up 3 times and only got 5 hours of sleep.Should I do something or just be patient? I’m also taking melatonin
Signal	No drugs, medication, or anything just straight sleep. I haven’t slept like that in weeks. I’m hoping this is my first step to sleeping normally again!
Signal	Just took my first dose of trazodone tonight. I really hope this works because I just wanna sleep. I usually get 1-4 hours per night and i hate it. This is usually due to chronic pain but not always.

Signal	Ugh it seems even if I do sleep 6 hours somehow I'm still so sleepy all day , yet my body doesnt wanna sleep at night. Also I can never gets my legs comfortable??
Signal	Hi guys..To make a long story short. I have always been a happy person in general sometimes a bit of anxiety here and there but nothing major that'll make me question reality.I'm an active weed smoker and have been since the age of 17 I'm now 26 years old.Since the lockdown began i started noticing a few symptoms which at first got me a bit worried but not a lot. Out of nowhere i started feeling weak, fatigued and started to feel internal tremors like vibrations inside my body that i couldn't see but i could feel them, it started to worry me a bit because i thought it was probably coronavirus symptoms.My anxiety started to flare up but i could still go on about my day without any major problems.The internal tremors started to keep me up at night so the gp prescribed me Promethazine 25mg to be taken once before bed. It worked i slept like a baby for the next two weeks. Everything started to feel normal again and i was happy.Fast foward 1 month later and i started to have sleeping problems like waking up in the middle of the night. I told my gp and he prescribed me 25mg again for another week.This time is didn't work i was still up during the night and started to feel as if i wasn't able to fall asleep anymore now before any of this started 1 zoot was enough to KO me for the night but now it was different not only was i not able to sleep but my mind would race with a lot of thoughts about everything.I couldn't sleep i felt like i was going insane, music that i has heard earlier in the day would just continue playing in my head in a loop throughout the night.I contacted my gp again he prescribed me with zopiclone 3.5mg and on the first night it KOd me but not on the second night i was still finding it hard to go to sleep (bare in mind that i keep fit and go swimming and gym whenever i can).Phoned the gp and this time he prescribed me Diazepam 10mg man the anxiety disappeared but i still wasn't able to sleep by this time i had probably slept 7 hours the whole week.Called my gp again this time he prescribed me with setraline 50mg and boy that's when the suicidal thoughts and depression came, i immediately stopped taking them after only 3 days.Called my gp again, he prescribed me with melatonin 2mg again this didn't work at all.I was about to give up on life and was thinking of ways to put an end to my missery because a lack of sleep meant that i wasn't thinking properly and i wasn't enjoying the things i normally do.I cried like a baby that whole week.Called the gp again this time he prescribed me with mirtazapine and boy did i sleep like a baby on the first night on 15mg.The next day i tried it again and slept finally but i was still waking up during the night but i could still fall back to sleep something i couldn't do before.I'm still struggling to sleep without waking up 4 or 5 times during the night. My mood is slightly improving but now I'm a bit irritable with my loved ones.I have tried everything even stopped smoking weed for a week with no success. I just want my old life back where i could sleep without any medication.I've had blood tests done and everything seems fine the doctor said I'm a healthy young man.Please if someone is going through any depression and anxiety just remember that there is a solution to every you just have to keep looking and never let your thoughts control your life.God loves us all.
Signal	So, basically I have never been able to control my sleep cycle. Even when I was a kid (m21).I was able to sleep properly when I was a kidI used to used at noon)and when I was at high school because I was studying during the night.After high school I started staying up an all nighter and I can’t control it at all anymore.Rozerem and ambien saved my life for 10 months. I felt alive again, but I got addicted to it. So I stopped. After the rebound insomnia I still can’t sleep properly. I sleep 4 hours the day before yesterday, 8 yesterday and today I need to wake in 6 hours.I dunno what to do about my life anymore. My doctor ignored I was getting addicted and prescribed ambien again. (The same dosage tho).I haven’t been taking it for 1 week. I can’t take this anymore. I don’t care if I need sleeping pills or anything. I just wanna be able to sleep properly. Somehow. I went to bed 1 hour and a half ago and failed to sleep again.I was thinking...maybe I should ask the doctor to change my medicine periodically. But I’m not a doctor. I dunno if that works. Is it safe or healthy? Even doing for a long period of time? Or even “forever”Also, I don’t take medicine since last week. How much time does the detox take? I was wondering if my body still resists ambien. I even thought about taking only rozerem.Thanks in advance.
NotSignal	I've never experienced insomnia before, but this past month I haven't slept more than 4 hours each night. Obviously this is bad for my health, but how bad? Long term damage? It seems my body is adjusting and I don't feel like shit anymore. Last night I didn't sleep at all. Am I fucked?
Signal	was previously on 7.5mg zopiclone for 6 months but “quietly, eventually”(also am an alcoholic so i only took zops when i wasn’t drinking which is 2 times? a week?) dosed myself up to 22.5mg because of tolerance (also been on lorazepam for the past year and a half). is it weird to have some kinda tolerance to quatiapine? after the given circumstances?
NotSignal	It’s 4:00 am I still can’t sleep, I don’t feel tired but I know I would enjoy sleeping if I could. Also there are some really loud birds outside my window for the past four hours. Is there anyway for me to sleep?-sincerely a 16 who can’t see a therapist because their too scared to asked their parents
Signal	Hey fellow sleepless/sleepy strangers! I've had pretty bad insomnia for the past 3-5 years, generally for months at a time. One weird thing that happened sometimes was that I wouldn't be able to fall asleep, my mind would be racing with my internal monologue. But it's like I stopped paying attention to the thoughts themselves, I would be in this trance laying down with my eyes closed. But not asleep, or at least not dreaming. Then I would "come to" and realize I'd been in a trance/still ruminating or thinking. Very strange.Has anyone else experienced this? I would feel half-rested after nights like these. Not as bad as no sleep at all, but definitely still bleary and not totally myself.
NotSignal	I'll make this as short as possible, one year ago my bf and I went out drinking. I brought him home since i was the most sober, took him to bed and went to the bathroom, changed and went to sleep. So apparently I woke up a couple of hours later and went to sleep in his roommates bed. Now I have no recollection of how I got there, I only remember waking up and being mortified his roommate is 70, married. I left as soon as possible and went back to my room. His son had filmed me walking around the house, now his wife thinks I had an affair with her husband. However this night I hadn't blacked out and it happened after I fell asleep. My boyfriend has caught me sleep walking before, 3 different times, one just going into the bathroom and staring at the mirror for half and hour. Walking him up and telling him we would miss. our train of he didn't get up. Standing in front of our room and hitting my head against the door. As well as not being able to sleep for days and sleep for 2 days straight.All of those I dont remember, having full on conversations with my parents & so on. I dont know what I can do, we are indian and that generation doesnt believe in sleepwalking. I am not trying to blame anyone else for my actions but for the love of **** I dont remember how I got there. & I dont know what I can do
NotSignal	1. Do take a warm bath before bedtime.2. Quit alcohol especially before bedtime3. Keep your afternoon naps under 30 mins if you do sleep at that time4. Make a habit of READING during bedtime. This helps a lot
NotSignal	I hope I’ve described it well in my title and is relatable to someone, or someone knows what this is. This seems to happen when I’m stressed and happened worst while I was in collage, yet seems to have come back. So last night I didn’t have great sleep, so tried to fall back asleep this morning. I kept drifting into what I believe was a sleep state, no dreaming but I could hear what was happening outside my dream (kids playing etc). I also have the sensation of my face being dragged downwards, my ears rumble and there is a tension at the back of my head, like a muscle inside my head is cramping. Anyone else get this? Or any idea what it is?
NotSignal	I just laid in bed for 8 hours without sleeping at all. I toss and turn, throw the blankets off of me and back on again. I close my eyes and they open again. What freaks me out the most is when my internal monologue starts to overlay and I can hear my voice talking about 4 or 5 things at once. I’ve done a sleep study before and my doctor said nothing was wrong with me physically but I know something is wrong.
NotSignal	What started out as a dull headache has turned to full nausea. I've been drinking water to suppress the nausea and took Tylenol for my head, I'm currently lying down fully awake. No more nausea or headache though.
NotSignal	So for years and years I’ve never been great at sleeping, always been a night owl and can’t sleep until I am truly knackered. Over the past year I’ve had this issue where if I sleep early (midnight or so) I only sleep for two hours. It’s only if I push through the tiredness and stay awake until say 3 am that I can sleep for 7 hours straight. I don’t like forcing myself to stay awake but it’s the only way to stop myself only getting two hours sleep. I’ve tried a lot of different things to stop this but nothing’s helped long term, hoping some members here could provide some help?
NotSignal	i’ve been struggling with insomnia for awhile now (trouble sleeping as a child, as i got older would stay up restless, became clinically worse in high school post trauma and even worse pretty recently) thinking of going to therapy for a couple things was considering telling them I believe I have insomnia or severe sleeping problems and have been considering medication for a long time. any advice on what works? side effects? any advice in general?
NotSignal	So right before a big exam or interview i can't sleep. Anyone have trouble with this if so how did you get over it?
NotSignal	Most of the information I see about sleep studies focuses on sleep apnea. Can sleep studies help insomnia when apnea is definitely not indicated? It's there anything one could find out about us via sleep study? of course my main concern is I cannot sleep in my own damn bed, how would I ever ever sleep with a sleep study. But they say that they're quite used to that issue.
Signal	I've had trouble going to sleep for a long time now, but only a few days ago I decided to give melatonin a try. I took it for 2-3 days and was able to go to sleep without staring at the dark ceiling for forever. After trying out melatonin, I decided to see what would happen if I didn't take it anymore and tried to go to sleep. It was extremely hard to go to sleep and I would feel as if stress is swallowing me up and the thoughts inside my head would be racing even faster than before. I eventually fell asleep but after 45 minutes to an hour I woke up to what felt like shortness of breath. I felt anxious, stressed, and as if I should be doing something instead of sleeping, even if I was really tired. After two minutes or so, the feeling would go away, and I would try sleeping again and would fall asleep but the same thing would happen. Just wondering if someone has felt something similar and what potential ways I could fix this?
Signal	I actually haven’t had a sleepless night like this in awhile. All started with my anxiety and now here I am, 5:43am, literally have tried everything and my eyes still won’t shut.
Signal	I feel so nauseous and have a horrible headache. Ever since I haven’t been sleeping that much my mental health has gone down the drain, ive had suicidal thoughts and I’m just so fucking tired. I don’t know if this depression is real or if I’m just tired. Before when I was sleeping better I wasn’t like this, it seems like over the past week or so I’ve gotten horrible. I’m crying all of the time and I can’t sleep or focus.
Signal	I go to sleep around 9:30-11pm everynight. Typically at night I take a 1mg dose of lorazepam for panic attacks. I wake up anywhere from 2am-3:30am everymorning and cannot sleep until 6-7am when the sun comes up. There is no reason i can think of why this is happening. my room stays a comfortable temperature and i dont have a problem being in the dark. I dont wake up because I have to use the bathroom or too hot/cold. Im not up with anxiety either. I just physically cant sleep. I will lay here for hours with my eyes closed but I cant reach sleep at all. I have major recurring depressive disorder, ocd, and panic disorder but none of these things are whats keeping me up (i mean maybe the depression but im not in a depressive episode when its happening) I was frustrated and crying everynight when its happened but now its just everynight so I am just calmly awake and trying to figure it out. Ive been on trazodone in the past and had a horrible reaction to it. Help??
NotSignal	Everytime when I try to sleep I'll only be able to sleep for a few minutes and it feels like hell. Any tips?
NotSignal	Ugh! Anyone else have this problem? So many times last night I felt my body relaxing and ready to drift off to sleep, only to then get excited or tense and make me not go to sleep.This is freaking awful.
Signal	Just wanna vent really. I'm so tired that I honestly thought I'd fall asleep as soon as I got into bed. Last week I moved the TV outta my room to help with sleep. For 3 nights I managed to sleep, no problems! Then I had 1 bad night's sleep a few nights ago and it's set me back to square one, I'm on my 3rd bad night in a row. Now even *thinking* of laying down in bed sets off my anxiety. I stayed out of bed the entire day, and was so excited to fall asleep that getting into bed was the best feeling ever. But I did have a lot of anxiety leading up to my bed time. Then I think I fell asleep for maybe 10 mins, or at least came close to it, then my boyfriend moved and I was wide awake again. Now I've been in and out of bed trying to wait for myself to get tired. I get exhausted to the brink of falling asleep then I get back into bed and get so much freaking anxiety again. Additionally I get anxious because I've been causing sleeping issues for my boyfriend which just adds to my own anxiety cos now I am worrying about his sleep too 🤦‍♀️Really want this nightmare to end.
Signal	Its 3:45am and I have to be up by 6:30am, night after night of little sleep plus the fact Im so tired during the day making my body feel so worn out. Alcohol doesnt work, makes it worst. Is it true being on a cell phone is worst because of the blue light?
Signal	Do you think it's possible to be traumatized by insomnia? I've been suffering from insomnia for years and I feel like I kind of dread bedtime now because I fear it will be another horrid night. In turn I feel this is contributed to the inability to fall asleep. And when I cant fall asleep, I get so angry and become self destructive. I kind of think I've had such a bad experience with sleep that im suffering from some sort of trauma related to the activity of sleep. I dunno. Just some thoughts. Whataya think?
NotSignal	Hello, I have the following problem. For a while now I have noticed that I have trouble falling asleep if I masturbate or have sex for 2 days at a time. One day does not affect my sleep. But as soon as I do it for several days in a row, I lie half asleep all night. Is there a correlation between falling asleep and the amount of ejaculation?I am just 22 by the way.
NotSignal	Does it work? Is it just a myth?If it doesn't work does anybody know any other weird ideas to get to sleep and stay asleep because I am fucking desperate....very very very desperate
NotSignal	I have been lying in bed for the past three hours just thinking about random stuff, not even bad stuff just stuff. It doesn’t seam to matter what I do in the time leading up to bed and I can’t get it to stop. I’ve tried the nap time tea and the valarian root to no avail. Does anyone know a way to get my brain to be quiet long enough for me to fall asleep, I’m on the precipice of trying to find a doctor for this but I really don’t want to.
Signal	Been struggling with severe anxious thoughts at nighttime for a couple of weeks, making it near impossible to sleep, but yesterday i felt like i had a breakthrough. I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep, but instead of thiniing about how i was dying or wouldnt fall asleep, i was just having completely natural thoughts.For the first time in 3 weeks i felt normal, like i would be able to sleep, but all of a sudden something just went click and i started spiraling again and couldnt stop myself. I tried to sleep until about 3 am, and i was kinda lying in that wierd inbetween stage where i was sorta awake but still dreaming, i then gave up and took 3.75 mg zopiclone and got knocked out, but i was really upset that i maybe missed a chance at natural sleep
Signal	I've had bad sleeping habits ever since I had memory, I have a chronic illness that won't let me sleep early, and doesn't let me wake up either. Everyday I take pills for sleeping yet it doesn't work. Besides my dreams aren't nice, usually someone gets lost or dies in them. I won't say they are nightmares since I don't wake up with my heart pounding to the point of hurting like in my worse dreams, but they aren't nice either. I feel sleeping is a waste of time, yet I'm so tired. Wish I could have energies in other ways so my brain stops making this bad stuff while sleeping, but guess I'll have to sleep. Or just be stucked on my phone browsing Reddit. Do you have any tips for good sleeping?I really need them.
NotSignal	Can you have a great physic suffering from insomnia or it stunts your gains very much?
Signal	I've had sleep problems for the past 10 years (sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia) and the degree of suckiness is really variable - I had great sleep for like 4 semesters in college around 2012/2013, I had shitty sleep but then decent sleep when I really got rigid about my sleep hygiene in 2016, and in 2017 and parts of 2018 my sleep was HORRIBAD. Very randomly I'll get AMAZING sleep and feel like I can finally see through the sleep deprivation induced brain fog and depression the next day and it is such a fucking night-and-day game changer you wouldn't even believe it. Sadly this only happens a couple times a year. Mostly it feels like I get like 3-6 hours of sleep a night; like, I'm sleeping, but it's shitty, spotty, poor-quality, feels-like-I'm-sleeping-in-the-gutter-right-outside-NYC-rush-hour-traffic sleep. Here's what I think it boils down to:1. **Mental Illness** \- I'm seeing a psychiatrist right now and he *suspects* I have bipolar disorder but I'm really not sure. At any rate I am WAY, WAY, WAY more sensitive and emotionally labile than the average person and when I'm really wound up/emotional my sleep gets worse accordingly. Also when I used drugs (which obviously didn't help my mental illness) my sleep was worse than it is now (no drugs, not even caffeine). When I came off my antidepressant in 2014 and all sorts of shit went down (including anemia) I literally couldn't fall asleep most nights. I'm taking meds right now and they're helping *a bit* with my sleep. I'm just a super sensitive, high-strung person in general that has very, very light sleep (I sleep with a Manta Sleep Mask, foam ear plugs, and over-ear sound attenuating ear muffs most nights). Meds help with my emotional problems to some degree but we're still figuring stuff out. 2. **Deviated Septum induced sleep apnea** \- I have a crooked nose and my right nostril is significantly smaller than my left nostril. When I lay down at night and notice I'm breathing out of my right nostril I have to break out the nasal strips, Vick's, and prop my torso up to get some air flow going because I immediately resort to mouth breathing when this doesn't happen (when I'm just lying on my back trying to sleep). I'm currently recording my sleep trying to spot apnea episodes on my own because even with insurance sleep studies can be expensive and sometimes your insurance company decides to fuck you over and go back on what they said, etec etc etc etc.3. **THIRSTY THIRSTY THIRSTY DRY MOUTH DRY THROAT** \- So when I'm conscious when I wake up in the middle of the night (still haven't ruled out unconscious awakenings due to apneas or whatever) I am **ALWAYS** and **WITHOUT VARIANCE** thirsty. Or I'm thirsty and I have to take a piss. I keep a water bottle IN MY BED for this expressed reason. I'm on 300mg of lithium (very low dose) so maybe that's the problem but I doubt it because I've had these "water/dry mouth awakenings" before i was on lithium. It could be some type 2 diabetes shit because I do eat a lot and don't often have the energy to exercise (I'm sure my fellow insomniacs can relate). No, I don't eat a lot because I'm a fat ass - I eat a lot because I'm so naturally skinny that if I don't slam down lots of protein and calories every day my hands and wrists start to hurt because they are literally that small and then I end up having trouble at work. **AND YES** I do drink plenty of water during the day as I am a thirsty MF when I'm awake as well. I ALWAYS have my 32oz water bottle on me and fucking GUZZLE on that shit all day long and refill it on average 3 times (\~90oz/day) to the point where one of my work colleagues jokes that I drink too much water and always asks "where's your water?" I get really really thirsty really fast, basically, even during the day time. It's amazing how he can go HOURS without taking a sip of water (he basically only takes in liquids on his breaks) where I am literally gulping down like 8oz worth every 45 minutes or so, and ideally I get some water in me every 20 minutes. I'm just so tired of this shit and feel like I need to A) Keep seeing my psychiatristB) See an ENT so he can look at my deviated septum and maybe get a referral to a sleep study based off of his findings C) Drag my ass to the gym/get on the bike EVERY DAY regardless of how tired I am in order to rule out type 2 diabetes no matter how ridiculous it sounds &#x200B;Anybody have any ideas as to what's going on here? I'm sorry for barfing out this wall of text but that's in part because I'm irritable and sleep deprived (as is the norm). Oh yeah, and just to get it out of the way, I'm doing run-of-the-mill, standard sleep hygiene stuff
Signal	Please excuse me if I ramble or don't make sense I'm trying hard to get myself to focus. It all started a year and a half ago when I (26F) moved to a new country to live with my Fiancée (now husband). I had trouble sleeping due to my anxiety so we got some non addictive sleeping pills that knocked me out easy but a couple months later I'm lucky if I fall asleep 6 hours after I take one.I have a cycle I go though every 2 months. For 2 weeks me just falling asleep becomes harder and harder I tend to not touch electronics after 9 then 10:30 is when I lay down to try to sleep. It will take me longer and longer to fall asleep until I hit around 3 am and wake up around 10am. The next couple weeks is a spike in anexity in my daily life that makes to hard to enter over cluttered or messy places. Then for 3 weeks I have stress dreams and wake up often mixed with dreams of past traumatic moments. Then we hit this God forsaken week were I sleep for less then 3 hours a night until i have 2 good nights of sleep and the cycle repeats.I'm going to leave some factors that might be important. My professionally diagnosed mental things are, Clinical depression, Agoraphobia, Generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. The mattress doesn't support my back well. I'm highly stressed and have constant anexity due to me not being able to have a destress space (tried to set it up when I moved here but my husband didn't take it seriously and decided not to listen to me at all. He takes my anexity and panic seriously now.). I have been meditating before bed for 2months now and have recently started being more active during the day to try and get sleep. Nothing I have done has changed this sleep cycle im in so far. Please I need help I need to have good sleep so I can work on managing my life better. All today I've been reading reddit and leaving comments to stop myself from crying about the fact ive never been able to nap and a nap would just be so nice right now. Tl;Dr F26 so tierd and stressed that I'm crying because I can't nap. Please give me advice for some good sleep.
Signal	You never know if the fear is falling asleep losing control or just the things you read on sleep deprivation that makes you anxious.
Signal	I was recently prescribed trazodone for my insomnia (50mg). Was told to take 1 at bedtime. It’s night five and 2 in the morning wide ass awake. I took the pill around 8:30pm. I’ve already tried doubling the dose and it doesn’t help much either. Like it literally does nothing for me. Zquil (non medicated version of NyQuil) works better than this is. With zquil I’m out in a half hour max. Should I call my doctor and request something different or stick it out? Does it take time to work? I’ve never been on a prescribed sleep aid before.
Signal	I've almost never been an insomniac - it's only the past few months that it's crept in. See - I've moved schools twice, which has made me quite stressed. I've always had bad sleeps because of stress, but never an actual sleep schedule that involves it. I'm hoping that it's a temporary thing. Hearing that teens need 9 hours of sleep isn't exactly great for my anxiety. My schedule has been 3 hours, 8 hours, 6 hours, repeat. It may not sound too bad but my health is rapidly deteriorating and I look awful. Plus - I wake up in the middle of these times, so they're probably not necessarily accurate. I've heard about polyphasic sleep but I definitely don't think that's the direction I should go. Any suggestions?
NotSignal	Side effect of another diagnosis or medication? Stress? Addiction? Grief? Depression? Anxiety? Genetics??I often wonder what the root of my insomnia is, but truthfully I don’t really know. And I think that’s pretty important when it comes to getting help for it. So what’s your culprit?
NotSignal	How is everyone faring with their insomnia during this crisis?
Signal	Back in late May I “overdosed” on a sativa strain weed vape pen and it sent me into a panic attack. I have taken gummies numerous times before for pain and to relax, but I hit to the vape pen on a newly charged battery and took the same amount of puffs as I was on a really low battery and it sent me into a panic attack. Anyways, ever since then I’ve developed a little bit of anxiety and from that I’ve been “diagnosed” with insomnia. My anxiety of other things has almost gone away completely, now I just have anxiety about not being able to sleep, which now I have a super hard time falling asleep. I’ve literally had zero problems with anxiety and/or sleep up until that night. I’ve been on a few medications to help with the anxiety, and one of those was an antidepressant/anxiety/insomnia pill, trazodone. It was a night time pill, and I felt fine during the day, but when I would take it at night my mind would start racing and I would think about and picture the most irrational thoughts and pictures and I couldn’t fall asleep. Like I would think about a blade of grass, and then jump to a bottle cap, and then the edge of a desk and so on. Anyways, I talked to my doctor about getting off of it, and did get off it, and now I seem to feel a little better. However, I still just can’t fall asleep. I’m deadass tired and sleepy, but I physically just cannot fall asleep. I’ve tried over the counter sleep aids, zzzquil, hemp gummies for stress and sleep, melatonin, and now my doctor has me on lunesta. The lunesta works, BUT it just knocks me out and I don’t feel like I get any real restful sleep. I’m super tired the next day, my eyes burn because I’m so tired. But I just can’t fall asleep. It’s so stressed about not sleeping and have become so emotional. Does anyone know what I can do that will get me sleep? I’ve got a little bit of PTSD from the weed pen, but a lot of my friends say medical marijuana is the way to go. Any thoughts or suggestions? I’m desperate for sleep. I tried an Indica gummy with melatonin in it last night, still didn’t get much sleep. To add to this, I had a check up appointment virtual call Monday with my doctor, and he suggested I get in to do a sleep study.
Signal	I'm taking melatonin for about 10 month now, for the first couple of month it worked perfectly but since then it doesn't working (actually it got worse), someone know why? (Sorry for bad english)
NotSignal	Basically, since Friday, I’ve been having a bad “episode” where I’m scared to sleep come bedtime. This happens often, and it’s extremely irritating. Throughout the whole day, I’ll be confident about sleeping, and when I start to feel tired, then I’ll lay down in bed. Then I’ll be afraid of dying in my sleep, or having a bad dream I can’t snap out of. I can’t seem to figure this out, and it’s the strangest phenomenon to me.
NotSignal	I have quite a few things that keep me from sleeping but occasionally my leg jerks and it is annoying. I'll feel a pulling of sorts in my calf and then my leg/knee jerks up. I wrapped an ace bandage around the knee and the upper part of my calf and the sensation wasn't there anymore! The point was to restrict movement to keep it in place. It actually worked! Just wanted to share.
NotSignal	I'm only 15 but I've been having bad sleep over the past year and a half. It takes about 6 hours for me to fall asleep and when I do, I wake up continuously and end up getting less than 5 hours every night.I was hesitant about getting sleeping pills as one of the reasons were that I've read that some people on here have mentioned being dependant on them and quite frankly I'm scared.My doctor recommended me Circadin and tonight is going to be the first time I'm using anything like this. Does anyone have any reviews and experience with Circadin?
NotSignal	My body doesn’t produce enough melatonin so I need to take supplements, but due to corona I can’t get the supplements ( I don’t have any left) .Even I don’t take naps and exercise 1-2 hours I can’t sleep and because I can’t sleep I don’t have energy to exercise ( I try my best to do it). I also have online school like at 8 am and I’m able to fall sleep at 12pm the earliest and another problem is that I don’t have quality sleep, I wake Up in the night.
NotSignal	I purchased 200mg pills and tried one last night 1 hour before bed. It was like I took an adderrall and my heart was racing non stop. Ended up sleeping 3 hours and feel miserable. Everyone online swears by it being a good sleep aid but I’m curious why it had the opposite reaction
Signal	39 hours ago I woke up feeling rested, I had a 3 hour nap and woke up 19 hours ago from that. I can’t sleep, I don’t even feel tired but the second I try to do anything I’m extremely foggy. I’ve had 30mg of melatonin with no effect, I’ve tried sleep music, warm shower, food, slamming my head against a wall, I have no sleep aids and am to delirious to go to the store, when I went to sleep(the one I woke up from 39 hours ago) I was sleeping off a bad high(from weed) it freaked me out so much I trashed the rest of my stash and the insomnia is obviously killing me, please any advice is greatly appreciated
NotSignal	I have difficulty getting to sleep and my sleep cycle fluctuates wildly. So far for sleep I have tried Clonazepam and Lumin without much success with either. I just asked my doctor for Belsomra and am hoping this works.Do any of you have experience using it?
NotSignal	I want to gain mass and strength, currently doing calisthenics with push-pull-legs workouts. My main focus is progressing in weighted chin-ups and dips and gain mass. If I eat well (caloric surplus) and train well, will I make progress and gain mass even if I sleep bad?I don't really have problems with sleeping, but there are times like now that I am weeks sleeping bad, like waking up every 1-2 hours, I can wake up like 6 times in a night, so I don't know if my body can repair my muscle fibers and make progress that way. In normal times I can sleep properly, usually sleep 5-6 hours then waking up for a piss and sleeping again for another 3 hours, that is my perfect sleep schedule
Signal	I’ve taken Ambien, benzo, and Trazadone. Currently on Rozerem for a week now. One hour of sleep last night. Ambien at any dose does very little. And I’m already on a benzo for Vestibular migraine and don’t want any more. I’m going to have to go back to Trazadone (200mg). Anyone have a good experience with Rozerem?I will go without any sleep whatsoever without medication. Although I do suffer from Narcolepsy after 2 or 3 days, and will fall asleep for a few min in weird places.
Signal	Got I feel exhausted. I lied on my bed ALL NIGHT LONG and didn’t get one minute of sleep. So I just gave up.
Signal	Not trazodone or mitazaprine, those are the devil. I'm not looking for a long term solution, just something to get my sleep cycle back into wack and stop me waking up 5am everyday
Signal	I’ve had on and off problems off waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep. I’ve been able to deal with it but recently i’ve been having really bad nausea reaction to drinking coffee(i think it’s the caffeine) so i’m cutting that back. But it’s harder to focus on less sleep now and also i’m very irritable. Anything and everything people do around me annoys me and I know it’s no ones fault so I try to control it but it’s frustrating. Any ideas on how to deal with this?
NotSignal	Should I just say fuck it and get up and miss a night's sleep or should I try for another hour to sleep?
NotSignal	It’s currently 5:25am and I haven’t been able to fall asleep tonight despite my best efforts. Now, the birds are chirping and the sun is rising and it feels like another night with no sleep.How can I possibly fall asleep when it’s light outside?
NotSignal	I've tried keeping my sleeping pattern exactly the same throughout the week. Waking up at 7, going to bed at 11. I've tried not eating any sugar/caffiene at the weekends. I've stopped drinking at the weekends. Even when i'm not working on a Monday (I do the 9-5 grind) I still can't sleep. I've been to see my GP several times and each time he's turned me away saying "it happens to everybody" and that there's nothing he can do / prescribe. I've tried various mild sleeping pills but none of them work all that well. I usually end up sleeping through it and feeling worse in the morning. I thought it might be something to do with how tired i'm feeling so I joined an Icehockey team who practice Sunday nights untill 11, no change. I'm stressed constantly, but that doesn't really affect my sleep during the other 6 nights. I went to bed last night feeling tired, yawning but by 1/2am I was wide awake again. I felt a bit groggy but i'm so used to it now it doesn't really phase me anymore. Last year was horrific for me rightup until the very end (solidified by losing a friend on the 29th) and I want to start off this year on the right path.&#x200B;Has anyone shared the sunday night insomnia / fixed it.
NotSignal	Hello my father(73) has trouble going to sleep for about a week and a half now he slept for 2 hours yesterday but hes starting to have hallucinations is there anything i can do to help him? (Sorry for bad emglish)
NotSignal	This happens often whenever i find a new catchy song. It'll get stuck in my head for the first few days after listening and will make falling asleep hard. no matter what i do, it just keep playing on repeat.Recently this happened the worst it's ever happened to me. I had the whole of Lemon Demon's Spirit Phone album constantly looping in my head for almost a week. Now i've been avoiding listening to it, even though i really wanna. i LOOOOOVE the album so damn much, but i'm scared it'll get stuck again.
NotSignal	I haven’t gotten sleep for 4-5 nights now. Luckily I was able to get three hours last Night. But I don’t really feel tired, or sleepy. Does anyone else feel this way, where you don’t get sleep but don’t feel tired either?
Signal	Hi all! I have sleep problems and mostly struggle with staying asleep. I tend to wake up multiple times a night every night and often for hours on end. I get 4-6 hours of sleep on those nites usually. I might be a tad sleepy once I finally get up but over-all I'm alright and not tired feeling all day. However, when I do have the random night that I actually sleep well, and don't constantly wake up or wake up and be unable to go back to sleep, I find myself feeling exhausted when I finally get up and the feeling can follow me around all day and it's horrible. I like being able to sleep well but I almost prefer to sleep like crap and not feel like death the next day. Does anyone else deal with this? Have you found a solution?
NotSignal	Hello,I just want to share my situation. If you had similar situation please reply to me. Currently, my country is under partial lockdown. Some states are under full lockdown. Meanwhile, the rest are under movement control order. For the states under lockdown, they can't go out at all. Food was given by army. States on restricted movements are allowed to go out but to only buy supplies. There's army and police everywhere in my area.I'm not worried about this. But somehow I've been losing sleep. When I sleep my mind is like so active. I don't know whether I've fallen sleep or not. I have a terrible headache and neck pain. I'm not sure if this is causing my insomnia or my insomnia causing the pain. I've been dealing with insomnia since 2014. It comes and go. Usually when my insomnia is this bad, as in it was happening more than a few days, I would go out and clear my head. Walk. Go to the beach. With this lockdown, I can't go out. I also have MDD and severe psychosis. Feeling trapped like this and losing sleep is not doing good for my mental health as well. I don't know why my mind is so active. I'm not tired at all. I'm sorry if my posting is all over the place. I'm losing it. Thank you for reading. I live in a third world country and English is not my first language. I'm apologise for any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.
Signal	I've never had dark circles until I started having trouble sleeping at the start of this yearI hate it. It makes me so self conscious. I know I can cover it with make up and I do when I go out. But I don't like that I have to or that I look like thisI was just wondering would they go away if I start sleeping better?The past week I've been getting decent sleep like about 7 hours with only waking up once or twice in the nightBefore then it was weeks of 4 hoursHow long would it take to get rid of them?
Signal	Idk why but when I can manage to sleep more than 5 hours I wake up with a terrible headache, istg i feel like I’ll throw up, my head feels like it’ll explode, my eyes hurt wtfff. I thought that if I managed to sleep more than idk 3 hours I’ll feel with more energy..... but no! This terrible headache is way too painful
Signal	Has anyone here tried temazepam for insomnia? It is yet another medication my doctor want me to try. And she ordered an at-home sleep test. Had any one here done one? Thank you guys so much.
NotSignal	And I was damn, that sucks but it's super rare so I probably don't have itBut then I thought but what if I *do* have it?
NotSignal	41-yo male (Texas). The DST change has seriously f'ed up my sleep. I suffer from anxiety that comes out at night, and several other mental issues that, together, make it very hard to fall or stay asleep on a normal night. Then the time change comes (one hour subtracted) and IDK why, but this year has been worse than years past. My sleep dr dropped me last year (his practice changed specialties to do strictly sports medicine for the Dallas Cowboys) and ever since, I've been on OTC medication only. Add a stressful marriage (hanging by a thread) and yup I'm wide awake at 3:15 AM. Have slept around 4 hours total, past three days.
NotSignal	amitriptyline...that is... One of its side effect is it could make ur busts huger or make them squirt water... Now I am an F. I was an E before using this.
NotSignal	Hey all, I'm new here and new to reddit in general. I've never slept well, and this whole current situation has made it worse, so I started a new youtube channel with music and images to help me sleep (images always help me). If you're interested, check it out and maybe it will help you too: bit.ly/calm-insomniac
NotSignal	I am not sure of the name of it but it’s basically a headband with electrodes you stick on your forehead and turn on. I followed directions, it appeared to work. I went to bed around 2am (typical) and woke up around 7 (also typical). I have trouble falling asleep, then when I wake up - no matter what time - I can’t go back. I’ve developed an eye twitch that won’t stop. When I went to the doctor today, it was like her eyes fell out of her head when she went over my results. I only slept 6 percent of the time. I told her I definitely went to sleep and I remember getting up at 7. She read it like 4 times to make sure it was right. I had no idea you could think you are sleeping but you’re not. So now I’m going to a sleep specialist because something is really wrong. It totally explains why I am forever exhausted and I cannot think straight (I can’t do basic math when asked and I majored in math...). Has this happened to anyone on here? I can’t be alone. What could the issue be ?
Signal	My insomnia intensifies whenever I have something really important the next day. I’ve been lying in bed for 6 hours now and I just give up. I have my first 10 hour day of work today, And I was wondering if you guys have any tips to make it through the day? I’m so upset this is happening but it’s happened many times before on many other occasions.
Signal	Curious on if anyone has any luck taking sleep medicating just once or twice per week for extended periods of time. I have mild insomnia where I sleep 4-6 hours much of the time, and even getting two good days of sleep would be good enough. The sedating antidepressants just linger way too much and leave me a zombie for most of the day.
NotSignal	Yesterday she freaked me out on the phone driving back from work. She said she felt like she was hearing things and having hallucinations. She made it home but was acting super weird. We watched a movie and she wasn’t able to sleep again at night. She seemed to be freaking out and having panic attacks. She kept saying hears sirens everytime she closes her eyes. Honestly she’s always struggled with anxiety so it kind of scared me not knowing how to help her. Seemed like she was on the verge of a mental breakdown.I just tried to calm and relax her. As I woke up at 8:00 she was still up but more calm. She eventually fell asleep around 8:30. It’s now 10:20 am and she’s still asleep. How can I help her moving forward? Should I let her sleep in all day today? Luckily she has a day off. Just concerned.. thanks
Signal	This Monday I have my first appointment with a psychologist that deals with sleep issues. I'm excited because all of the therapists I've spoken with about it before don't necessarily get my problem. I have insomnia and somniphobia. In my case I have intense fear of not falling asleep, and I have so much anxiety over it that it really lowers my quality of life. I've been taking Klonoipin since March, so 4 full months. I'm now pregnant and I'd like to come off of it and overcome this fear once and for all. What kinds of questions should I ask? Has anyone had success with a psychologist for insomnia? Or experience with intense fear of insomnia? I'd love to see some comments detailing your experiences. I'm determined to do this and hopefully improve my life!
Signal	Does anyone else get angry on anticholinergics? I feel like the few times my depression lets up is when I'm getting tired, which starts the usual cycle. I've tried almost all of that class of drugs, benedryl, doxylamine, doxepin, hydroxyzine, and it feels like they just keep me from blocking angry thoughts that keep me up.I also tried trazadone and propranolol, no dice. Wish I was less worried about my weight so I could try seroquel.
Signal	I have had trouble falling asleep since I was an infant. My brain has always bee too wired + stimulated at night and it just doesn't get tired. Once I do fall asleep, I usually stay asleep no problem. I find it strange that I have had sleeping problems my entire life and I just don't understand some of the causes of it. While I do have generalized anxiety, I am not at all stressed or worried at night (it is usually the opposite). I do have ADHD but a part of me still does not truly know what the disorder is. For example, I do not have 'inattention' per se, I pay good attention just maybe not on the "traditional" things. I stopped all ADHD meds about 3 years ago and functioning pretty well. Overall, I am not sure about its ties (if any) with insomnia.I have talked to my psychiatrist about this, but he keeps asking me about if I worry or stress alot at night. I don't think that is necessarily the root of my problem. Its hard to explain, but it almost feels as though my brain does not produce enough of the chemical that makes you feel sleepy. But I do not see this as a cause for insomnia on any websites.
NotSignal	Lately I havent been able to fall asleep whenever I got to bed, maybe like 2 hours laterBut tonight, I couldnt sleep. It wasnt all bad because I didnt toss and turn, I was just in my head he entire time. It wasnt a bad thing because I havent have negative thoughts and my anxiety has been good overall.I dont know what the problem is, and im worried that I should jus stay up today and take some melatonin tomorrow but I show signs of sleep apnea whenever I disrupt my sleep schedule.I dont know what to do, so any thoughts?
Signal	Hi. I've had intermittent bouts of insomnia for the last 10 years or so. Usually it starts with a lost night's sleep. Then the pressure to try and recover from it lasts for another couple of nights. Eventually, I'll get a decent night's sleep and the cycle will break. That's how the pattern usually goes.Last week, the pattern seemed to kick in again. Lost a night's sleep. Then another. And another. And another. I'm now on night 7. No sleep at all last night. I've been trying various things to help. Mindfulness. Yoga. Not staying in bed longer than 15 minutes, getting up and then trying again. Nothing is working. I start to drift and right as I'm about to drift off, I wake back up. Even if I do seem to drift, I feel like I'm half-awake. I'm 39. Married, two kids under 6. Both me and my wife have full-time jobs. We're in lockdown due to Coronavirus and the stress has been pretty high. I was doing pretty well by getting sleep, but that's been broken.I feel broken. I feel like there's a part of me that's damaged. I'm pretty scared. I'm exhausted. The worst part is since I've been here before, I know I can get through it. I just need to get that one night's decent rest. And because I know this, I feel like it's putting the pressure on me to get there. Just prove to yourself you can do it and then your mind will reset itself and we can go again. But it's completely alluding me. And I feel completely lost. I don't know why I'm writing this post. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance. Or maybe some advice or help. Or maybe it's just some catharsis. This is a very lonely time. I'm feeling a bit desperate.
Signal	It’s currently almost 3:30 am and ive not fallen asleep yet. I’ve been falling asleep without any medications for a few weeks now and tonight I just can’t feel that sleep is going to come (it will, but only at 5:30-6:00 am) . I’m thinking of taking half a sleeping pill right now my only issue is that I have to be up by 8:30 am. Is it safe? Should I just skip this night instead and take a sleeping pill next night?
Signal	So I've always had issues with sleep, mostly boiling down to having super vivid dreams that leave me feeling as though I haven't slept at all, night terrors, or sleep paralysis (and sometimes all three). As an adult, that has lessened a lot due to lifestyle changes designed to help me stay asleep, but I'll run into periods of a few weeks at a time where it'll get bad again, and I sleep through all of my alarms that I have set in the mornings.I've been tempted to try the CBD sleep gummies, just to see if they'll help at all, but I'm nervous about it because I know they have some melatonin in them. The times I've tried using melatonin to help sleep, I've experienced horrific sleep paralysis and hallucinations, worse than any others I've had in my life (and I've had a lot). Has anyone tried CBD to help sleep? Has it worked? Any unforeseen side effects? I'm just trying to gauge if it's worth testing out or not.
Signal	Hi everyone! I am sharing my vicious cycle of insomnia story, hoping to get some advice from you guys. I am 25(F) currently sleeping either every third day for 4 hours or i lay down till 7am just to get one hour of crazy vivid dreams. (Its the only time i know i have slept ). Otherwise i am fully awake trough whole night.I have always been a night owl staying till 3-4am.My sleep struggle started in January, when i switched my day to night, and opposite. At that time, i was still getting some sleep from 7am to 12 -1 pm. And then i started loosing sleep and things got worse. My sleep schedule was so messed up trough whole months till may, i was in constant loop:No sleep for 2-3 days then on third i crash for 5 hours maybe, and then i get to loop of 0-4 few days in a row or i sleep 1 day for 2-4 hour and then next 2 i dont sleep at all.I was lucky if i get 7 hours once in 3 weeks. in may i started CBT, it helped with my anxiety and general worries that comes with lack of sleep, but my sleep wasnt getting better. So i decided to go to therapist. He prescribed me trazodone and im currently on 150mg of it. It was hell of a ride first 2 weeks, on third i started sleeping normalyy, but after 4th, i couldnt sleep again. I completely lost my sleep drive, i am never sleepy, even when i am up for days, i tried all the natural ways to cure insomnia and nothing helped. If i do fallasleep,its a small amount of REM where i get crazy vivid dreams in the morning, or i fallasleep after 2 hours in bed but i am awake after 3 max 4 hours and it feel like i wasnt sleeping at all, i just open my eyes and immediately sit and i feel like i was awake all the time.Anyone has similar experience? Or tips for coping with it? Should i lower my dose of trazodone? I am thinking about going for benzos, but i am against the pills if theres still some other ways.
NotSignal	title says it all. i have spasms, double vision, and lucid screams. everyone, from online to in real life, says i'm fine, but i don't think i'm fine, not at all. i don't want to die. i don't wanna have a prion disorder.
NotSignal	Hey everyone. I just found out about this subb. This week is the first time ive had insomnia that i remember and im totally freaked out. Im a teen and usually going to sleep hasn't really been a problem until recently. In these last 3 days ive probably had max 6 hours of sleep in total. I feel really hopeless and dont know what to do. Some tips would be really helpful .
Signal	29/F. I've been having an up and down year just like many during covid. I already deal with some ptsd issues, OCD, anxiety and also a drinking issue (that I have been working on getting a handle on with programs, therapy and medications...I quit during lockdown and was fine) I have moved 5 times during this year (bad luck with roomates) I finally just signed a lease for this week and moving in a few days. I'm so stressed. I went 90 mins outside of my city with a friend and her dad to try to relax at a cottage. I feel calm but I am still dealing with insomnia. I had some drinks Thursday and she gave me some ativan and 10 mg valium to help me sleep last night. I was wide awake until 4am and slept til noon. Btw shes in recovery so I cannot bring alcohol with me (which is good) it sucks though. I've been struggling with really bad insomnia for weeks and my last move was in August and I had a severe panic attack (mind you I was on a bender) I took 2.5 valium at 10, 12, 2, and 3 am as I wasnt sure what dose would work for me. I may just take a full 10 tonight. I'm usually honest with my dr and tell him if Im taking extra benzos but I am super stressed and feel it in my body. I have a fear of sleep and why I had a bad drinking issue for many years. I'm trying to keep busy with reading, drawing and some yoga before bed. All I keep thinking about is getting a proper sleep. I'm happy if I get and early sleep and get up early but its not happening. I also think it's withdrawl too from the other day even though I have meds to help me with the anxiety and shakes...just needed to vent. Wish I could enjoy myself its beautiful here by a lake but I have that feeling in the bad of my mind of anxiety and stress
Signal	I never, ever slept properly. Since I was a kid I'd rather paint, read, sneak out and play in the garden, but not sleep. My parents always tried to put me down, took me to doctors, counseling, etc..Currently I'm on a rough patch of live, treating a major depression and anxiety (venlafaxine 225mg in the mornings, quetiapine 50mg to help sedation and anger issues) and taking 3mg of Prysma to put me down. But it never works on my PMS, no matter the hormonal treatment and supplements I take. Pulling 36 hours with 3-4 in between is no small shit.
Signal	So yeah, in the last few weeks i’ve been sleeping less and less. I have huge sleep anxiety & its become to the point where even if i’m not anxious I can’t sleep. I am not tolerating it really well anymore and want to get a prescribed medication. I was taking Zopiclone every night for a month when this insomnia started and now my body has developped a tolerance. I’ve looked up on the internet to see which medication could be easy to get prescribed but sounds like both Trazodone & Hydroxyzine both works kinda like Antistamine? (Like Benadryl or things like that) Correct me if i’m wrong. i’m worried because I already tried to take Benadryl and other OTC meds and yes they make me feel drowsy but don’t knock me out... Has anyone have any suggestion of medication that I could ask for that works the same way as Zopiclone and easy to get prescribed?
Signal	I’ve tried everything in trying to fix my brain so insomnia does not occur. But nothing is working. Every night I go to bed I get insomnia and lose about 5 hours of sleep. My brain can’t get off the mentality that this is not a thinking phase but a sleeping phase.
NotSignal	I have been able to adjust my body lately to sleep earlier but every once in a while when I relax just when Im about to sleep, I get this feeling on my hands and feet like I have to move them, as if restless and doesnt let me sleep.Any idea what this is?
Signal	I've had chronic insomnia for about five years now, and I'm a 23 yo female. Ive basically tried every prescription drug out there that is used for insomnia and I have to say, my body honestly does not react well to daily consumption of any drug. Seroquel was definitely the most helpful, but after about five weeks of taking it, my insomnia is back and the seroquel is giving me depression, low sex drive, headaches, etc. I want to stop taking it, but I'm worried I will have horrible insomnia once I do. Anyone have recs? I was thinking of trying something more natural like magnesium.
NotSignal	This has happened like 1 year ago. But it got worse as I stay up late more due to the fact I can’t sleep that much. I had like a 5% chance of getting full sleep. Wtf is this. I really want to sleep fast like when I was a chilled.
Signal	So usely i sleep around 9 hours a day and i even take a afternoon nap. But the last 3 nights i only got about 3 hours of sleep each night yet i only mildly tired today.
Signal	TW: depression, self harm, anxiety, and insomnia. I’m currently on an anti depressant/anxiety medication and I physically can’t sleep. It takes me about 5 hours to make myself tired. I like the medication because it makes me feel more positive and less anxious, but I don’t know what to do. Because I’m still party my parents medical insurance they are the ones that are in charge of my medical care. I’m scared to tell them I can’t sleep. If I tell them I can’t sleep, they’ll make me stop taking it, and everything will plummet. I have been 3 months free of self harm and my meds really help. I really want to get better. I don’t want to have panic attacks every other day. I don’t want to be hurting myself because my fucked up brain tells me to. I just want to stay healthy and normal. I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do, so any advice is wanted.
NotSignal	I find this happening to my a lot, it just gets louder and louder in my head and drives me nuts. Wondering if I'm the only one and whether there's a way of getting over this
NotSignal	Once the clock shows 5 AM, the debate starts. Should I just give up and stay up all day with the false hope that it'll make me fall asleep earlier tomorrow night?
Signal	I have been having trouble sleeping for months now. I stay awake for all the hours of the night and then I feel tired during the day. I don't want to get prescribed anything because I fear I will get addicted. I'm not sure what options I have
NotSignal	I read from sources that sedative antidepressants can be used against insomnia but the dosage is much less and taken before bed than used for depression, so my question for whoever has experience is does the small dosage still still changes your mood during the day?
NotSignal	This thought popped up in my head earlier, heheh. Made myself laugh. (So my other post got deleted due to a short-description, here's some filler lol.) I haven't seen Sleeping Beauty in a long time. If I recall the girl was under some deadly spell & the guy kissed her to save her? If so, that's so sweet. But irl I'd be pretty salty haha. Thanks but no thanks homie.🛌💤 Anyways, hope everyone is doing alright.
NotSignal	Is anybody aware of any over the counter sleeping tablets that I can go to the pharmacy today and buy? My girlfriend is desperate for a nights sleep, we tried to book a doctors appointment today but due to the way my GP is run all appointments were gone by 8:01. Any help is sincerely appreciated
Signal	Why do I keep waking up at 4am (or thereabouts?) Every morning, without fail, it was 04:02 this morning and 04:12 yesterday. I’ve checked the heating clocks etc, as the house is a steady 21° they don’t kick in much. It’s really starting to wear me down.
NotSignal	A week ago I was normal. Slept like a baby. Then I got called into a meeting in work and almost got fired. For the past week I haven’t been able to sleep. It’s not anxiety, my brain just won’t turn off to sleep. No OTC stuff works. Any ideas what I should do?
NotSignal	I tried regular Ambien but it would only put me to sleep for about an hour or two. Has anybody had any success with the controlled release version that the regular ambien didn’t work well for? I’m pretty desperate for sleep.
NotSignal	I slept almost 4 hours, like I have for the last few nights (though usually about 3 hours).I guess it's my way of seeing the positive side but I like how quiet it is. I usually just relax or do a bit of work. The other night I tried this delicious recipe. It's good for solitude though I wish I had some insomniac friends to hang out with. I do have a friend in Europe I sometimes talk with when he's not working.
Signal	I take lithium, clonidine and zolpidem at night and usual that works but sometimes, like tonight, it just doesn’t seem to help. I usually start winding down an hour before I go to bed, just things like listening to music whilst folding clothes, and I have a mood light (as the dark sets off my hallucinations. I use my phone when I can’t sleep but it’s on night screen. Any suggestions of good ways to get to sleep and/or good bed time routine?
Signal	I have this feeling in my mouth, not exactly lockjaw, but it's kinda tight. It's my second day of taking trazodone and it's also the second day I woke up like this. What can I do not to feel like this?
NotSignal	So NY mother got mad at me because I was on call at one in the morning. I can see why don't get me wrong but when she took my phone for the night I just sort of shut down. Call it whatever you guys wish but my phone is like my only outlit The person I was talking to was my crush and we weren't talking verbally but he was showing me a song and it was well.. Nice having someone to be on call with. But from that fail I now know what not to do
NotSignal	Changed my blanket since i would wake up sweaty and stressed, or not even fall asleep. Im using a very light one now and i fell asleep easily, maybe it continues like this who knows
NotSignal	I’ve always had the problem of my brain working overtime at night, but lately, because I’m pretty sure divorce after 25 years is right around the corner, all I do at night in my separate bedroom is ruminate and think about possible confrontations and the ultimate decision. I listen to podcasts but my brain won’t stop no matter what I do. I get a nap during the day, but only get a few restless hours at night. I’m sure I’m not the only one dealing with this. Anyone have any suggestions?
NotSignal	I just need to rant I guess. It is 3am and I need to be up at 7am and I cannot fall asleep to save my life. I’m irritated and anxious because I don’t want my day to be terrible because I haven’t slept but it just makes me think *why* does sleep have to be so important? Why does the idea of only getting 3-4 hours of sleep make me so anxious? Why can’t I just fall asleep?
Signal	Every time I sleep anxiety attacks me and when I do fall asleep, hypnic jerk happens. It’s been three hours and I can’t get a single minute of sleep. Every single night it has been like this where I lose 3 hours of sleep. Is there any medications to help the issue?
NotSignal	I’ve always had a complicated relationship with sleep. No matter who, or how many people I’m with I inevitably end up being the last one to fall asleep. I dread the dark, because I know it’ll leave me feeling like I’m literally the only person on this entire planet. Has anybody else ever struggled with these thoughts/feelings, and how do you combat them? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
NotSignal	ive been using a lot of natural products to sleep and honestly i cant tell if theyre working or if i have convinced myself that they do. eg. valerian root, melatonin, lavander, marijuana etc.
Signal	4:30 am -have been laying here since 1am. Now my whole day is going to be ruined.i either wake up really late and ruin my sleep for the next night or wake up at 9 and be miserable all day from being tired.
Signal	For the past few weeks I've fallen into an anxiety/insomnia pattern that I can't figure out. One poor night of sleep, say waking up at 3am and not able to fall back asleep, rolls into the next, and the next. It's been since Monday I haven't slept more than 4-5 hours a night, but I honestly feel like I haven't slept at all. It's so strange and disorienting. I feel at this point my problem is my underlying anxiety, but I am honestly scared of this feeling of as if I haven't slept at all. Last night I slept for 5 hours and it was awful. I felt awake the whole time. This evening I finally tried to nap and apparently did for 20 minutes, but I don't feel like I did. Two weekends ago I had poor sleep on Saturday that rolled into Sunday. Monday night I finally took a Emergen-ZZZZ and slept through the night. I ended up sleeping great all week (7+ hours a night) and even took a short lunchtime nap each day. I had anxiety about sleep each night but slept fine. This past weekend I had the same type of poor sleep but recovered my sleep on Sunday. Monday night I was wide awake and just could not get down. I decided not to take any sleeping aides and see if I could recover. Nope. Each night this week has been anxiety about sleep and then really poor sleep. Culminating with the feeling of having not slept at all, even if I have! Caring for our four year old and getting anything done has become a chore. My wife bought my some Pure ZZZs with Melatonin and Ashwagandha I will try tonight. Does anyone else experience this? Am I going mad or will this pass eventually?
NotSignal	Not sure what the best way to go about this without looking spammy, but I'd like to give 4 members of this subreddit a free pack of our Full Spectrum CBD mints - no strings attached. Whichever flavor.I am truly interested in if it can help you rest easier. As we have had good feedback from some of our customers/family/and friends.I guess the best way would be the first 4 people that reply to this qualify.
Signal	Stressing and over thinking at 4:50 is never a good thing. 4th night in a row. Lucky me, currently jobless, like many others right now. Just waking up constantly stressing. Could blame Covid but I’ve been plagued with this bs since 2014. That is all.
Signal	Whenever I get no sleep, I have lots of adrenaline that keeps me energetic the next day. Then, a night of decent sleep and the following day I'm super mentally tired. I don't have the energy to act like myself and I feel super self concious and anxious all day. Also random boners lol. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
Signal	I've had issues sleeping for the past year on and off, due to PTSD, stress, and anxiety. But recently, I've been hitting the gym again and I've been getting super anxious and then can't sleep at night. Anyone experience this specifically after you start working out again?
Signal	For about a more than a year now, I have been dealing with intense anxiety-induced sleep deprivation. I have tried everything, meds, meditation, weed, hypnosis, etc. Nothing but marijuana has worked, but now even marijuana is beginning to give me intense panic attacks. The prevailing advice that has been hammered into my head is to just stop worrying about sleep. But how am I supposed to stop worrying about sleep when I am missing multiple days of sleep and absolutely unable to function as a result? How am I supposed to not worry about lacking sleep when a day of sleep deprivation feels like my mind is trying to torture me? What can I do to fix this? What can I tell myself to end this constant worrying about not getting sleep? How can I break this endless cycle of worrying about sleep and then not getting sleep and then worrying about sleep because im not getting sleep?
Signal	Hi guys, I'm new to this page but I am really struggling to sleep. I have such bad anxiety and I've tried so many things to shut my brain off like writing all of my thoughts down before bed, playing sleeping podcasts, apps, natural sleeping tablets like kalms. The doctor doesn't want to prescribe me with mild tranquillisers due to their addictive nature so I am wondering if anyone could please offer me some insight into what helps them sleep because I am in tears writing this. I just want to sleep
NotSignal	I just woke up with a rem rebound and only got 1 hour of sleep before waking up, I had a weird dream and it kinda felt real because all the things I was thinking before going to bed appeared in my dream.
NotSignal	Hello guys,so its the 5th week with only terrible sleep now, from no sleep to fucked up sleep patterns, i had it all.Lately im feeling very lightheaded when i stand up or walk, it's really annoying. I would try to lay down at 11pm or 1 am and fall asleep for maybe 2 hours, wake up and the fall asleep at 5 or6 am again and wake up at 9 am, and its probably very light sleep since everything noisy, like opening a door wakes me up and im not rly remembering any dream.. &#x200B;Anybody having experience with his sleeping rhytm being messed up like this? i would really love to go back to sleep at 11 or 12 pm and wake up at 6 am..
Signal	Hi I currently take 15 mg mirtazapine per night. In the beggining I found it to help tremendously but unfournately my insomnia is back. And I need something to add to get my sleep back before I go crazy. Yesterday I knocked my self out with bunch of benzos + weed just cause I hadn't slept in 4 days. But obviously this was just a temporary solution as I hate both those drugs due to previous addiction that I don't want again. So I was wondering if I could add in a trazodone instead for a good nights sleep. But due to anxiety I'm worried about potential seretonin syndrome.
Signal	I fall asleep at 9-10... wake up at 11... stay up stressing and worrying about my health, my job, how I want to prove I don't need anyone, coping with my loss of hearing/ear damage, assuming the worse and not being able to rest... despite having a FULL 10-12 hours of labor tomorrow.
NotSignal	Maybe already been discussed, but has anyone ever heard of the "Thatcher Gene"? What are your thoughts if you have?
NotSignal	Right now I can’t sleep and it’s been three hours since I’ve been in bed. I do not have anxieties or feel like I’m panicking but for some reason my body keeps jerking when I am drifting off to go to sleep. Does anyone know what to do?
NotSignal	So many of us are extremly fatigued chronically by now. I tried to do cardio while being tired and it backfired, i almost fainted. Pushups are fine but they don't wear my out enough to fall asleep. Does anybody have a healthy recommendation of exercises, or things someone could do to become tired, maybe even at home?
Signal	I’m thinking of checking myself into a hotel for a few days. I can’t really explain why it prob makes no sense, I guess I’m just sick to death of laying awake all night every night in my same bedroom I swear it’s giving me ptsd. It’s been 9 months now since I’ve slept more than a light 3-4 hours and that’s only when I take a sleeping pill. With no pill I don’t sleep at all and can’t even regulate any kind of circadian rhythm. I’m also living with my parents (can’t keep a job coz of insomnia so no money and no place of my own). I need to come off the pills as they’re making me physically so ill but I know I won’t sleep for several days. I kind of have imagined this hotel room for myself where I can just chill and cold turkey from the pills, but because I’ll be there alone I won’t feel that pressure to get up at a certain time or pretend to be more ok than I really am. My parents have been amazing at supporting me through this but one of the hardest things is the frustration at them not understanding truly how much I’m suffering. I feel like they think I’m just a little tired but really I’m so exhausted physically and mentally that I can barely find the will to keep going with life. Does anyone else ever get the urge to like run away for a few days to suffer alone?!
NotSignal	Now I assumed weighted blankets weren't for me. I run hot and they were way out of my price range. In December/January I had a really bad patch of insomnia. I decided to save up and get one. I am so glad I did. I'm not saying i dont have insomnia anymore i do but it's so much better. It doesn't last as long. They can take upto a month to work and did with me. I was getting ready to send it back. Now I take it with me If I stay at a friends ect. I'm not saying it's going to work for you but I have had insomnia since I was 10 (30 now) and this is the first thing that's really helped. I would highly recommend trying one out. (Please no hate on this post I'm only trying to help)
Signal	During this year I have progressively had worse insomnia. The only things that have helped so far is benzos but I’m no longer prescribed and I’m looking for any advice (medication or not) that can help me out.
Signal	Low and behold -- something that I'm "not supposed" to take to combat insomnia from Prozac, actually helped me fall asleep and sleep for 5 cumulative hours, which for my insomnia is an accomplishment. I've always gotten sleepy from ibuprofen before, and that's why I almost never used it and ended up taking Tylenol and/or Naproxen instead. But I was going crazy from insomnia for the last 3 or 4 days and was trying Melatonin (that makes me feel crappy) and Trazodone (that makes me feel hungry). I defied every urge I had to take Xanax. Then I thought wait a minute, I get sleepy on ibuprofen, let me try that and it worked. But darnit I'm "not supposed" to be taking it with my other medication, so essentially - - I have to go back to suffering?
Signal	So, I had a bout of insane insomnia a few months ago where I would stay away usually for 72 hours, sleep for 3 hours, then repeat. I'm now pretty much convinced that it was the result of getting sober due to an addiction to gabapentin and other random opiates I was doing numerous times a week.But when my insomnia hit.. I had a job. The fear of not getting sleep was the worst part, and for some reason when the sun would rise i'd have even more anxiety thinking "if i sleep i'll wake up at 4 pm then be up all night again"I ended up getting fired for being forgetful and not knowing how to give customers correct change back because I'd space out so hard. After I lost the job.. I just stopped caring. I ended up staying up for 3 nights at a time for about a week after getting fired, and then I started sleeping with the help of benadryl. I'm not at all excited to go back to work. So far today I've did my daily weight lifting routine and went on 3 jogs.. all 3 being about a half a mile each. I want to exhaust myself so I will sleep tonight. Does anyone find day running to help? i'm not sure what to do.. or if i just wanted to rant.
Signal	Hey i recently got put on some insomnia course where they monitor my sleep diaries and give feedback. I got put on sleep restriction course (2am-7am) but after a week it proper screwed me up. But also reading through their help articles I found one about delayed sleep phase syndrome, and was basically like that's me. The only thing was 'given their own choice of sleep cycle the person will have less/no problem sleeping' which isn't the case, but when I was at uni it was always natural for me to go to bed 3am and wake up 10ish, and mostly no where as bad as trying to work a fixed hours now . To my surprise they instantly told me to stop sleep restriction and they will refer me to get checked out further I believe. I'm only just learning about but curious if anyone else has been diagnosed with. I'm really struggling with work and it's so hard when there's no one to relate to in real life.
Signal	I’ve had chronic insomnia for years now and it’s just been getting worse and worse. Nowadays I literally can’t sleep at all until the sun comes up. I feel a bit tired before bed, but when I try to sleep I feel more awake and alert than ever. And this is after all the medications I take. Tonight I took 50mg trazodone, 1.5 mg Ativan, 20 mg melatonin, 40 mg atarax, and magnesium supplements. Basically the highest dose of everything, and still nothing. There seems to be no solutions left. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but what I do know is that I can’t live like this forever.
NotSignal	Im sure we all have this predicament.I’m wide awake right now and it’s 8:40am. I’ve had no sleep but I’m considering staying up until 6pm to reset my pattern. I know if I sleep now I’ll wake up at like 6pm. What do you usually do at times like this?
NotSignal	I lay in bed and my heart feels like it’s racing, but when i check my pulse, it’s fine.My breath feels too shallow, but I’m still breathing.Too hot for a blanket.Eventually i drift off only to shoot back up and awake after i think my mind realizes I fell asleep.Then hours pass and i do fall asleep, only to wake up 5-6 hours later.I need this to stop.
NotSignal	Ideally I am looking for an app that can record video in very low light so I can watch my sleep to see if I toss and turn. I wake up frequently in the night. Alternative would be if you have suggestions for best app to record sound only, if there is not a good option for seeing in low light on iphone. Thanks in advance.
Signal	My disorder destroyed my future. I’m a highschool dropout. I read a lot of posts and I cannot classify myself anywhere.. People complain about staying awake for days, or sleeping very less, but it’s different for me. I cannot stay awake for more than 24 hours. Even with caffeine. But I sleep for 12-21 hours. I stay awake for 18-24 hours. So it’s a both sleep-awake cycle issue. Doctors don’t seem to take me seriously after telling me I naturally stay awake and also sleep for an almost full day. I last had a sleep schedule 2 years ago. Before I gave up highscool. It became impossible to sleep at normal times. My sleep-wake cycle started to grow at a low rate and escalaed to what is it now in 2 years. At least it didn’t get any much worse, I’m the same for 2 years. But I do not live a normal life. I both slept and woken up at every hour in the clock. My issue is that once I get sleepy, nothing keeps me up anymore. I tried drinking 15 energy drinks in 2 hours to keep me awake the whole day so I can sleep the other evening once and I just fell asleep. Caffeine has zero effect on me, it never had, no other than that massive amounts like that almost give me panic attacks. It’s also impossible for me to get woken up and stay awake. I wake up easy. Actually very easy, as a normal person would. I can set an alarm every minute at the lowest volume and I’ll wake up each time. But I cannot stay awake. It got even to the point of getting splashed repeatedly with freezing cold water in the face, dragged out of bed (by my parents and I told them to do this). Those were the times I was still trying to attend highschool. Even after a 16 hour sleep if I don’t do my full natural hours of sleep I CANNOT stay awake, my eyes close by themselves. You can wake me up after 2 or 20 hours of sleep and I’ll feel the same unless I woken up.I fell asleep while standing. I fall asleep in seconds doing anything possible to stay awake (when trying to force myself to wake up). My eyes close by themselves and I get into deep sleep in seconds. I get so angry when people especially my family just don’t understand how bad is it and they say I just became a very lazy person or I am depressed. And they just tell me to sleep early/stay awake the whole day and sleep the other evening and done I fixed my schedule. I want to punch people in the face who don’t understand how bad is it. I went to doctors and they don’t take me seriously, so everything I’ve ever tried is random natural medicines prescribed and Stilnox 10mg (Zolpidem). I got a Stilnox prescription once and less thăn 40mg did nothing to me other than getting me a little high. More than that ended up in me sleepwalking almost each time. Also it had no use to me because remember, I sleep for double- almost triple the normal amount. I pretty much lost hope anything can be done to fix me. I just wonder what is it. How can you fix someone who stays awake a lot and also sleeps a lot? Did anyone ever went through something similar? I’m sorry for my bad english btw, I am not a native speaker. I hope I made myself understood.
Signal	Last time i did a reset was 4 months ago.Sleeping at 7pm and waking up at 3am. It has been slowly drifting daily though, no matter how hard i try to stabilize it with an alarm clock and the occasional diphenhydramine.And now we're here, 6 am and still awake 🤷🏽‍♂️ Spent 5 hours lying in bed for nothing.Considering going zombie today and skipping work to hopefully get a 'reset'.
Signal	Hi to all fellow insomniacs,I have had chronic insomnia since a child and i have tried different sleeping aides in the past such as pills etc but they have never worked.Even when i was a teen my parents got me medication for it but still no luck.I would stay up for around 26 - 40 hours literally staying up for close to almost 2 days, then sleep for 6-8 hours and do the same thing again after waking up, staying up longer than i had slept.This would happen every day for three weeks then i would eventually stay up and fix my sleeping schedule for it to only last at the most a week before starting the same cycle for another 3 weeks.My life has been quite unstable in the past few years because of this.I have been doing this for longer than 5 years now and like i said, it also occurred during childhood and my teens.I am now 24 and recently just 2 weeks ago i fixed my sleeping schedule where i am now waking up between 6am-9am then going to sleep between 8pm-11pm.It has been like this for two weeks and has been the longest i have kept my sleeping schedule together since i can remember.However what i have noticed is, although i have now gotten control over my sleeping schedule, i am waking up feeling exhausted everyday which is giving me major brain fog as i feel tired to the extent of not being able to focus.For the past 2 weeks although my sleeping schedule for once in my life is normal, i feel worse off than when it would be unstable.Why do i feel so exhausted even though i have been having the correct amount of sleep for the past two weeks?I wake up several times during the night, about 5 or more times every night which then takes me 10 - 30 minutes to get back to sleep, so the quality of sleep isn't good.Will this exhaustion ever go away because i seriously am unable to focus on anything because my eyes feel very heavy even after just waking up and my brain feels foggy where i cant think or focus on basic things.I am unable to focus because i just feel like sleeping to get rid of the tired feeling but then when i sleep it doesn't refresh me at all and i feel like i have had no sleep.Why is this happening even though i have now gotten a grip on my sleeping schedule?Any advice would be great thanks.
NotSignal	This is getting out of control I feel like I’m being watched I can’t close my eyes I get adrenaline and cortisol rushes. I feel so helpless I’m not sure if I’m going to make trough this this is a mental torture
NotSignal	From ages 12 till last month I used to think about nice things until I lulled myself to sleep. Sometimes I'd think about my teenage crushes. Sometimes I'd just imagine dying and when I died in my little story that's when I fell asleep. In fact, I was so obsessed with imagining death that I fell asleep easily on every single car ride, every break between classes and every opportunity that presented itself. Un/fortunately with the recent round of midsems, even macabre methods of death I'd stolen from intense books and movies lost their appeal. Stuck in this rat race of regurgitating facts about immunoglobulins and viruses, my imagination just? turned itself off? I'd pretty much gotten over every crush I've had and metal guitarists just don't work the same way. Basically, I've run out of nice thoughts and am stuck in a vortex of apathy where I'm staring into the darkness, listening to my own breathing for hours on end.Is this what growing up is like? Do I need to read another angsty manga about a love hexagon, or am I long overdue to learn a coping mechanism besides emo love stories and death?
Signal	Has anyone here already had the experience that no more drugs seem to work? I am currently taking 100 mg doxepin and 7.5 mg zopiclone; but hardly sleep with it...It just pisses me off that I lost my life to insomnia.
NotSignal	The past 2 months, I’ve only slept 1 night without some sort of drug. As in either melatonin, ZZZquil, or some sort of antihistamine. My theory was that I could go a couple days on an antihistamine, switch to melatonin, then sometimes I’d be on a cold medicine cause I happened to get sick. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’m in college and def can’t get evaluated at the school I’m at, the doctors don’t know shit here, or even in the surrounding town. Is this bad what I’m doing? I just figured that if I’m switching, I’m ~semi~ becoming dependent on these instead of fully. I think I’m losing my mind lmao.
NotSignal	Do I just close my eyes and no matter how long it takes and no matter how many random thoughts go through my mind will I fall asleep eventually if I just don’t open them
Signal	I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now and insomnia has always been an issue we come back to. Over the past 10 months I have resorted to using alcohol to get to sleep then use medical marijuana to get me back to sleep when I wake in the middle of the night. This week she told me to focus on my sleep issues and we developed a plan to cut out alcohol, do yoga before bed to unwind, and set a sleep schedule. The first night I only slept maybe 1 hour. I went to bed at 9 and couldn’t sleep so I got up at 11:30pm and read then went back to bed at 1:30am and I think I dozed until 2:45am then I got up and read some more and tried to go back to sleep at 5am and slept till about 6:30am. I was ridiculously grumpy and tired so last night I said f it and drank alcohol and smoked when I woke up in the middle of the night. I at least slept for 4-5 hours. I know I should follow our plan but imagining another night without sleep kills me.
NotSignal	I am recovering from surgery and it is hard to get comfortable. I've struggled with insomnia for decades, but since surgery, it's been extremely bad. &#x200B;I've tried meditation, reading, eye mask, soothing sounds, deep breathing, distracting podcasts. Nothing helps! Anyone has successful tips?
Signal	i have been dependent on Benadryl to sleep since i was 17. can go for days without much sleep at all (feel like crap during the day) and crash really hard days later, cycle repeats. when i "sleep" i never feel like i hit that deep state it's surface level + light cycle sleep. i never feel mentally sharp during the day anymore. i NEED caffeine to wake up and get things done because of my insomnia. cutting out caffeine has done no good, i remain drowsy during day either way. prescribed sleeping meds never helped me only messed me up further, the heavy duty insomnia / antidepressants / antianxiety pills they put me on never benefitted me except messed up my health and brain. work really hard in academics, i hold a job, i workout consistently and eat healthy. my insomnia is my biggest health concern. it has not gotten any better. people have suggested getting a sleep study done. any advice 😞 this is truly ruining my life. i feel like if my sleep health was improved my quality of life would drastically change.
NotSignal	I've taken 7 25 mg tablets tonight and still nothing's. Its 5 30 am. If I take like 10 more will I pass out?
NotSignal	I remember reading a recommendation somewhere that if you can't sleep within 15-30 minutes of crawling into bed, it's helpful to get up and do something else for a bit (e.g., reading a book, meditation), and then go back to bed.I've actually tried this before and sometimes it helps. For example, I'll try reading a fiction book for 30 minutes and then go back to bed. However, most of the time it just takes too much willpower to do this. I already feel exhausted and frustrated; the last thing I want to do is get up and do something (even moreso because I feel like I'm losing out on precious minutes that I could be sleeping). Even if I'm uncomfortable - tossing and turning, unable to find an 'ideal' position - I still would rather lay down and be miserable than get up. Can anyone else relate to this? If so, how do you overcome this mental roadblock?
Signal	Hello, so basically I’ve always struggled with sleep my whole life, mainly falling asleep. When i was 16 i discovered marijuana and that put me to sleep instantly most nights so I became a daily smoker. I am now just 19 years old. Prior to turning 19 i had no mental health problems, dependent on marijuana yes but still it had no negative effects on me. Since i turned 19 i had quite a few nights where i only slept 4 hours a night and then this became normal. Weed no longer puts me to sleep either. Over these last 3 weeks of not sleeping well I can clearly tell that ive become sleep deprived and the last two nights I have not slept at all. I’ve done some googling and it feels like ive acquired aphantasia - i can no longer maintain mental images of things. I would like to no if this is most likely an effect of my sleep deprivation and not actually my mind stopping me from imagining things. It feels like im in a loop and i’m hoping its just a need for a good nights sleep to get me going again.Any suggestions would be amazing to ease my mind as I currently feel like im losing it a bit.
NotSignal	What is going on? Why can’t I sleep? This has been going on for 5 years now.
NotSignal	Laying down all i can think of is the fact that I’m falling through my life. I feel fine during the day, but when I look for rest I get this painful introspection. Comparing my path to others, what I have now to what I used to, and how things are on track to becoming worse. I feel this overwhelming sense that I’m going down the wrong path and that I’m not doing enough to succeed in life. So I’ll watch tv until I can’t focus anymore, and then try to sleep again. Usually it lets me sleep. About once a week, however, it does not. These nights I don’t sleep at all and do anything to avoid thinking about it. I thought I’d try talking about it instead.
Signal	When I went to my primary, all they did was prescribe pills that didn't work. I used to be able to sleep fine on the weekends. Now I've been up since 1am and I don't know what to do
Signal	Im tired asf but cannot sleep. Ive been like this for a few days. Some nights ill fall asleep and wake up at 4 any help/suggestions
NotSignal	I can usually fall asleep around 11:30 which is actually really good compared to a lot of people with sleep disorders but tonight I tried to go to bed around 9 and uh, now im up sobbing at 12:41 cuz I don't feel tired at allagainno where near as bad as some of y'allI'm kinda just an emotional whimp
Signal	Hello friends, in the past few weeks I've been suffering from a very problematic fit of insomnia. Twice a week I get nights with no sleep and the rest is about 4-5 hours. It takes me 2-4 hours to fall asleep. I am only 18 and currently working full time at a butcher shop due to the pandemic. It has greatly affected my ability to work and function. Even smoking cannabis doesnt help me fall asleep, which seems very strange. Any ideas on how I should tackle this problem? (No anxiety or mental health issues btw)
NotSignal	This is so fucking dumb and I know everyone in this sub is tired of hearing about it but my mind has convinced me I have SFI. I have been going through severe debilitating insomnia for roughly two months, starting from being bumped up on my Celexa. After that I developed an irrational fear of sleep and refused to sleep for many days resulting in the most traumatic experiences I have ever had. After I got over the fear, I tried everything from Unisom to Trazodone to fall asleep again and they only worked for a little while then they didn't. It takes me hours and hours to fall asleep, I have severe vertigo, and my visual snow and tinnitus are out of control. I also get muscle twitches and spasms and horrendous hypnogogia, for instance 2 nights ago I had a vivid hallucination of me having a stroke and the entire fabric of reality tearing as I walked up the stairs calling for help. This all stresses me out so, so much and I keep having breakdowns every day over the fact that I just can't sleep normally anymore. I'm not even sure I slept last night, I only have a faint memory of a vivid dream. I'm only 16 and my hands now look like they belong to a 40 year old woman because of all the stress and lack of sleep I've experienced. I am also convinced I'm losing oxygen as I sleep because my breathing just gets so shallow. I'm so sick and tired of this, someone knock some sense into me. Just please. I can't trust myself anymore.I have an appointment at 1pm to tell the nurse practitioner about all of this. I'm so scared but I hope she'll give me some medication or advice that'll be sufficient to me.
NotSignal	It is just past midnight now, and I don't even know how that happened. I'm also just now realizing that I have only eaten breakfast. I feel like it is worse in the winter when it gets dark earlier.
Signal	Started experience Insomnia first time in my life. I’ve had troubles falling asleep in the past but nothing big. It has now been a month since I started experience Insomnia, had some days where I have not slept for up to 72 hours and it really gets to my head. I get anxiety for not being able to sleep, it kills me at night and drains all me energy. I went to the doctor and he diagnosed me with Insomnia. Got very scared and thought it was the end of my life. I really hope it’s not chronic and just something in my head. Only using Melatonin and it does not really work for me. Anyone else who just can’t sleep because there thinking to much about sleep?😩
Signal	112 hours or so. i just couldn’t sleep whilst i was on holiday... would rather risk shoving valium up my arse through airport security than being awake for 4 and a half days. i was almost passing out everytime i stood and hallucinating so much i couldn’t relax, despite my desperate need to fucking relax. never again...
Signal	Was badly struggling with insomnia last week and was averaging 2 hours of sleep each night but this week I’ve made progress and I’ve managed to bump that up to an average 5 hours of sleep each night but since Monday I’ve been waking up at 6:30 every morning without fail for no apparent reason. 2 weeks ago I would normally wake up at about 10 am after getting about 8 hours of sleep and I don’t know how to break this routine of waking up at 6:30 AM. I go to bed at 1am normally if that info is useful.
NotSignal	Ugh, I spend way too much on sleeping. It feels unfair lol
NotSignal	My dad got me a weighted blanket and I'm super excited to try it out! I'm chilling rn with it over me and right off the bat it feels pretty nice. It's apparently supposed to help with anxiety, depression and insomnia etc all of which I struggle with so hopefully this works :) I've heard lots of great things so far but everyone's experience is different of course. Anyone here who has experience with a weighted blanket?
Signal	To me, it feels like I haven’t slept in days. When I go to sleep, I lay in bed with my eyes closed, but my brain doesn’t shut off and I can’t stop thinking. I feel extremely aware of my surroundings, like I can hear the traffic or wind outside my window, and I don’t think I’m asleep. However, for me it feels like maybe 15 minutes have past, but I check my clock and it’s been over an hour of laying there with my eyes closed. It feels like as the hours go by and my alarm goes off, I’ve gotten zero sleep. But there’s no way I’d be able to function properly with days and weeks of this in a row, although the lack of sleep does make me feel extremely tired and dizzy.Insomnia runs in my family, but I started doing research on sleep misperception and I’m wondering if this is what is happening. Any opinions? And is there a fix for this?
Signal	This time, I did all the right things. I shut my phone off. I turned my TV off. I meditated and listening to calming music. I was relaxed and slowly drifted off to sleep. Then an hour later, I had a nightmare, popped up and stayed up for the rest of the night. I tried to go back to sleep, but it didn’t happen and now, I am just tired and annoyed.
Signal	I've been having a bout with insomnia for the past few weeks and have been using diphenhydramine and nyquil to help me sleep. It worked for the first week or so, but nowadays I've noticed that it just makes me feel groggy but simultaneously antsy... which ultimately makes it impossible to fall asleep. I normally take 2 pills of either before bed. I'm thinking of stopping though, because I think it's honestly starting to make my sleep issues worse. Anyone else have any similar experiences with OTC sleeping pills?
Signal	It's currently 5:40 am here and I have to wake up at 9:00 am. Tomorrow I have a big day ahead of me and I can't stop thinking about it.I've tried everything, every single method to fall asleep, I have taken melatonin twice now (which I think I shouldn't have done in the first place), I killed the fucking mosquito that was annoying me for hours, my whole body is hot and itchy. There isn't a position I feel confortable, I've been going through a lot of stress lately which isn't helping me.Anyway I just wanted to express myself, see if I can share my badly written story with someone else
Signal	I had surgery 2 weeks ago. I really have slept since.Pain management is certainly part of the problem but I can't get passed it. Not the first time. I've been cut up more than a pig at the butcher. Still though, can't sleep... I don't remember the several, similar, surgeries causing this much grief. I'm lost. TiredVery tired.
NotSignal	it's 6:30 am now, still awake.Light peering softly through my curtains. Boyfriend peacefully asleep in bed, Weather is slightly cool too. I feel so calm and at ease. I feel like i've finally made it, like being on top of the mountain after a long hike and just being immersed by a sublime feeling. Or in an ending of a film, where everything's over and you finally walk away.I feel like the song 'i'm coming down' by Primal Scream.I rarely feel this way in my life. I suffer from severe anxiety, but right now i feel like i can ride with anyone and be anywhere. That feeling like i'm gonna be okay. The same way i felt during the best times of my life.It's just so weird and ironic, that when i'm literally wrecking my body, fucking up my body clock, tired AF, is when i feel so blissful. Is there a scientific reason for it?Yep, you know that feeling.
NotSignal	It's early days but I made a change and it seems to be improving how I sleep. One of the problems I was having was getting too sweaty as I sleep. I figured out that it's only a big problem when my wife is also in the bed. So, I got a bed of my own and it appears to be helping. It's only been a couple of days but day 1 I had my first 7 hour uninterrupted sleep in recent memory.I'm also disturbing her less with any tossing and turning and getting up if I can't sleep.
NotSignal	So basically the more you think about it and making everything perfect about your sleep and the more you need it the less likely you are to get it.What causes my insomnia ( not sleeping at all all night ) seems to always be wanting to sleep and thinking how important it is and how bad it is not to sleep.Every time I slept well I did not care about sleeping whatsoever and vice versa every time I cared a lot i did not sleep a minute for days.Any one finds this familliar?
NotSignal	I always feel either way more worried, sad, happy or anything at night do any of you guys feel this?I also think I hear every bump,crack and screek a lot more. Anyone else?
NotSignal	Starting CBT-I today and want to know if anyone has had success using sleeping pills for a short duration while applying the skills they are learning from CBT-I?
NotSignal	I have VERY VERY LOW tolerance to sleep deprivation. My sleep issues are plethoric, ie, not sleeping a wink for >72 hours, sleeping >12 hours/day for a week and in a constant state of rem-rebound, other times sleeping just fine and feeling like I’ve finally beaten my insomnia, till the next cycle rears its ugly head. If I miss ANY sleep (even in a “good” week) I am an absolute non-functional mess tHe next day. Not quite “tired,” but like spaced out af. Complete inability to concentrate, no matter how much I caffinate/hydrate. Any tips or tricks for surviving the day after??
NotSignal	If you have do you have any recommendations? I have barely been able to sleep in the last 4 years. I need to try something new.
Signal	I just learned what FFI is and I'm scared to death because some of the symptoms sounds familiar.I'm 18 years old, and have been a chronic insomniac my entire life. About a year ago I began experiencing difficulty with my memory, such as not being able to recall life events, or what I had for dinner a few days ago. I also began experiencing a very strange feeling of disconnect from the world as I was awake, as if I was dreaming. As I am also a very anxious person I talked to my psychologist about it and they said it was derealization/depersonalization but after learning about FFI I am paranoid that it isn't. I have noticed that I get strange muscle spasms occasionally and virtually every muscle in my body is constantly stiff (these are symptoms of the condition apparently).Am I just being paranoid? I am so scared
Signal	I am prescribed ambien 10mg for as needed sleep, I take modafinil 200mg daily. The ambien has worked well for a while but now it’s extremely sporadic and I don’t understand why. I almost always eat 2+ hours before I take it, and I don’t take it every night, yet for the last couple weeks I’ll have nights where I’ll take it and I’m up for hours and hours and never feel anything in the slightest. It’s like I didn’t even take the pill at all. Then other nights I take it and it works great and I’m asleep within 45 minutes. Has anyone experienced this? Have any idea why some nights there is absolutely no effect?
Signal	I've been experiencing sleep deprivation for few months now I always wake up halfway through my sleep and can't fall back to sleep it's usually happen consecutively for a few days to weeks , I've no problem falling asleep but once I wake up halfway through my sleep it's hard to fall asleep again and now I've been experiencing it 3weeks straight ,I only get atleast 2-4hrs of sleep everynight
NotSignal	I’ve been dealing with insomnia for the better part of 3 months. Though I’m not as bad as some others in this thread, a few days ago I actually managed two nights of back to back 7 hour nights of sleep. But these past two nights recently I’ve been unable to fall asleep at a good time. When I fall asleep I can stay asleep but if I need to be up for work at 7 and I fall asleep at 4 it’s still an issue. Unfortunately I can’t just stay in bed until 11 and then show up to work.It seems my sleep is work related because I tend to be able to sleep easier the closer it is to the weekend.
NotSignal	If you haven’t slept the night before, do you drink a coffee and go about your day? Are you in a bitchy mood all day sitting around half assing you, do you fake it till you make it and take them out and try to do whatever to make the day go by quicker while your slowly die inside, how do you deal with days without sleep? Do you nap with them around? Ect.Normally I will be awake all night and able to set my toddler up with breakfast and tv and I’ll sleep from 8-11 or noon then I’ll sit around at home all day in a miserable mood just counting the hours till dads home from work because he’s literally great and will bath, feed, clean the house and put son to bed so I can get my ass into bed at 6pm (I don’t sleep right away but I read and either end up falling asleep around 10 or having another rough night I seriously never know which) but today was different because we already had some somewhat laid back plans which I thought would make the day even worse (who wants to leave the house or even drive a car with kids and no sleep) 5am I gave up, 7am I had coffee, 8am I feel asleep 8:40 my son woke up I fed him and put the tv on and slept till 10:30. 10:30-12 I got us ready for the beach with family and friends. 12-5 at the beach which I thought would be the worst part of my day yeah was tough but was actually WAYYYYY fuckin easier then sitting home half ass cleaning and snapping at my kid and counting the hours till dads home. I got home at 5:30 and it’s now almost 7 and I’ve sat on my ass being annoyed by toddler begging dad to get his ass home. These almost 2 hours went by way slower then the five at the beach? I really wasn’t expecting that.How do you deal? What do you do?
Signal	Hello.About 24 hours ago I decided to take an old antidepressant that’s been in my pantry for several months to help me stay up to complete assignments. I took this medication for a year and a half in the past. At the point of taking it I had been up almost 12 hours with just a couple hours of sleep. In the past 40 hours, I’ve gotten maybe 4 hours of sleep and now I cannot fall asleep. I recently took a normal dose of melatonin and it did nothing. I have not been up this long before and I’m kind of worried and my mind is racing a bit. Maybe I’m just an insomnia amateur? Any advice appreciated.
NotSignal	I’ve been using melatonin for a year and a half on and off now and for the past few days I haven’t slept at all. So far it’s been 48 hours since I was last asleep. Is it possible that the melatonin has caused this? I’d like to note that it’s no longer effective no matter how much of it I take.
Signal	As my title says, I am taking melatonin. I can't fall asleep without it nowadays. The first few months, I took 3 mg of melatonin because I kept waking up from sleep every few hours.I was diagnosed with IBS which started my insomnia actually. Before that my sleep was 5 to 6 hours but wasn't too bad. The weird thing is that i don't have pain while I sleep. No need to go to bathroom either. So i have no idea whats keeping my brain awake. Anxiety and stress were treated through CBT with therapist/psychologist. I'd say my IBS is in control nowadays.Anyway, does anyone know if melatonin makes a person pill-dependent? Meaning you pretty much make body prone to not producing its own melatonin? Ive lowered the dose to .3 mg or 1 mg the last several weeks which make me fall asleep eventually. It is frustrating. I don't want to become pill dependent. Does anyone here have experience using melatonin for a LONG time? How has it affected you?
NotSignal	I can be almost asleep standing up and as soon as i touch my bed its like all physical tiredness is gone. But mentally I feel like I'm dying.
NotSignal	This is going to sound dumb- but I don’t have insurance, and also am extremely broke so I usually try to avoid doctor visits unless they’re absolutely necessary.But where can I get prescribed sleeping pills?. Would I be able to get them from a minute clinic or urgent care or would I need to see a specialist?. I don’t have a primary care doctor. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I can’t handle my insomnia anymore.
NotSignal	I had it pretty regularly act up most my childhood and teenage years. I got over it near the end of teenage years and normally am fine but now with this coronavirus thing it seemingly has come back. There's no anxiety or anything, I just have no reason to go to bed as there's nothing too important to do the next day. Any tips on how to help it? I don't feel tired the next day just not as energetic and happy and lifting is harder. Thanks.
Signal	Occasionally I'll have sleepless nights, where I feel as if I'm re-living events of the day. I feel stuck in a trance, half asleep, half awake, throughout the entire night. This happens rarely and usually after a big social event. For example, after most parties, I go to I fall "asleep" and end up imagining myself at the party the entire night without being able to stop, not consciously trying to do so. The next day I just feel groggy and tired. Does anyone know if this is insomnia or something else?
NotSignal	I’m just curious I don’t get many hours but I want to hear other peoples sleep hours.
NotSignal	Here ya go boys and gals. 1. Keep your sleep schedule consistent as possible.2. Only be in your bed when your ready for a night's rest3. Make your room as cold as you can stand.4. Get weighted blanket. They really help with the restlessness feeling5. Finally, if you find that you still can't sleep. Exercise for 10-20 minutes. I promise you'll see results. (I go for a light jog)This is my best advice I can give. Follow it and experiment with it. And feel free to add any tips below.Edit: Added a few things and corrected punctuation
Signal	as im sure many of you can empathize with this, quarantine has exacerbated what i once assumed was a condition i had under my control. sure, it had its flare ups here and there, but wasn't exactly a pressing issue i thought would consume my thoughts to the degree it has. every night is torture. i feel hollowed out. like my brain is cannibalizing itself. i wish i was able to succumb to sleep when i feel it coming but i don't know how to consciously let go and slip into unconsciousness. i fear that one night i might actually act on the impulse to end it all instead of merely fantasize about the sweet reprieve it'll grant me from these sleepless nights. i've tried a few sleep hypnosis videos that surprisingly worked for a few days in a row, but let old habits slip the next day and unwittingly consumed nearly an entire dime bag's worth of matcha (to be fair, i'm a college student with generally a high tolerance to caffeine, and i'm slowly realizing that my body's not as invincible as i thought it was). turns out melatonin dosing is an exact science with a success rate that's highly sensitive to the slightest of change in external factors (e.g., time, bmi, diet, dosage--i dont need to further explain myself) and i dont necessarily have the patience or the sanity left to conduct any remaining experiments by adjusting certain variables. i tell myself that this is purely psychological, that i'm *making* sleep *happen* rather than *waiting* for it to *arrive.* that i'm in control. i just need to give myself permission to fall asleep, but this feels more like a hostage situation with each sunrise. i need to see a sleep specialist, but i'm not sure how to get the help i need, especially in times where we're dealing with a global pandemic. please help me. i feel like this is the only place where i can find refuge in hopes that someone will take me seriously.
Signal	I'm using very small dosage of ami to help with chronic pain and also to help with insomnia.Unfortunately, I feel **very** drowsy and sleepy the rest of my day, even if I had 10-11 hours of sleep.So, in a way, it helps me to sleep, but probably the quality of this sleep sucks.DAE has similar experience? Or your sleep quality was good with amitriptyline?
NotSignal	You're finding yourself awake, pretty much given up trying to rest at this point. So, what's the challenge for today? Good luck, you will be alright and I wish you the best. ♡
Signal	After browsing for the past couple days it seems my insomnia is here to stay TBD. I’ve had a week so far of not being able to fall asleep until around 7am, melatonin hasn’t helped, and Ambien puts me out for about 3 hours but I’m trying my best not to take it consistently.The only change in my life I’ve recently experienced is starting an SNRI. It has done wonders for my anxiety, and the insomnia started about 2 weeks after increasing my dose the recommended dosage.What helps you? What would you tell someone that’s just now having a streak of their life’s worst insomnia?Thank you and may you all rest well.. eventually.
Signal	I had insomnia really bad as a teen and young man. It's been almost ten years since it's been bad, although I have had weeks that sucked before. The last few months, I've had a very strange sleeping pattern. I can't sleep Saturday/Sunday through Tuesday, but Tuesday-Friday I'm able to sleep a normal 6-7 hours. Maybe because I'm older now, but I it seems I'm tireder than I was back when I didn't sleep at all.Anyone else have sleep schedule like this?
Signal	The night before last, I didn't sleep. The night after, I slept for a wonderful 10 hours. Now, I'm awake at 3am again, scared for another sleepless night. I'm 13, I'm a wreck and my insomnia is completely taking over. How do I get to sleep right now?
Signal	I've always been a light sleeper. My mom said I never napped as a baby and starting in highschool is when my insomnia really started. (I actually think I have sleep apnea- my dad was the exact same way- slept maybe 4 hours for years till he was diagnosed) Anyway, I digress. Eating and insomnia- so being vain and all, I was trying to do intermittent fasting, which meant eating between certain times instead of all day. I'm loosing weight while doing this, but almost immediately I start loosing sleep. Even staying awake all night. So last night at 3am, while everyone else slept like babies (even the damn dog rolled over annoyed that I was tossing and turning) i decided to do some research: is there a link to eating and sleep patters?And there is!Appariently our bodies have 2 circadian rythems. One we know about- based on sun rise and sun set. The other that is never talked about is when we start eating.Our bodies appariently think that whenever our first meal of the day is, should be the time we break our fast- meaning the first meal we eat after sleep. And will adjust accordingly. Appariently people who travel from one time zone to another, reset their sleeping patterns by fasting for 16 hours then eating their first meal whenever they want to "wake up" and then their bodies adjust accordingly.If this is true, then could if be that my habits of eating not till later in the day is what is throwing my sleep? I've never ate breakfast (hated eating early) so I always would eat at lunch, which would explain why I sleep so good in the morning.There may be no correlation. It could be a reach, but i do wonder
Signal	This. Is. Fucked.I. Am. Fucked.I'm fucking exhausted. It's legit 4am night 3 of no sleep. At all. I'm exhausted. But so awake at the same time.I can't lay still. I can't get comfortable. I've got 4 fucking songs in my head at once plus a bunch of other shit that won't shut up. I've tried mindfulness.I've tried breathing exercises.But I can't focus on any.It's like I'm hyperalert or some shit. Every damn noise is amplified. And my ears are ringing on top of that.I'm exhausted but ready to jump up and run at any moment.This whole fight or flight anxiety shit is not needed. I have no reason to feel anxious. All I want to do is fucking sleep.How do i make this brain of mine shut the eff up??? I'm at breaking point...
NotSignal	What do you do when you find yourself in this situation? I’m in this predicament a lot and I never know what to do. I hate missing the day and sleeping all day. Sleeping all day keeps my sleep schedule backward (I also have DPSD) but when I force myself to stay up all day I feel sick and moody.
Signal	I’ve struggled with insomnia my whole life but recently it’s been so much worse. I just started a new job after three months of being in quarantine. During quarantine I got on a bad sleep schedule but i’ve also never been so well rested in my life. Now that i’m back to an 8-5 schedule I’m having a really hard time adjusting. I’m a full time nanny to kids with special needs so I desperately need energy to keep up with them during the day. I’m exhausted and can barely keep my eyes open but I can’t flip the switch to sleep. I struggle with severe anxiety and sleep deprivation makes it hard to manage my mental health. I’ve tried every natural supplement or over the counter medication I can think of, my doctor gave me some pills but everything just makes me over tired. I feel like my body and mind are dying and I just need to know that i’m gonna be ok and this is not the end of the world.
Signal	So I've suffered from insomnia for like 3/4 years from around 14 all the way till around 4 months ago. I've been doctors multiple times about it and recieved the same shitty advise that you get almost always "it's your sleep schedule, look after your sleep hygiene". I ended up getting so frustrated one time after going to the doctors and hearing the same thing, from the same doctor twice in 2 weeks I just gave up on them. 4 months ago I started smoking weed and my insomnia was instantly gone, i had no sleep issues whatsoever and it was amazing. Now heres where its turning south again, I'm starting to notice the ill effects of cannabis use at 17 already. Decreased cognitive ability day after smoking, head fog etcetera and now I decided to stop. First night, couldnt sleep again. Second night, couldnt sleep. Now 3 weeks in and on average i sleep 12/15 hours per week. GUYS WHAT CAN I DO IM LITERALLY IN A CATCH 22
NotSignal	I have no friends, I have poor social skills, this makes my family think I don’t like people and They always say stuff like they would never wanna be friends with someone like me :( I don’t know what to do anymore
Signal	Two days in a row now I’ve been waking up and not able to go back to sleep. Who is this same problem and who has gotten out of it?Ignore the “ppl”, I’m tired and Idk what I wrote there
Signal	2 months ago i had a really hardcore anxiety problem for two weeks. So i had insomnia too. Went to a psychiatrist and started to use medicine. It finished my anxiety problem but insomnia still goes on. I don't use any medicine for sleep and my doc said im too young(19 M) to use sleep pills. Also he said that this problem will disappear in near future. Initially i was really anxious about sleep but now i think i can live with that. So for me its hard to fall asleep and waking up 2-3 times each night. But also my doc said that my sleep problem continued a bit long. So i want to ask that, is there any person who lived something like this? Have you got any idea about my situation?
Signal	At night I feel productive and want to draw, write music or do other things. But during the day I get random moments where I suddenly fall asleep?¿ I don't get it why is my brain like this. It's 2:22 AM as I'm writing this, it's raining outside, I feel manic and cannot get myself to feel tired. My insomnia is only making my psychosis worse and it never got proper treatment or looked into even though I've been having sleep issues since I was born.
NotSignal	Good ole 1st shift 5am start tune 4am wake up, honestly tried going to bed at 8pm yesterday browsed phone and just layed in my thoughts till I looked at clock and saw it was 1am.. Maybe only 3 hrs of sleep but today I’m gonna try something different
NotSignal	Im having a video call with a doctor tomorrow to attempt to get a pill prescription (only to use it temporary) & idk why but i’m so scared he’s not going to take me seriously, just like my GP or everyone else. I don’t want to be told to “try meditation, exercise more, have you done this or that...” because I already did and it’s not working.
Signal	So, I've been an insomniac for more or less 4 years and I usually sleep 1/4 hours, sometimes (very often, according to my boyfriend) I don't get any sleep and I can continue like that normally for the rest of the day, and sleep like 2/3 hours next night. The thing is, when I sleep more than 6 hours I feel very tired and sleepy the whole day.Why do I feel sleepy if I sleep as long as I should, and so active when I don't sleep at all or very little?
NotSignal	My body often has a hard time falling asleep at night - it take hours pretty regularly. I often feel caffeinated (even though I don't drink caffeine). It's also not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night or wake up too early and not be able to fall asleep.However, one of the worst parts, is that no matter how much sleep I get, I can NEVER nap during the day. No matter how hard I try. So I'm just awake feeling absolutely miserable until night - then I'll see if my body feels like it wants to sleep or not...It's maddening.
NotSignal	Hello! Not sure what's wrong but I figured I'd ask some people that also can't sleep. It seems like I'm ready to fall asleep but hit something like a mental wall that is preventing me from FULLY falling alseep. Does anybody else have this problem or have any solutions?
Signal	I feel so dumb writing this but over the past week or so it literally feels like I've forgotten how to sleep. My sleep schedule has always been pretty terrible, but it's been progressively getting worse until I was sleeping around like 5-7am and waking up at 2pm. However now it feels like I can't even sleep at that time. I think this was due to staying up a night to try and reset my schedule, but then the next night going to bed at 11pm and not being able to sleep at all until like 6. I kinda just lay there with my eyes closed for an hour and not sleeping, on repeat. I know this is most likely an anxiety thing, worrying about not being able to sleep but anytime I try the anxiety is always in the back of my mind, worried that I won't sleep again. I'm now up again at 4am after trying to sleep for a few hours and only getting an hour of sleep yesterday. Any ideas on how to combat this? I realise that I look at my phone right up until I go to sleep which is pretty bad but I've been doing this for years so I'm not sure if that'd suddenly be a reason for not being able to sleep. My days recently haven't been eventful at all, just doing nothing all day until I sleep, could this be a reason? I feel so lost in what to do and this just makes my anxiety worse about sleeping If anyone reads this at all thank you
Signal	Hi guys! So I've recently started dating someone with Insomnia. We met on Animal Crossing so it's long distance.She stays awake all night, and sometimes I sacrifice my sleep to spend time with her, then we sleep in the day (Quarantine am I right?) However, she's dealing with depression, and she sleeps erratically. Sometimes she's up for 4 days, sometimes she's yo-yo-ing between piss poor sleep and lethargy.Do you guys have any tips on how to improve the situation? I know she can't control it, but we both feel strongly about each other, and want to come up with ways to overcome this hardship. I've been writing her special messages and poems or drawings while she sleeps so she has something to wake up to.Any other tips would be awesome. What's something you'd want your S.O to do for you while you slept?
Signal	My sleepless nights started about 3 weeks ago, i got bad anxiety from it and went to the psych ward where they gave me zopiclone, which worked like a charm, but as soon i came off it everything got bad. Im only sleeping in maximum 1 hour intervals and its woth vived dreams to follow.Ive also begun feeling like i have mental decline, i have memory problems galore and cant seem to remember names of people or things anymore, my thoughts are messe and i feel unable to pull anything coherent out of them.i feel foggy mentally and i dont want to do anything except lay in bed, ive also been ha ing dizzy spellsIve been represcribed zopiclone, i took it yesterday and it worked like a charm but this night its been about 2 hours sincei took it and nothing. Im so incredibly anxious at this point and scared thati have mere lonths to live and much less time to actually enjoy.At this point i just really need someone to tell me that im not dying, and that this is going to pass.Can anyone relate? Can sleep meds just magically stop working? Does anyone fall asleep in small 1 hour intervals, have vivid dreams, and cant tell if theyre sleeping or not most of the time?
Signal	I’ve been taking melatonin for a long time, and slowly increasing my dosage on it. I’ve been recently taking 10-20mg a night and I’ve come to terms with the fact it just isn’t working. I randomly picked some sleep medicine thing off the shelf, called Genexa I think? __And I ended up falling asleep at about 10:30pm!!!!__That’s a total victory for me.I woke up an hour earlier than I wanted to, and couldn’t fall back asleep though. Usually I stay asleep all night and can’t get up in the morning at all, so it was very weird. An hour early didn’t bother me though, I guess my body isn’t used to getting so much sleep.
NotSignal	I haven't had an 8+ hour sleep in months probably years. No matter how early I sleep, I end up waking up after 3-5 hours and I can't get back to sleep. I am losing it. I'm not sure if I actually have insomnia or if it's just my living situation. I live in a 4 bedroom house with 6 people (parents, 3 siblings and sibling's partner). Me being the youngest, I don't get my own enclosed room so we turned one of the living room into a room where I sleep. This room has no doors and is right next to the kitchen. Sibling 1 goes to work at 3am. Sibling 2 at 5am. Dad at 6am. Mum comes home at 8am. Sometimes someone will be cooking between 10am-1pm. AND I HEAR EVERYTHING. Even with ear plugs. They know I have issues with noise while I sleep but I can't really expect everyone to change and live their lives according to my sleep schedule.I'm 26 and people will probably just say to move out. But I can't really afford to and "moving out" isn't really part of our culture. It's common for families to stay together there whole lives in one house. Also I don't think it's fair that the youngest should move out before the oldest. Lol.Thoughts? Should I just get some pills? I've tried sleeping with pink/white/brown/black noise. It doesn't work for me. I need complete silence.
NotSignal	I havn’t gotten any sleep for too long now, I don’t know why it happened, it just happened, before quarantine I was sleeping fine but now I get very little sleep in a week, today I am running on six hours of sleep from two days ago. Aparrently Insomnia runs in my family so I don’t know what to so
Signal	Does anyone else try to sleep only to not sleep for 10 minutes and then check their phone and notice it's 3 AM?It's like, you thought you didn't fall asleep but there's NO WAY that much time passed.I find it funny but anxiety is hitting me because of it and now I can't sleep for real and I'm hella tired with the worst headache ever lol
NotSignal	I hate my life. I hate my family, I just feel like I have my mother, all my family (dad, brothers and nephews) disappoint me more and more every day. I hate my fucking life, I just want to get out of my house, but I don't have money because I don't work, I just study (I'm in college and I don't like my career), I'm 21 years old, I don't know what to do anymore, every day I suffer from anxiety, depression and much more. Lately I have suicidal thoughts, I only have my mother and my puppy.
Signal	So basically two days ago I slept for 1 hour and so yesterday I thought it I would try to fix it and I slept @10pm I couldn’t fall asleep so I told my dad when he was awake I’m having difficulty sleeping nd if he can help. He got pissed off and he said I’m making all this up and shit and that I’m making it worse for myself and told me too read out loud for an hour at a time and then he would send me to my room and give me 30min to sleep if I didn’t then he would make me read for 1hour again. We did this for 3hours. I love reading but I don’t like readying out loud when I have one hour sleep and my eyes are burning, so I dreaded this every 30mins. so then my dad said not to use my phone or pc tmrw (my mum let me use It for a little) becuz he thinks that the phone or pc showhow is making me more spoiled and it’s becuz I’m spoiled I can’t sleep. I’m entering a depressive state where I can’t stop crying and I’m dreading this reading process. Idk man I’m scared to take melotonin and my fam don’t understand. I’m on the verge of braking and just starting a whole out brawl with my dad. He isn’t a decent human being. I’m done. Hope you all sleep well ✌️.
Signal	Just a mini rant here as I lay awake....as usual....But does anyone take this medicine? I am prescribed it at a low dose and it really is the only one that works for me but I feel soooooo hungover I cannot work productively the day after.Melatonin makes me feel crazy and doesn’t work ever. Restoril only lets me sleep 4 hours. Xanax and Clonazepam are the only others that work and my doc is a jackass who literally would rather me suffer from insomnia and disturbed sleep then help me. Just wondering if anyone has any other suggestions ?I am in great physical shape. Run every day. Lift weights every day. Try reading before bed. No tv or laptop but man this is so frustrating.........Anyways back to sitting in the dark drowning in thoughts :(
Signal	My friend has struggled with not sleeping since she was a child (now early 20s). Sleeping pills don't work for her (only valium) and I'm pretty sure it's anxiety/PTSD related. She refuses to see a therapist or go to a sleep clinic..... What other ways are there for her to get help? She can't see a way out of it and always just refuses any of my suggestions. Have any of you recovered from your sleeping issues that were related to anxiety/PTSD and if so, how? thanks!!
NotSignal	Some years ago i felt like a mass going through my head then i started to forget things easier and i barely can remember of things that someone told me to do 10 seconds after it and i cant focus in anything, what could it be ? I'm afraid to say that to psychiatrist and have to take more medicines with me.
NotSignal	it’s 5:15 am. My whole body is shattered. I have work at 9 and have my alarm set for 8. Why.Why can’t i just sleep.I had a somewhat normal sleeping pattern back for a while but boom it’s back. Lovin it
Signal	I'm a 20 M recently I 'v been dealing with IBS and some anxiety/depression i'v had some horrible nights and the night after i got to sleep for like 4-5 hours and wake up feeling like it's been 8 hours or something ( while feeling tired and sleepy AF ) and being unable to get back to sleep, i was hoping to see if others went through this
Signal	You know how when you make a fried egg you keep the yolk whole so when you eat it its all like nice and runny.I have been making fried eggs for years on years now but also I've been using eggs in various other recipes and always had no problem with leaving the yolk whole.But the other day I was making a fried egg and while I was breaking the egg the yolk broke. I am not a fan of scrambled eggs so I tossed it out and tried again, and again the yolk broke so I tried again, I've tried four times before giving up, each time the yolk broke and I tossed it out. I still make fried eggs every few days but even though all of that happened around 4 or 5 months ago I still cannot make a fried egg on the first try.You know I either hit the shell too hard or not hard enough, or I hit it on a too flat of a surface or too pointed of a corner but I cannot bring myself to break an egg without breaking the yolk even though I've been doing it since I was a toddler.It's like I lost the confidence in my ability to break an egg and now I'm trying my best to not fail at it but it's only making it worse.It's 6:00 am rn, I haven't slept through the night in around 2 weeks because every time I notice I am about to fall asleep and I wake right up. The last few days I didn't even allow myself to start and fall asleep. I just pass out during the day for an hour or two.and I didn't know how to explain this even to myself until I remembered my egg story, I've lost confidence in my ability to fall asleep.I don't know if I really suffer from something or am I just being dramatic... But for god's sake, I just want my fried eggs back, it was such a healthy breakfast.
Signal	So I have insomnia that keeps me up for hours before falling asleep then my body clock always wakes me up early. Getting 4-5 hours of sleep I consider decent nowadays. Its very rare that I have uninterrupted sleep. Ive been scared of getting sleeping pills due to the side effects of it and possibly becoming addicted but getting poor sleep seems to be worse. So if I was to get proscribed pills, would it be fine to only take them 1-2 times a week without having side effects?
NotSignal	I’ve always had issues sleeping, but over the last few years a new issue has occurred. The issue is when I do manage to fall asleep I find myself in this weird half awake state. My day job is one that is very monotonous and filled with small tasks. When I get in this state I feel like I’m in a continuation of the day prior. I’m always doing all the same things I would do while working and such. I feel like I’m really doing all the things that I’m doing in this dream. It’s the most hyper realistic feeling dream I’ve ever had. When I manage to rouse myself and realize it was some sort of dream state I feel exhausted and my head hurts. Recently it has been happening several times a night and preventing me from feeling like I ever really sleep. Has anyone ever had a similar experience? Any advice? I need help.
Signal	I never used to have problems staying asleep at night though, recently I have noticed I routinely wake up 1-2 times a night around 3 or 4 hours apart from each other. This has never been a problem before quarantine started so I have to ask.. Can maintenance insomnia be caused simply by having a messed up sleeping routine??I used to go to sleep at 10pm every night to wake up for school at 6am and I always got a full nights rest. Ever since quarantine I’ve been going to sleep at 12-2am and waking up at 7 but never getting full deep sleep. If any one has experience with this and can tell me how to fix this please, I have been trying to sleep earlier (11pm) and this hasn’t helped one bit. Might have gotten worse. I have tried melatonin (made it worse), turning off devices 1 hour before bed (didn’t help), and now the only option I have would be replicating my old sleep routine going to sleep at 9pm but something tells me that couldn’t be the problem or could help considering it’s only one hour earlier and I used to have poorer sleeping habits anyway despite going to bed early.Please give me any advice if you see something here that I can’t or won’t let my self see, thank you :).
Signal	My doctor recommended Trazodone for sleep, I got a bottle of it. I have pretty bad imsomnia from anxiety and sometimes get panic attacks/mind races the more I stress over sleep. Will this stuff work? Anyone know if it works for anxiety/insomnia? Thanks
Signal	I have anxieties issues. Today when I go to bed I was extremely tired then anxieties hit me and I don’t feel the need to sleep because I am not tired. Is there a term or explanation for this?
NotSignal	I'm having this issue I've had for a long time now. Whenever I sleep (my definition) of early, like 10 or 11pm, I ALWAYS wake up at like 1 or 2pm or some point in the night.This happens most of the time. The only time I can exempt is if I'm really exhausted like when I went on a trekking trip and also if I'm really sleep deprived.My usual bed time has always been late, when I was a kid my parents really struggled with me to sleep, I can't remember my life without insomnia.It's so frustrating though as I'll be super tired for once, sleep early then wake up really restless?? Then I don't get a good night sleep anyways. Its almost as if my body is like, ah yes, a nice NAP.I know there's the whole 'gradually being back your body clock' method but I can't control when I can sleep so I dont see it working. I have looked into possible sleep phase disorder?
Signal	Ive battled with insomnia bad ever since i was 19, i quit seroquel successfully in january, and it was the hardest thing id ever done. I cannot begin to explain the hell that is withdrawal from quetiapine. I went cold turkey off alcohol addiction (approximately 1/2 handle per night for 2 years) and the withdrawal from S made that look like wonderland.I made it 2.5 months before going back on it due to getting about 1-2 hours sleep, looking back, I was i hadnt continued taking it starting April 21. Now my bodies addicted to it and im up to 300mg wondering what to do next.My psych is a pill pusher for antipsychotics and Ads. I dont feel comfortable asking her for Ambien but would much rather take a drug like that then seroquel, because the side effects are UNBEARABLE for me. All i do is lay around all day, and im not myself anymore. I just want the old me back again. I went as far as to purchase Etizolam to use in the future when I quit, but Id rather have something stable to use as benzodiazepines are not something im looking for daily, only as needed.Lets chat about this, i feel trapped
Signal	I wanna sleep so bad. But I feel like I just did 60 different drugs I'm anxious as shit and all hyped up. Someone run me over
NotSignal	I was doing well for a couple months bit the past 2 and a half weeks I'm running on max 3 hours of sleep, and it isn't solid sleep. Sleeping pills have not helped. Avoiding caffeine has not helped. Exercise has not helped... Here's to my alarm for work going off I less than an hour and a half. Cheers folks.
NotSignal	I think my personal trick is not even thinking about sleeping until I physically start falling asleep. I came home around 1 am and already knew I wasn’t tired enough so I made chicken nuggets and watched TV until 3 am, ran into my roommate who also had trouble sleeping, talked for a bit and when I was starting to doze off while she was talking I knew I could finally go lay down. Fell asleep at 5 and woke up at 12! First time getting more than 3 hours straight in 6 days. When I woke up I started crying from happiness lol
NotSignal	I am able to sleep around 3,5-5 hours. When i wake up after 5 hours I don't like idea going back to sleep cause then I will easily oversleep. Is it good idea to hold onto time when i go to sleep and hope that I am becoming sleepier every day and start getting longer stretch from main chunk?
NotSignal	So I just met my co-worker / good friend at work. After we were done with our meeting she kept telling me how she hasn't slept so well the past days."I hardly slept last night. I had such a terrible night sleep.""Oh yeah?""Yeah, I had like only 7 hours. It was terrible."Meanwhile I am thinking... Wtf?! I can't even remember the last night I had 7 hours of sleep.Can anybody relate?
Signal	This medicine seriously is a god send for my sleep but I’m having a problem i take a whole one at night and it knocks me for out 12 hours. Im tired and groggy when i wake up. I was thinking i should just take half of one , can I do this? My psychiatrist office is closed on weekend so i cant contact her
Signal	Hello, I'm (29M) new to this sub.For the past five years or so, I've always thought I was special for being able to sleep for five hours per night. I don't recall using my alarm clark to wake me up because I usually wake up between 4:30 to 5:00 in the morning automatically. But now that I am of this age, I am scared that I should really be getting more sleep than this. The same thing has been happening to me in the past couple of years: I sleep at around 10:30 pm and then wake up at around 3:30 am and I cannot fall back asleep most of the time. Sometimes, I get back to sleep within an hour or so then wake up after a couple of hours.I have some form of health anxiety that is why I am worrying about this again. I feel that my health is slowly fading because I don't get enough sleep. I keep reading stuff on the Internet that having less than eight hours of sleep will lead to severe problems. It's 3:45 am from where I am now and I cannot sleep again. I've been trying melatonin per night but it doesn't seem to help. I usually have no problem falling alseep in the evening. My problem is staying asleep for more than 4 - 5 hours per night and then falling BACK asleep. :( I've a runner and it keeps my anxiety at bay. But now I'm thinking of stopping it because it might lead to some heart problems because of my lack of sleep. :(Please, has anybody been through this kind of insomnia and found a solution to it? I just wanna know there's light at the end of the tunnel without me dropping dead from cardiac problems brought about by this. :(
NotSignal	I feel like a zombie my body is shutting down I feel hopeless the psychiatrist don’t answer I feel miserable I feel dead I’m stuck in an endless loop I’m alone again
Signal	Last night and two nights ago, I had panic and anxiety essentially all night. I kind of remember anxious intrusive thoughts as I lay down in bed, then I'd drift off and not really be able to remember what I'd been thinking or doing, like I was in a twilight state much of the night. Sleep tracker said I slept for 30-45 minutes at a time, but I don't believe it.I'm exhausted and feel like I didn't sleep at all...it would be nice to think that I got at least a little sleep. I'm a groggy zombie atm.
Signal	Strange things have been going on for a while. On July, I started to suffer from fragmented sleep. I could only make it through 1,5 hour after which I woke up. Though it wasn’t difficult to get to sleep once again, my inability to sleep through the night without that many interruptions quite irritated me. I wouldn’t say I felt terribly sleepy during the day, but some sort of tiredness occasionally turned up. Furthermore, I wasn’t quite sharp cognitively. A month later, the dynamics seemed to be changing. I could sleep for 3 hours without waking up in the middle of that time. But it became harder to fall asleep. I made a mistake then. My doc prescribed me some trazodone, and I, stupidly, decided to take it in before sleep to make things even better. Initially, it was only 25mg which was of no help. Then I doubled the dosage, still to no avail. I’d say that the time I was using trazodone was the most terrible in my life in terms of sleep. Side effects, no sleep, negative emotions. So, I stopped it. The next night being clean from trazodone I managed to sleep for 4,5 hours interruption free + was able to get to sleep after that in no more than 10 minutes. This dynamics seems to have been stable for several days now. The question I want to ask is, wtf? Why was it so? Also, there’s a thing to add: for several years except for the period mentioned above, I’ve had this middle-night sleep interruption (easily go to sleep thereafter). Is that normal at all?
NotSignal	i sleep very well in the past i sleep the same time every single day and i will Fall a sleep in 10 minute but now i just suddenly can’t Fall a sleep i Can you guy help me.
NotSignal	I use to walk three miles home everyday from highschool, while I was either sleeping 3 hours a night or not sleeping at all. This lasted 2 years. My knees and ankles were basically inflamed during the entire week and I would still walk on them. Now they are in pain even when I don't move them.
NotSignal	Here’s some practical information which you can action to get some sleep:[overcoming insomnia](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-overcome-insomnia-1/answer/Al-Griskaitis?ch=10&share=ec17c2a1&srid=sumLd)
Signal	So I’m dealing with a cold and haven’t slept in over 24 hours. I have a pretty hectic day at work today and will have to chug DayQuil and coffee to even function. Do you guys have any tips on how to survive the day? And no, I can’t call in sick since this is a new job.On a side note, my doctor has prescribed me Pro Zopiclone but I’ve been too chicken shit to take it. I might try it tonight to see if it’ll help, although I’m starting to wonder if my chronic insomnia is anxiety induced.
Signal	Does anyone just have one of those days where all of your worries hit your body at once and you just can’t fall asleep? I take 4 different medications at night to help me fall asleep, and 7 times out of 10 it works. Even those days where I don’t drink any caffeine, get enough exercise, and go outside of my room, I still just have that one day where I can’t sleep, for no reason. Lately I’ve been “walking the line,” a little phrase I came up with where I’m too exhausted to do anything, but to awake to sleep, and honestly when that happens I think of just walking into the sea. Does anyone know why this happens? What can I do to prevent this from happening again?
Signal	Me with a diagnosed sleep disorder and sleep issues my ENTIRE life (no exaggeration. Ask my folks) tells my friend about my sleep problems.My friend who drinks 3-5 xl triple triples WITH a shot of espresso from Tim Horton's every day and well into the night: Yeah me too. I have insomnia! It really sucks!Ugh no you don't. You have bad sleep hygiene because you over stimulate yourself with caffeine and nicotine. People who compare themselves to those of us with actual sleep disorders when we can do anything and everything to try and sleep properly meanwhile they have horrible habits really irks me. It also makes medical professionals not take us as seriously because they can get used to their patients complaining about sleep issues that can be fixed with a few simple adjustments.
NotSignal	drug labels say do not take for longer than a week/2 weeks, but i've been using it for about a month whoopz, it helps me fall asleep in 1.5h instead of 3-5h, though idk if there's anything wrong with taking melatonin long-term, what if I become dependant on it?
Signal	I wake up and cannot fall back asleep. I went to a doctor years ago and was prescribed a sleeping pill that made things worse when I tried it. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Exercise, yoga, meditation, herbal supplements, acupuncture, therapy...I’ve slept through the night once that I can remember in the last 10+ years...I’m just venting. I’m facing another day on about 3 broken hours of sleep and I’m exhausted and cranky and want to just hide away. Thanks to anyone who reads.
Signal	Hello, I have recently decided to get off my sleeping pills. I stocked up on 10 mg melatonin, ZZ quil, and Valerien root. Last Night i probably slept Like 5 hours. What supplements do yall use or are you on sleep pills? Just curious how people sleep or try to sleep LOL.
NotSignal	Good sleep hygiene isn’t talked about enough. I have struggled for years to stay asleep. I can usually fall asleep easily enough but I can never sleep over 4 hours or so. Once I actually looked at my bedroom, I saw the clutter under the bed and cleaned that out. I cleaned completely all surfaces, and now they only have ‘essentials’ on them. I have blackout curtains. I take an epsom salt bath about 9:30pm (which is magnesium, I like it better then taking the magnesium capsule and it soaks right in), then change into clean pajamas. I put in earplugs if I’m in a noise-polluted area, if not I use white noise. In addition, I make sure the light is either non-existent or just enough so that I can see to get into bed. I used to fall asleep with my phone next to me. I started turning off the WiFi, then I started putting it on airplane mode. I do think that it makes a difference. Lastly, I looked into Feng shui - turns out my bed was facing the worst possible position for sleep. I moved the bed to the best position as indicated by Feng shui and it actually worked! I would’ve never thought that would work - but it has. I want to mention as well about the magnesium - if you are sticking to capsules, Magnesium Citrate or Glycinate works miles better than the Magnesium Oxide you usually see in stores. Different types of magnesium affect different parts of us, which I found interesting. I use the Pure Encapsulation brand. I hope that some of this can help someone. My sleep isn’t perfect but it has improved drastically.
NotSignal	Why am I stressing out over this?...is it always going to be like this? Is there no hope for me? Why is this a bad thing? So many questions, not enough answers. Why do I torture myself? Why can't I live a normal life? I'm not even with this person... why am I stressing? Is it lack of discipline? A weak mind? Too.much on my plate? What is it? Does it even have an answer? When will I be back to normal? Will.i ever be normal?
NotSignal	My sleep schedule was fucked up and I was sleeping for like 17 hours during the day, and I managed to finally fix it but now I’m sleeping from 12-4-5am and now after a quick google search I have insomnia? When I wake up I’m really anxious and my heart is usually beating quite fast. What should I do?Edit: Managed to get back to sleep at 5 and woke up at 9, but fuck me this is exhausting.
Signal	I finally feel like I am on the right track with seeing a psychiatrist and figuring out the right balance of meds, and things have been better over the last couple of weeks. I was diagnosed as having a "nonspecific hypomanic episode" which may eventually lead to a Bipolar diagnosis, and my psychiatrist put me on meds in accordance with this. Seroquel at bedtime, Lamictal in the morning, and Ativan as needed. Still working on the right doses and all that, but overall I have felt better. However, last night was a bad night that felt exactly like some of the nights I had before I was medicated at all. Couldn't get to sleep, mind racing with nonsense thoughts, strange visualizations in my mind that I believed were true (i.e. I unintentionally imagined that there was a man riding a bike in my room, and believed that if I opened my eyes it would be true; of course it was not, but that's the place that my mind was in), twitchiness, and just feeling so restless and agitated overall. I still feel better today than I have in the past after such nights, and I do believe that I got some sleep at some points, but this process is so frustrating. I have had medical tests to rule mostly everything out, so it really is most likely (if not 100% definitely) a psych issue that will take some time to balance out. I also just fear that something has been missed medically and that the psych meds are not the answer, but that is most likely my psych issue talking. Hoping others can relate to this.
NotSignal	What helps you get through the work day when your running on little to no sleep? And what methods have you used to help fall asleep? - avoiding any medication. I also appreciate there’s a small support group on here and I don’t feel alone. It’s very easy to feel that way when everyone else is able to get proper sleep and everyone tells you the same bs that you already know (melatonin, go to sleep early, don’t use your phone before bed- all methods I have done already) This has been happening for 2 months now and all I just want is sleep. Even if it’s only for 3-4 hours, it’s better than none. I appreciate any kind of advice and wish me luck I can get through this work day :(
Signal	I feel like I am at a constant battle against my brain. I feel like I am in constant torture. I can never sleep. It is affecting me emotions and feelings. I am so dull. During the day I can’t be happy because I don’t have the energy for it and I can’t think strait because my brain is fogged. Why can’t I have a normal fucking head thag dosnt make me go 3 days without sleeping. I’m tired as shit and can’t go the hell to sleep. Insomnia is a curse that makes me want to kill myself
NotSignal	In college, despite feeling a little low, I slept nicely the past two nights- though I wasn’t socializing as much. My mood gradually began to drop. Today I spent most of the day in the library, socially distanced behind a mask- never said anything outside a word or two to my roomates. As a Saturday night, I was constantly reminded how out of tune I was socially by the loud music, laughter, etc of the neighboring apartments. Beginning of my college was rough, so I really have no friendd outside my roomates whom I met just last semester- even they have picked up on how outcasted I am. I’ve also been rejected my most socially well-adjusted girls when they realize this- no one wants to be with a guy who isn’t a good “catch” and has no “tribe”.Anyway, as I first almost dosed off I was hit with a sleep paralysis nightmare and immediately woke up. Then I ruminated until 3am and fell asleep for 1 hour. My dream was about me being accepted back into my rugby team that I quit, coach smiling at me etc. Now I’m awake again. Moral of the story is to not undervalue the importance of social connection, even with those you feel like are “losers”. Not just talking, but building *connections* It could be through work as well, either way we need to schedule it as a part of our day because we need it as badly as we need to eat and breathe. If we try and go without this (as I have)- instead of hunger or suffocation- our mind is tortured and given depression making it very hard to sleep as well as everything much worse.
NotSignal	Ive struggled with sleep maintenance insomnia for the last 10 months but its been at it worst the latest 4-5 months and I decided to give cbt a try but so far it seems to only have made things worse. Has anyone been successful with this or is it time to try something else?
Signal	My (19) entire life that I can remember, I’ve never slept consistently well. I’ve never felt rested, there’s multiple times where I averaged getting about 4 hours a night for a month, and at most I can get one good nights sleep a week. Recently it’s been the worst it ever has been. My partner recently switched to third shifts, and I am a very routine driven person, so having her switch has fucked me up. I also work a first shift job where I’m at work by 6 am most mornings or 515 at the earliest. Im also encountering some stress outside of work with future job opportunities and some problems with federal aid for college. I’m getting at most 4 hours a night. I lay down at about 8:45, after going through my nightly routine, but I’m not able to fall asleep until maybe 12-1:00, and then I wake up at 430 and lay there until my alarm goes off at 500. I drink at most two cups off coffee in the morning. I’m emotionally dead, my speech impediments are returning, I’m forgetting things, and I just feel like I’m trapped in my own mental fog all day but I can’t sleep. It’s mostly stress driven and I’m trying to get those things sorted out, but the cycle of “I can’t sleep, so this stress is worse, so I can’t sleep” is always there. Does anyone have advice for how to deal with this? I’m so emotionally rundown from dealing with no sleep. I’m frustrated.
Signal	TW: Anger, self harm, and hatred towards self and Insomnia.I can't live like this anymore. I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna die from sleep deprivation I know it. I can't do this, I really can't. All these fucking stupid damn doctors can't fucking tell me what's wrong with me. They keep thinking it's bipolar disorder or something but I'm not doing anything that is productive. I CANT FUCKING SLEEP AT ALL! MY BRAIN WON'T FUCKIN TURN OFF! I'm so angry to the point of hurting myself...like go to sleep bitch! But I won't! It's just so frustrating. This isn't bipolar disorder this is very very bad insomnia. Am I gonna have to take Benadryl or Ativan forever?! I was supposed to have a sleep study and now I can't because of this stupid fucking virus! If I have bipolar disorder would be crying in desperation and frustration due to the fact that I can't sleep!? No! My stomach is having issues too because I'm probably supposed to get my period. I don't want sleeping pills, I don't want tranquilizers. You saw what happened to Michael Jackson. It's just that all these people on Reddit just think they know what they're talking about. Even if I do have bipolar disorder that doesn't mean I have really bad insomnia. I'm scared. I don't want to die yet. I haven't fulfilled anything yet. Not even finished school. My work and school and everything in my life is just shit because of my sleeping problems. This has to be really bad insomnia on top of really bad ADHD. Also, don't report me I'm just venting and frustrated as fuck!
Signal	I’ve had trouble sleeping for about three years (I’m 16 now). I’m afraid to go to sleep. As stupid as it may sound, when I try to sleep I either get hit with a major rush of anxiety, either I start imagining those gruesome monsters and faces, like there’s always some terrifying creature creeping into my room. It’s almost compulsive- it doesn’t matter how much I try to think happy thoughts, there’s always some underlying darkness in the back of my head that scares the shit out of me. It’s very hard for me to explain as I’ve never done it before, but I’ll try my best. It started when I was 13, some nights I would be so scared that I’d beg my sister to come sleep in my room. It faded out eventually and I got a few months of good sleep and than it came back, faded, came back and so on. A few months ago I had a few episodes of sleep paralysis which only added to my fear of going to sleep. The first episode I couldn’t move and I felt like someone or something was lifting my arms and my feet, when I looked I literally saw the clown from It with a big ass smile- I closed and opened my eyes and it disappeared, but I couldn’t move or scream. I kept “waking up” in my dream. I even got out of bed to go to my parents’ room, only to open my eyes again and find myself back in my bed. The next two episodes were fine, nothing scary. The thought of going to sleep and becoming paralyzed freaks me out, although it happened multiple times when I was going into a lucid dream and I handled it well. I’ve been staying at home for three weeks now because of the coronavirus. I completely messed up my sleep (started going to bed at 9 in the morning and waking up at 7 in the evening). In the past week I’ve tried to make it go back to normal so I tried to deprive myself of sleep and take a bunch of melatonin- didn’t work, I woke up in the middle of the night with a cold sweat and couldn’t fall back asleep. So I stayed up for 24 hours in order to make myself exhausted. I managed to go to sleep at 7PM and it actually kept going for three days. I woke up at 7AM everyday. And now here I am; it’s almost 6AM, I’ve been awake for 24 hours. I was tired almost all day, I couldn’t even look at my phone anymore because my eyes started closing but AS SOON as I hit the pillow I get a rush of anxiety and I’m suddenly not tired anymore. My heart rate increases, I get all sweaty and fidgety. I’ve been crying for three hours because everytime I’m close to falling asleep my body wakes up, it’s like an electric shock.What should I do about all of this and what’s causing it?I assume it’s something stress related, but during the day I’m actually very laid back. I have my fair share of stress but I usually don’t make a big deal out of it.
NotSignal	Hello. I've been struggling to fall asleep in normal hours for years now and wanted to know if sleep & relax teas can help?
Signal	I'm 17 and currently stressed out because the last 3 days I have gotten little to no sleep. Whenever I try to lay on my bed at night, my heart rate skyrockets and my chest feels quite warm, the warmth by itself isn't really bothersome, but the anxiety is like nothing I've ever felt before. Anxiety is probably the only cause tbh. Today I felt like shit and had some trouble breathing (shortness of breath), I told my dad and apart from telling me I'm being a moron, he told me that I should try meditation and controlling my anxiety. We are going to order melatonin and see what happens, I'm not going to a psychiatrist or anything of the sort because dad doesn't want me to depend on pills to sleep. Naps don't seem to work and I'm fed up. Last night was particularly bad, so bad I banged my head against the wall with rage, plz, I need some reassurance.
NotSignal	I just wanted to see if anyone could relate. I'm an average kid, except for the fact that I have a hard time falling asleep. On a regular basis, I have a lot of trouble sleeping, but for some unusual reason I find it easy to fall asleep during the day. This problem greatly affects my life and my ability to do a lot of my school work and even follow-through with my life. My teacher is constantly calling me out on falling asleep in class. I don't understand what is wrong and I don't understand what to do. My mother is constantly complaining that I am doing nothing to fix the problem and she is kinda disappointed. Since my sleep schedule is so messed up I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. Do you have anything that could help me?
Signal	So I've been having trouble sleeping on and off for about 2 years now? I vaguely remember having trouble sleeping during my teenage years as well but this lack of sleep associated with anxiety, I have noticed only since I joined med school. I have this problem only during exams and it tends to subside once I'm done with the exams. In between exams, it does occur on a few occasions....but those are rare and manageable. Ever since lockdown started, it's only been getting worse. I don't mind not sleeping, it's that anxiety and panic that comes with it that annoys me...I either can't fall asleep or I end up waking up after an hour or two. Each time this happens, I can feel my heart thumping and I start crying because I get so scared. It's very hard to be rational during these episodes and I'm trying my best to control it, but it's just getting worse everyday And I noticed this started when my grandmother had to be admitted in the hospital and I was the one staying with her the whole time. So my sleep schedule got completely messed up and that's when it started getting this bad. I've been trying to get in touch with a psychologist... but I'm just not able to find one willing to spend time to find out what this is. A doctor prescribed anti anxiety medication (a combination of clonazepam and propranalol) for 10 days. It didn't help at all...I don't want to take medication just yet because most of the times, I'm aware of what's triggering my episodes But now...I'm not sure what to do. It's just getting worse. Any advice?Tldr: insomnia on and off since 2 years which has gotten worse since lockdown... unable to deal with the panic and crying constantly. Any non medication advice to deal with this?
Signal	I have no acces to sleeping pills or teraphy right now. But I am exhausted and my only solution is to sit still for hours with eyes open spacing out untill I sleep unconciously some how. I also don't try to control my thoughts just let them come and go. I can't do much phisically because of sleep deprivation, anyway.
Signal	So I started my ambien prescription yesterday, 5mgs. I took it at like 9 and fell asleep within 2 hours (I had only gotten 5 hours of sleep total in the past 3 days so I was exhausted). I woke up several times (~6 or 7) but found it very easy to fall back asleep. Woke up at 6am this morning. Tonight I took my ambien at 9:45 and it’s now 2:30 am and I’m wide awake. I’m an incoming freshman at college and the first day of classes starts tomorrow. I honestly have no idea what to do or why the ambien didn’t work. If medication isn’t going to help me get sleep I really don’t see the point of living on ~2 hours of sleep per night. I was straight A student in high school but I honestly doubt I’ll be able to hold a single B in college if this keeps up. I’m so tired all the time and I also have ADHD so it feels like everyday is a struggle. I’ve gone several consecutive nights this month without sleeping & I’ve tried almost everything. Any suggestions? What even is the point anymore.
NotSignal	Getting close to the 1 month point of having trouble staying asleep and I think it's really starting to hurt me now, bad. Dizziness, headaches, sometimes blurry vision, fatigue, and just feeling like I'm gonna collapse at times. Which *should* be good for getting to sleep but at the same time, I often feel anxious, overstimulated and even if I try to rest over the course of a day, it doesn't seem to do any good. Can't do most of the things I'd normally do to cheer myself up without needing to lie down.I've seen a specialist twice at this point and they continue to be confounded, as they insist I'm one of the healthiest people they've ever seen with sleeping issues and can't find anything medically wrong besides the side effects of sleeplessness themselves. I've sought after a CBT and the first appointment is coming up, though I am afraid if it will do anything. Really I'm just scared in general - each time I finally get the feeling of "yeah, this will be what fixes it", it never happens. I just want this to end, but if my condition keeps worsening I worry for what might happen.
NotSignal	There are nights that for example I wake up at 5:50h, I need to wake up at 7:30 so I try to sleep more, but then I wake up at 7:00-7:10, this is normal?
Signal	Is it possible for it to get worse? And can insomnia cause headaches because as it got worse I get more headaches and some dizziness.Is this a normal thing or should I see someone?
NotSignal	I would like to share this cuz it has helped me so much! When I couldn't sleep I used to use my phone, but the light would affect my sleep even more. Then I tried listening to ASMR or music. It has helped for a while but I got bored of it later on and would go back to using my phone. Few days ago, I was listening to podcasts in bed. Then I suddenly fell asleep. I think it is because listening to podcast doesn't require looking at the screen, and at the same time it's interesting enough to make me not go back to using my phone. I just hope this would continue working! Of course this might not help everyone as no everyone has the same problems (e.g. their problem might be difficulties in staying asleep).
Signal	Last night I took 3.75mg at 3:20 am and I was just browsing reddit waiting to feel sleepy and then next thing I remember is waking up at 6am. I don’t remember falling asleep. I take zopiclone since nearly 6 months now (not daily anymore) and it’s the first time this is happening to me. Is it a common effect?
NotSignal	Am I alone? Or do others get really hungry later in the night when it’s usually time to sleep? Just enjoyed a delicious Portuguese roll with butter. Now I’m already thinking of what else to snack on 😳
NotSignal	I can usually lucid dream and change the trajectory of my dreams but last night I had some truly horrific ones. Nothing I did in the dream changed where it was going or woke me up, and I still have a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm terrified to go to sleep. I don't have anyone to talk to that won't just do the pity thing. I don't want pity or a condescending "I'm sorry," I just want camaraderie and understanding.
NotSignal	Can insomnia be cured for real? Not put in remission, not just getting better, cured. No sleep aids needed, no medication, no night routine, no nothing? I was always a normal sleeper, I never had to worry about falling asleep, I never had to worry about waking up during my sleep. I was falling asleep watching movies on my laptop that was so close to my face, I would fall asleep chatting. Then I had to take antihistamines and after stopping them my insomnia started and 5 weeks later it's still here. Some nights are worse than others, but every night is insomnia related. I have never gotten back to my normal sleep. So, can it be cured?
Signal	Not to be confused with CBD. Here's a short writeup:CBN, or Cannabinol, is an oxidative degradation product of THC. It may be caused by improper storage or curing and extensive processing. It forms when THC is exposed to UV light and oxygen over time. CBN contains some psychoactive properties, about 10% strength of THC.Some researchers believe that CBN enhances dizziness and disorientation effects that a user may experience. Research has also found that it reduces heart rate and may cause feelings of grogginess.CBN’s best attribute is its sedative effect. According to @Steep Hill Labs, 5mg of CBN is as effective as a 10mg dose of diazepam, a mild pharmaceutical sedative.Has anyone personally tried CBN and can comment on their experience?
Signal	I know that’s basically the point, but the excruciating pain of insomnia is so unbearably lonely it makes me super depressed.Sometimes I shame myself for not sleeping, like “why can’t you do something so natural?” and then I remember brains can be too powerful sometimes when they unnecessarily need to be.
NotSignal	Mini rant but I’m a full grown adult, I have actual medication I take for this, and I’m not looking for advice from people who clearly don’t have insomnia. I wish people understood that telling them the existence of a mental health condition is not an invitation for them to offer advice. Often times we are just disclosing this so people don’t assume we’re up late partying. It’s like they don’t understand we can sit in bed for 2 hours and not sleep at all.
NotSignal	A lot of us browse this subreddit when we're deep in the throes of a bout of insomnia. They DO tend to pass, but often what we need is a bit of encouragement from others that they actually do. For me, I've been off and on good and poor sleep for the past few weeks. Had a week and a half of junk sleep (3-4 hours), then a week and a half of good sleep, now a couple of days of junk sleep again. Currently taking an SSRI for anxiety/depression, as well as melatonin, valerian tea, and some CBD oil at night. For me, it tends to be that during stretches of insomnia, what actually works is tackling the anxiety head-on, and the sleep tends to take care of itself in time.What about you all? What has helped you in the past? What has given you relief?
NotSignal	So I saw this thing on Instagram called cloudy. It’s like a melatonin vape and people said it works well. I don’t vape but really I’ll try anything now. Has anyone ever scene these in stores or is it online only? Any experience would be cool.
NotSignal	Sleeping at like 11pm then waking up 2,3, or 4 pm everytime. Then I struggle to go back to sleep, right now I woke up hitting my right hand into something. Is this maintenance insomnia or just my mind used to waking up like this? 2 weeks ago my circadian rhythm got fucked and it was hard for me to fall asleep and stay asleep, but now it's only hard for me to stay asleep.
NotSignal	When I first started having troubles sleeping I found this random Youtube channel by a Sleep Physician named Daniel called Insomnia Insight cant link due to reddit making mods have to approve, he has been doing this for like a couple years now and has very little subscribers or views but the knowledge is valuable as heck. Great for dealing with anxiety really do find him calming before I go to bed lol. He has really useful playlists i've pretty much watched all of his videos as well as actually talked to him on a video which I thought was really nice.dude genuinely deserves more views
Signal	I’ve been taking 25mg of Benadryl to sleep for years and was even combining with CBD, melatonin, HTP, etc. I’d always think I wasn’t a morning person as I was so groggy and needed tons of coffee to combat the effects in the morning.Since I’ve been in quarantine, I thought screw it and stopped cold turkey but still take melatonin and CBD. After about 2 weeks of horrible sleepless nights it’s somewhat regulated again! :-) I don’t sleep as well as I do on the Benadryl but I do get at least 5-6 hours of uninterrupted sleep! It’s all about small victories in quarantine lol
Signal	it’s almost like i’m too scared to fall asleep and therefore i’m not sleeping yet another nightdid this happen to any of you? i’m losing my mind
NotSignal	Hello fellow sleepless people. I usually limit my attempts to sleep at 4 hours (so basically four hours of lying down, eyes closed, trying to sleep). If I can't sleep beyond that, I usually get up and try to find something to do instead. What's your time limit?
Signal	Hello everyone. Here I am up yet again. I tried sleeping with my gf who snores. Her snoring triggers body flashbacks for me (childhood trauma). It’s been like this for over 2 months and this has caused me to enter a downward spiral in my well being. I’ve been seeing a therapist for 4+ years, I’ve tried tea, melatonin, valerian root, chamomile and lavender tea, relaxing essential oil baths, dark room, bought a fan, ear plugs, and now on hydroxyzine and yet here the fuck I am still because I can hear her through my ear plugs. She’s even wearing the nasal strips for snoring which has reduced it but I still woke up and heard her. Most of the time she sleeps right outside the bedroom and I can still hear her through my earplugs with the door closed! Like I don’t know what to do at this point. I want to sleep with my gf and I hate this. I hate my PTSD and this hyperarousal anxiety crap. I JUST WANT TO SLEEP LIKE A NORMAL PERSON!! Why does it seem like everyone else can sleep normal? 😭 Ever since I cut mirtazipine out of my life my insomnia has come back 3 fold! Do NOT take mirtazipine. It’s HELL!!
NotSignal	I'm looking for other people who share the same issues. Please respond if you find yourself positive to any one of the questions. Do you feel tired/grumpy/brainfoggy after waking up? Do you think of "trying to stop thinking" and spend 2h+ each day in order to have sleep? Do you sometimes feel conscious of your breath in such a way that you stop breathing? Do you think a LOT in general? Do you have a fucked up circadian rhythm?
Signal	Hi, everyone! First time poster.I have had difficulty sleeping as long as I can remember. I use MMJ which helps a lot but I am still waking up 3-4 times a night. I work in the mental health field, and I have a good grasp on drug interactions. But, for some reason, I am terrified of taking this med. Mainly due to seeing the side effects of hallucinating, nightmares/vivid dreams and feeling like a complete zombie the next day. I have taken .25 Klonopin as needed for ten years. Probably take one every two weeks. That’s a groggy I can handle, but this trazodone groggy sounds horrible. Plus, I have enough problems and I do not want to add hallucinations to that list. Lol.I am on Wellbutrin XL 300, so if anyone has taken both of these meds, please feel free to give input. I apologize that this has probably been asked a million times. Did you like trazodone? What symptoms did you have? Good/bad? Thank you everyone for your advice/help/listening. ❤️
Signal	I dont know why but whenever I actually try to get some sleep, I’ll start to doze off but then I get this feeling in the back of my head pop up that like someone is gonna try to kill me in my sleep and then I won’t be able to sleep for the rest of the night. I know it sounds childish as fuck but the only time I ever get a somewhat good amount of sleep is whenever I have a night light and I hate it. I just wish my brain would stop making me feel like Im in danger every 5 seconds
Signal	Hi guys, Does anyone know if this is a bad thing? I took a sleeping pill at 2am. It’s not almost 4am and I haven’t fallen asleep yet for whatever reason. I took 2 ibuprofen PM.
NotSignal	I was wondering if you guys have any tips for me (23F). I have GAD and PTSD where I also get period of times when I constantly dream about bad things. This time I keep getting chased, kidnapped and my family murdered whenever I close my eyes and sleep. I never have had it for so long and I am so tired lately. I cannot find any rest when I am sleeping yet I can't do anything else. I have about 1-3 dreams like this every night and I cannot stop them. So, I need to handle myself while I am so incredibly tired nothing seems exciting anymore
NotSignal	Its 3am. Baby has been soothed to sleep by her dad's snores.Everyone asks if the baby is sleeping through the night... But me? Hahahahahhahahha. Love insomnia. It doesn't take maternity leave.But seriously.... anything to sleep train yourself that doesn't involve sleep aids?
Signal	I'm not really looking for advice so much as just asking if others have experienced this, just to gauge how seriously I should take the correlation.So yeah. I have pre-existing anxiety, depression and OCD. I seem to notice a pattern whereby my symptoms are worse the day after I take doxylamine (12.5 mg). Not sure if they're connected but they do seem to be.If they are, this suuuuucks, because it is actually effective at getting me to sleep. Annnnd of course lack of sleep also makes my illnesses worse. So...awesome.
Signal	Hey r/insomnia,I'm trying to understand my insomnia and was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with a virus or illness causing insomnia.About two months ago I stopped sleeping for longer than 45 minutes and my nights became constant battles of 15-45 minutes of sleep at a time.At the same time I developed a light body rash in my chest and back, lost my appetite, and felt nauseous. The stomach problems resolved after two weeks, but the rash and insomnia have persisted.The rash and nausea are HIV symptoms, which I have since tested negative on multiple times with 4th gen and RNA testing.My doctor's suggestion has been to take Ambien and wait for things to improve, pausing on the Ambien on the weekends. The sleep is not improving, and the weird spotty rash I have appears occasionally.Anyone have any ideas? I feel like I'm losing my mind, and both my normal doctor and a second opinion I got have been useless...
Signal	Due to other health issues, I've started having to take many more medications. As a result, it seems like I'm suddenly starting to experience the side effects of zopiclone, and I want to get off of it. My sleep quality is poor, anyway.I've always eaten in the night here or there, assuming I was just hungry. Well, suddenly I'm eating like a horse in the middle of the night, sometimes not recalling ANYTHING no matter how hard I try (knowing only because I see wrappers and stuff in the kitchen). I'm starting to worry I'll do something like use a knife or get in the car... so I want to get off of it.I don't want to substitute it for anything else. I currently take other medications that have sleepiness as a side effect (though they don't make me sleepy), as well as melatonin. The combo of those, I'd like to think, may help me as I wean off of zopiclone.I am currently on 7.5mg (taking 11.25mg a few times only recently, but not doing that again). I take 5 to 10mg melatonin. My doctor suggested 3.75mg zopiclone + 5mg melatonin for a week, and then 0mg zopiclone and assessing the melatonin.Any support, experiences, or other tips weaning off? I have twice (recently) tried to sleep sans zopiclone, and did not sleep at all, literally, zero hours.My plan is to follow the doc's orders, I'm just nervous.
NotSignal	Gotta love tossing and turning all night and getting not a second of sleep! Sigh lol
Signal	My body feels like it’s going to collapse. Then when I get in bed. I’m laying there and my mind is awake. I don’t “fade” to sleep. Then I get up 4 hours later sweating. It’s not nightmares, it’s not sleep apnea. (Been rested) my gyno just shrugged. It’s not early menopause. I have no idea what could be keeping me awake. I’m on Hydroxyzine.
Signal	Has anyone here tried these two medications? I haven't had much luck with them. I still end up taking more stuff along either to help me sleep. Belsomra gives me a bad headache the next day, but it seems to help more than the seroquel. I'd love to hear yalls stories and what helps you sleep. I've been down a very dark road lately with insomnia and feel like theres no light at the end. Thanks!
NotSignal	I have been keeping my phone off after 8 and not doing anything thay requires my brain's "attention". E.g. not going on Facebook looking at peoples posts which may cause me to feel like I should respond, not checking email or playing games etc.I have been also turning lights off as much as I can around 830 in order to cue my body to know that its time to sleep.My question is: what are some common things we do that causes our body to have a stress response and can keep us from sleeping? Things that cause us to be "stressed" but we do them so frequently that we are not aware of them?
NotSignal	Hey !Is anyone using the Moona cooling pillow ? I see no review online but i got one and i must say it helps me sleep better. Was wondering if other people tried it here ?
NotSignal	Unfortunately my insomnia is back after I thought it was completely resolved :( but last night something weird happened. I had a freaking DREAM I was awake and tossing and turning in my bed... I wonder how many times I’ve dreamt this and thought I was awake but actually got some sleep, has this happened to anyone else???Also does anyone else sleep a little bit throughout the night but just get REALLY REALLY light sleep?? It’s so frustrating but it’s better than nothing so I guess I’ll take it
NotSignal	At around 8.15 pm, and now I am fully awake. Just...awake, and so fucking bored. For reference, it is 1.15 am. Fuck's sake. Insomnia is where madness sets in.
NotSignal	This isn't a guarantee for everyone, but after having an episode where I became hyper-aware of my heart beat and it freaked me out too much from sleeping, here's what's helped this week:* Cardio exercise* Eliminating coffee* Drinking water first thing when I wake up* Showering right when I wake up* Having more going on (work, hanging with friends, so on)Past few nights? Not as hyperaware of my heart rate, which relaxed me CONSIDERABLY.Ultimately that's been the culprit: over awareness of my heart beat? Not sleeping that night. The above has helped with that.
NotSignal	So basically my sleep scedule has been really off recently (i had a really important exam about 3 weeks ago and i was studying for it) and to try and fix it i would wake up earlier than i usually do and try my best to make it through the day, then i would fall asleep at a reasonable time so at about 12 to 2 am ( this is considered reasonable for me cause then if i slept about 6 or 7 hours i would be up by 8 or 9 am) but every single time i do this i always wake up 2 or 3 hours afterwards and not be able to sleep again untill about noon, and if i took a nap at 12pm i would only wake up at about 6 or 7 pm!!! This has happened so many times and im honestly sick of this and i dont know how to fix this
NotSignal	I think I’ve become nocturnal. If I finally get to fall asleep, it’s usually at 7-8am. I sleep until 5-7pm, and I only see a little bit of daylight. Then I sometimes interact with family members for a bit until they go to bed at 11. Then I’m alone. I’m pale (I used to be rather tan before) and I’ve developed substantial under eye bags. I only eat candy and snacks during the night in fear of getting yelled at from cooking at such late hours. We don’t have healthcare and frankly, I doubt I can see anyone about this with the pandemic situation.What do I do??
NotSignal	Its been weeks and it just keeps getting worse. It takes me hours to fall asleep and even when I do sleep I wake up 2-3 times over the course of it. It's fucking 6 am now so I've decided to just not sleep and hope that it will make me sleep tmw.
Signal	so i've had "insomnia" / big time sleeping issues for 4 months now almost, since this whole lockdown thing started, and i wouldn't sleep more than 2-3 hours a day if im lucky i get 4-6 hours once or twice a week, but now i ve managed to sleep 4-8 hours 4 days in a row.. how?1.I've took all my courage and worked out despite feeling like i have 0 energy and i would faint from exhaustion&#x200B;2. Went to uni(finally opened up again, going there 2-3 times a week now)&#x200B;3. i bought a sleepy time drink with high dosage valerian root, melissa and other things in it (its a bit pricy but i definetly like herbal supplements 20x more than chemicals which would make me feel like a zombie, no offense to those who take chemical meds, its just my experience after consuming half a tablette of antidepressants..)&#x200B;4. i kept my mind positive af no matter if i would sleep or not and i found myself waking up after 4+hours =)&#x200B;Hope this can help anyone who is struggling like me for some months now, and please don't get offended if you tried this allready, just wanted to share my experience
Signal	I was hit with a real bad insomnia this passed month. Started about to get bad about 2 weeks ago but these last five nights I haven't been able to get any sleep at all. I fall into these half asleep type things sometimes that are really creepy. I'm kinda starting to worry and I'm feeling I may need to head to the hospital soon.
Signal	I didn't normally get insomnia this bad but ever since quarantine and losing my job it's been a battle. I've completely fucked up my sleep schedule and find it impossible to get back into one.Here's how a typical night goes: I start to feel a bit sleepy at around 11pm and crawl into bed, I end up laying for about 15mins before my mind decides to go for a run. (I call it a run because idk what else to call it but, a run seems like a good descriptive word) What is a run you might ask? Basically I get extremely inspired and think about everything I need to do, everything I can do, fucking diy projects, painting idea's how I can advance quicker in a game I play, how I can produce less waste, how I should organize my bathroom, have I accidentally forgotten someone's birthday and more. Even if I put on a sleep playlist after about 10mins of me calming my mind and focusing on the music my mind starts to get bored and go on another run. This cycle goes on for a few hours before I give in and take a sleeping pill. By then it's already 4am and I sleep all through the next day straight and wake up at around 6pm. I always feel like a failure when I wake up at that time, I feel embarrassed for my boyfriend that I slept all day and didn't clean or do laundry, I have animals to take of that had been in cages all this time. My depression kicks in hard and I forget to take my medication. Then it's 11pm again and the cycle repeats.I need help it's not fair to my boyfriend and its not fair to my animals. I wanna knock myself out by like hitting my head or something that way I can sleep but don't sleep too long. Does anyone have suggestions? I'm desperate.
Signal	The first day I took it, it was amazing I was able to go to sleep at 11pm, but then I still woke up at 3am and couldn't go back to sleep, every since the first day I've been taking it at 10:30 and then trying to take another half when I realize its 4am and I am still not asleep, then I still stay awake, and the only time I can sleep is like 5am. This wouldn't be a problem for me if I didn't have a toddler and soon to be zoom college courses starting at the end of the month, I have alwaaays slept like this, never slept at night and slept through school.... my mom literally describes me as an infant "only sleeping during the day so you can be awake when your dad got home from his night shift" and I don't remember EVER being able to sleep at night time, as a kid they only wanted to give me melatonin which obviously didn't work, I suffer from extreme anxiety and depression because of this crippling anxiety which sometimes I can't sleep because I am scared, and sometimes I can't sleep because I just toss and turn all night even after clearing my head... I was FINALLY prescribed something for my trazodone so I could "try it" before getting serious about my anxiety... but it hasn't helped at all, I might as well be popping flinstone gummies and they would probably make me more tired than this... do I call my psychatrist to change it or up my dose?? I can't wait another 2 weeks to see her again.
Signal	I can't go to bed without it but I can't sleep peacefully either. It's like I'm in a sort of limbo where my body is completely relaxed but my mind is going 100mph. Hands down the weirdest drug I have ever taken.
NotSignal	I know its not a over the counter drug and I doubt doctors actually prescript it and all but has anyone actually tried it for their insomnia? Ps I know there is a huge side effect
Signal	Hi guys! I had to take strong antihistamines 2x a day and oracea (doxy). I stopped the antihistamines after approximately 17 days and before stopping I just took 1x day for 2 days and that was it. After about 2 days my insomnia started. I couldn't sleep at all that night and managed to sleep at 11 am for 3 hours (but of course I was waking up the whole time). I continued taking the doxy for another week and stopping that too. I don't know which medication is to blame (maybe antihistamines?), but 5 weeks after stopping it and my insomnia is still here. Now I get anxiety every time I go to sleep. I try not to think anything and sometimes it works and I fall asleep rather fast, but my sleep is never as good as pre-insomnia. But oh boy when I don't manage to stop the thoughts I can go all night without sleeping. Can you tell me if medication induced anxiety is permanent or temporal?
Signal	Wondering if this is insomnia. I cant sleep til like 4-6a.m. I want to and im hella tired but I just cant sleep. I start thinking and thinking and thinking about life while laying in bed before I sleep. This lasts for hours but feels like minutes. I will often get up after an hour of trying to sleep, eat a snack (or something), try again. But when I do fall asleep, I will sleep for 12hrs at least. I am nocturnal right now. I have been prescribed quetiapine, that hasnt worked. Weed used to help but not anymore. Ive tried soft music, no music, soft light, no light, EVERYTHING. No phone an hour before I try to sleep. Its so frustrating!!!! Why cant I sleep during the nighttttttt.
NotSignal	1. Before you stack up on melatonin pills, try pistachios. There is evidence that just two pistachios contain enough melatonin to boost the hormone above physiological levels.2. Sleep hygiene is more complicated than the simple don't do anything in bed formula we constantly read about, if you do relaxing activities in bed like reading that can actually be helpful to associate bedtime with relax time. 3. Insomnia causes depression and makes your mood abysmal. Therefore, most insomniacs you engage with in this subreddit are trapped in this mindset, so that's why this isn't a very helpful subreddit to gain optimism from, and that’s totally understandable. But just keep that in mind the next time someone slams exercising for not working or that diets have nothing to do with insomnia. 4. Diet does absolutely matter, and diet is much more complicated than trying gluten free or keto or vegan. The raw material for neurotransmitter synthesis in your brain is derived from diet, it most certainly can impact your sleep cycles. The microbes in your gut produce 95% of the serotonin in your body (most of it won't pass the blood brain barrier, luckily your brain doesn't need much). & These microbes thrive when you eat healthy food, especially fiber. Getting your diet on check will require many years of careful rigorous experimenting, researching, not falling to delusional diets and most importantly not giving up. It takes a while for you to learn anything important, health should be your top priority no matter if you think your insomnia is genetic or not, diet will lessen the blows if anything. 5. Getting morning sunlight does actually work for some but not others, give it a try and try to make it consistent. 6. Coffee in the morning can actually up regulate GABA receptors, so it might actually help some sleep in some people (theoretically). 7. Insomnia can be psychosomatic in some people, not necessarily completely but maybe a bit. If you sleep with the expectation that you'll wake up early, that will most likely happen. That's why if you're worried about an exam and sleep you'll wake up an hour before your alarm clock. How do you stop this? It's complicated, but just keep it in mind. Some people sleep way better when the accidentally fall asleep, because there is no expectation. 8. Glycine is a non essential amino acid, some people report to increase sleep quality when supplementing with glycine.
Signal	before anyone comes for my neck here, i’ve had insomnia for years. i always am tired around 7/8 PM sometimes earlier or later depending on when i wake up (which is often very very early then i cant fall back asleep) except, of course, if i am required to wake early for class or work.... i am tired and could snooze all day. im going to college and have big dreams. but if i do not start getting 8 hours a night instead of alternating between 12, 3, or 5, then i will go crazy. i have work like a dog most days and exercise a lot. i also eat a very well balanced diet. i try not to be on my phone in my bed. i try to only relax in my bed such as reading before sleep. yes, i have tried meditating. and i do it often throughout the day. but night time is different.i want to be healthy and energetic. where can i get sleeping pills prescribed to me?
Signal	I go to bed at 10:30 pm and fall asleep at 4-5 am and wake up at 8-9 am. Haven’t slept well in months. My day becomes ruined. I feel tired and unmotivated all day, become unproductive. I’ve got a fucking exam to study about, can’t fucking concentrate. #I just want to sleep.
Signal	I have gone a solid six months without having trouble sleeping. I was able to get off my sleeping medication and get to bed a decent time. I feel like ever since quarantine started my sleep has gotten progressively worse. I’ve tried melatonin but it doesn’t do anything for me. I really don’t want to go back on medication because the medication I was taking gave me violent horrible nightmares and it only made my sleep worse. I just want to sleep but I feel so awake. It’s awful. Anyone else have this problem?
Signal	I have been taking 10mg of melatonin for a very long time now, definitely longer than what doctors and experts would recommend... I'm finding myself having difficulty sleeping, I thought increasing my dosage would help, but to my surprise and extreme frustration, it didn't seem to do anything... I did a little bit of research and the results are all over the place. Some are saying that anything over 5 mg has opposite effect and it it will make you tired, it will also make you restless. my problem is, I've been on 10mg for so long that I feel if I were to drop down to a lower dosage oh, I would have even more of a difficult time sleeping... for the record, I do intend on seeing a doctor to get back on some kind of medication because my insomnia is also powered by my anxiety.I also take Tylenol PM as well, but try not to exceed the recommended dosages
Signal	Every once in a while I wake up around 2, have random anxious thoughts and can't fall asleep until 4 or 5. Sometimes these episodes happen 2 days in a row.I had a somewhat stressful day at work and I could sense that I wasn't going to sleep well tonight. I woke up at 3 feeling wide awake. I might as well get up and start my day. I come to this sub when I'm awake at night. I don't have it nearly as bad as some of you. Thanks for sharing your experience, and hang in there!
Signal	So this was a very long week. I got laid off on monday, since we weren’t allowed to be open. Now I’m currently at home with no clue what to do with all my time. I work on music in my spare time, and I’ve found that even with all this new found time I can’t dedicate myself to finishing my projects. I thought well this is alright I’m sure everything will be fine just need another good nights rest. Then it happened. I had this horrifying episode about 30 minutes after falling asleep It felt like the world shattered around me ten fold and that was what got me to wake up. Once awake I realized that wasn’t reality but I was so scared i didn’t know what to do. That was 3am. Now it’s 8 and I haven’t gotten a wink of sleep. It’s just that moments like these make me wonder what it’s all for. What if I’m just fucked? Seriously what if our lives could be changed so drastically that all my goals suddenly become quite purposeless? It makes you wonder. I also just really hope I can fall asleep cuz this is bullshit
Signal	I haven't slept since yesterday and i feel like shit. Like I'm so fucked up, idk. I feel scared of something and everything is soo creepy and hopeless. I'm fucking scared. I feel a burden on my chest and i tried crying, i tried corvalolum, sedatives, antidepressants, nicotine, shit, everything. I still feel fucking scared and irritated. Im too tired to do something but im too awake to sleep. It probably sounds inconsistent but the way it is
Signal	I finally fell asleep at 3 am. It’s 6 am and I was woken up at 5:30 by a bird that won’t stop chirping outside my window. Now I’m exhausted, wide awake, & I cried because I just so badly want to sleep. I feel so defeated.
NotSignal	Heat wave here (and I know I'm not the only one). My insomnia was bad enough when the indoor temperature was constant. My air conditioner quit on me right in the middle of this heat wave, and, wow. I forgot how spoiled I was.Prior to this, my insomnia has been *just* manageable, with occasional use of benzos (1-2x/week). Now I can't sleep for more than an hour or two between like 6am-9am when the house is at its coolest for the day, and that's if I'm lucky. I've never been particularly fond of the heat, nor of waking up drowning in sweat.Any advice on how to beat the heat (preferably to sleep through it, or at least to survive the trip to my doctor's office to get stronger meds? lol)
Signal	You should drink some sleepytime tea before bed "have you heard of zzz quil?" "Do these deep breathing exercises" Eat. Shit. Yes, Janice. I have tried melatonin. I could shove whole god damn bottle down my throat and still not sleep. I have tried nearly every over the counter medication for sleep and also not for sleep. Tylenol PM, zzz quil, nyquil, benadryl, everything under the sun. If I mention my sleep problems and one more person says the M word or tells me to drink some fucking tea I'm gonna deck someone in the mouth. I ran out of my trazodone like a week ago and I'm still waiting for a refill so I am a very sleep deprived angry night gremlin. I hope I'm not the only one who gets unnecessarily angry when someone tries to prescribe you a whole list of shit to help you sleep.
Signal	since quarantine started my entire sleep schedule has been so fucked up. first i started sleeping at around 5-6am and woke up at 3pm and then i slept at 8am and woke at 4pmlast week i would sleep at 12pm and then wake up at 5pm. now i can’t even sleep. i just lay there with my eyes closed for 3 hours and then give up on sleeping. i bought zzzquil sleep aid pills and took those and nothing happened, still wide awake. i also bought melatonin cough drops (only thing store had) and nothing happened either. i really took sleeping for granted and my favorite thing to do is sleep and now i can’t even do that. i’m not even stressed like i’m probably the calmest i’ve ever been in months ??? help pls
Signal	Has anyone tried Dayvigo? What I was thinking of doing was asking my Dr for 4 doses per month. Most nights I sleep horribly but I thought w/only 4 doses (read 1 per week), I shouldn't have a problem. Any thoughts? I have had insomnia forever (I'm 61 now) and nothing really works long term. Currently taking benzos but I'm noticing they're becoming less and less effective. Had 2 sleep studies and no apnea but I don't get very much deep sleep. For those who use sleep restriction, what do you do to keep busy? I exercise (heavily) but long before bedtime, not much of a TV watcher and if I read I start to fall asleep. Finally, I rarely have trouble falling asleep. Staying and getting deep sleep is the issue. Best of luck to all.
NotSignal	agh. I just want someone to converse with. I don’t wanna wake ppl up but!!! i’m going to lose my mind if I can’t pass the time. also, does anyone else feel animosity from literally anyone they talk to? does that mean i’m just fogged to the point where i’m projecting my own self hatred onto them? or do my erratic topics and lack of detail just drive ppl away that effectively? help plz
Signal	Hello, I've had chronic insomnia for over a year now. It started last June during a case of Pericarditis, when a common cold virus inflamed the sack surrounding my heart. I recovered from that very well, but it left me with the insomnia. I've been told I'm very fit in my annual medical tests, plus I spend a lot of time outside doing a physical job. I used to be the sort of person who could fall asleep so easily, at any time of the day if I wanted, but now I'm living a wide-eyed nightmare. I'm sure many of you know the feeling well. It's making work very difficult, and the doc has suggested Mirtazapine (15mg). I'm scared to use it, since life is difficult enough without a drug dependency later on down the road, and I read that it can cause weight gain. I worked hard to lose weight many years ago, successfully.I've tried a long list of supplements, some of which I shall continue using (like Magnesium), and many I shall abandon (Valerian root does nothing for me any more). I'm sure my loved ones are bored to tears with me and this problem, so I came here to join people who are facing a similar struggle. I am determined to overcome this. The old me who used to fall asleep on the bus or in the blazing sun is still there, he's just being a stubborn git. Many thanks for reading.
Signal	Because it’s 3:30 am, I can’t sleep at all. It’s been like this the whole week. I usually go to bed at 3-4am but when i go to bed i fall asleep super quickly. The other day I was up till 6am and i had to wake up at 8.30. I still don’t know how i survived that day. I just want to sleep
Signal	A little back story- I had about a 2 month period where I struggled to sleep almost every night. Earliest I would fall asleep was about 2am sometimes not at all. Prior to that I had never struggled to sleep.I realized after about 6 weeks that for me it was psychologically based. I have an infant which naturally caused some sleep disturbances which led to stress about not sleeping which became an issue once he started sleeping well. I began researching a bit (a lot here) and realized mindset had a lot to do with my insomnia. Prior I had never once thought about sleep or worried if I didn’t sleep. Now that I’ve realized that I’m trying really hard to remind myself that sleep will happen, and to just enjoy life no matter what . Typically this has been working well for about 8-9 weeks now I’ve slept as normal as anyone with a new baby. However, my so scheduled changed having him up at 230am... for some reason this really messed with my head. I don’t keep a clock in my room (not knowing the time leads to less stress for me) but knowing that my so was getting up at 2 resulted in me not falling asleep until 4-5. Still up at normal time (745) of course by the middle of the night I was back to stressing and worrying about sleep Anyway my question is for people who are working through their insomnia, how do you stop a bad night from spiraling into another episode of insomnia?
NotSignal	I can't sleepLast night, tonight, two nights agoI have other problems too but this is what's inside my brainhttps://i.redd.it/g9iklei37f651.jpg
NotSignal	I never had a time where I go to bed at, I always sleep when I’m very tired. I never thought much of it since I’m a student and I always wake up early which makes me sleepy at night (1-2 am).But now that I’m out of college and unemployed i find it really hard to sleep at night unless i wake up at 7 am max, if i wake up at any later time I’m not sleeping till the next day at 5 am!! I tried to go to bed early (at 12am) today and I couldnt sleep until it was 5 am!!Sorry I just told my life story but I didnt know how to explain it, does this count as insomnia ? It happens to me every summer/ holiday as well but I never thought much of it!
Signal	Just went to the doctor again since Amitriptyline wasn’t doing a thing for me. I was just prescribed 5mg Ambien. I didn’t want to take anything too crazy but I need sleep. Is Ambien safe for insomnia?
Signal	Hello thanks for the ad I’m a new member Greatly appreciate it and thanks.Anyone have experience or knowledge in this will help 🙂 So lately past 5 days or so I had constant insomnia cannot for alseep even though I try. Would lay in bed 9pm to 6 am tossing and turning everyday for past 5 days . Sometimes with sleeping aids like melatonin pills I will have short livid dreams where I can still feel my outside surrounding like my arma and bed. I don’t feel tired at all even though I’m insomnia . Some one please help . Thanks for al your time and I greatly appreciate it.A little background : since the quarantine lockdown I’m lockdown in house all week .
Signal	4 nights ago I got about 2 or 3 hours of sleep, and then I stopped being able to fall asleep at all. I just lay awake all night. I take melatonin and it makes me drowsy for a second or 10, but then I get a full body jerk (I think hypnagogic jerk?) which keeps me awake. After that it just stops working.I honestly don't know what to do, I've been prescribed trazodone and a benzo for sleep but I'm reluctant on taking them because I don't like pills. I also feel completely woke and alert, I'm not sleepy and my body doesn't feel sleepy at all. I'm also not hallucinating or anything like that.Now I'm wondering if exercise would help? Or would this be dangerous for my heart after 4 nights of no sleep? I'm 32.
Signal	I take a lot of nytol one a night. Does anyone know if it has any health effects in the long term? They say it’s not for long term use and I would love to know why considering I take it so often, it’s so crucial for me to fix my sleeping schedule. thx!
NotSignal	I have mild depression and insomnia so laying down when I’m trying to be comfortable playing games/watching YouTube on my bed isn’t helping either of those. I end up laying down for hours and it makes my body want to sleep at the wrong times. Does anyone know how I could sit down comfortably? For example, cozy ways to set up pillows? It would really help because I’m trying to get rid of some of my depression and insomnia since my parents don’t really have time to get pills.Thank you so much for any help! I feel like this might be helpful to other people here.
NotSignal	Huge day at work tomorrow. Would be tough will a clear head and full nights sleep. Have been laying in bed with my eyes shut for hours to no avail. In about four hours my work will start bombarding me with emails. I want to escape. I want to be free of this waking nightmare. I hate this moment and I’m trapped in it. There nothing I can do. I’m going to fail today because I was too afraid of failing to get any rest.
Signal	I was suicidal and went a few years of sleeping horribly until I went through a CBT program. They taught me the right habits, tracked my sleep, and set my sleep window. My sleep is in normal range now. Life saver. Highly recommend it to anyone with sleep issues.

NotSignal	The pain and suffering is too unbearable for me and I just want to end it all 😭
Signal	Hey guys, I'm wondering if anyone had a situation similar to mine? So throughout all my life, I've been a pretty good sleeper. I would fall asleep within 30 mins and would sleep all through the night. I don't remember a time that didn't happen.Suddenly, about a few months ago (I want to say it started in March), I started waking up in the middle of the night after two or three hours of sleep. After waking up, I was unable to sleep at all would just lay in bed all night until my alarm came on, or I would fall asleep lightly for one or two more hours a night. So Initially, I thought it was just due to general anxiety. Maybe I was stressed about work or something similar. Then with corona-virus stuff, my work started having us work from home one week, then the next week in the office, then at home again the week after, alternating every other week. When I did work from home, I noticed if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would fall back again quickly, and even on the weekends, I would sleep straight through the night without even waking up. So, I assumed it was just due to the anxiety of having to wake up early and get ready for work.However, on Friday/Saturday, I woke up in the middle of the night after two hours of sleep and couldn't sleep at all after that. I layed there and eventually heard the birds chirping and night turned into morning. It's horrible.So, I don't really understand why all of a sudden, this started happening when I've had no issues of insomnia ever before.I turned 30 years old in August of last year. I've always had a normal sleep schedule, I exercise 4-5 per week (or did before the gyms closed). I don't really drink often. I don't drink coffee either. I don't believe it has to do with any external factors.I did try using Melotonin. I took a small dose one hour bed, still woke up in the middle of the night, took another 3mg of it, and was able to get a lot of sleep that night. Last night, same thing happened but was this time, wasn't that effective.I'm also thinking of getting some magnesium, trying valerian supplements, and trying some cbd oil.So, I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar situation to mine, or knows what's going on and how to fix it?
NotSignal	Hello everyone!. I wanted to know if any of this has happened to you at some point. Well, sometimes when its late at night and i go to bed, i put my head on my pillow and boom. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeep. And also tension-like headache \[the headache its not strong at all, but its a bit annoying\] This goes away after like 3 minutes, but i find it weird. Any ideas of what this might be?
NotSignal	I have been a poor sleeping for many years. I have been diagnosed with light Obstructive Sleep Apnea and have tried a CPAP but not for long enough to get used to it. I have blocks of days where my brain doesn't shut off and I can't get to sleep.I was pretty psyched when sleep tracking was added to wearables, thinking this would help me track my progress and improve my sleep. And perhaps for some people, it does, if they keep a journal, say, of the many different variables that can contribute to poor sleep, and then keep track of eliminating them or changing those variables. I never did that, except for when I went to sleep: The sleep tracker on my wearable has indicated that I get the most 'deep sleep' when I go to bed early, say before 11pm.Recently I was also sleeping with a pulse oximeter to help me monitor whether or not I had covid-19. I noticed that when I did wake up during the night, which as you probably know is totally normal, I'd glance at the oximeter to check the reading. Checking the reading, in turn, would cause me to become more awake as I thought about what it was reading, even if it was normal.At some point in the two weeks I ditched the oximeter because I realized that after I'd wake up, reading it was keeping me awake. This worked for me, I started to feel like I was getting better sleep during the night.Bulding on that, I decided to stop wearing my fitbit to bed. This also worked for me: between the glowing green lights on the underside of the thing, which I can see at night, and checking the thing when I woke up in the middle of the night, I now believe these devices may be preventing many people from quickly returning to sleep after they wake up.So now I don't wear anything when I go to bed and I believe my sleep is the better for it. FYI, just something to think about. Perhaps, sometimes, less is more.
NotSignal	Hi fellow insomniacs!So I have a lot of trouble ever getting to sleep, but just as big of a problem for me is staying asleep. I've noticed one of the main reasons I wake up so often is that my brain is busy trying to "solve" something. Its usually complete nonsense from the dream world and obviously isn't solvable. Something similar is that I can't listen to music to go to sleep because my brain will repeat the lyrics over and over again until it frustrates me into waking up.Does anyone else experience anything like this or have tips on how to manage it? Its exhaustingThanks x
NotSignal	I've reached a breaking point but I don't want to spend thousands of dollars in the hospital if they won't treat me but I can't do this for another night
Signal	So i will often go a couple days without sleeping and be pissed at everything. But whenever im with my gf she can make me fall asleep in literally 5 minutes. Its the strangest thing. She'll lay me down in her lap and brush my eyebrow with a finger and boom im out. What really fucking sucks is when i actually go to bed. Because due to parents boundaries we cant sleep together. So ive gotta wait until me and her are married. And in the meantime. Im lucky to fall asleep at 3. Tonight is not one of those nights. Its 2:30 and im a live wire despite downing 6mg of melatonin. I dont wanna have to do what i did awhile back and just throw back a handful. So im just gonna rough it and look foward to lappy nappies tomorrow...
NotSignal	I sleep for 9 hours or more every night and i exercise 1 hour Daily and yet i am still tired all day. Some weekends i sleep from fridag night to sunday morning only getting up twice to go to the bathroom and drink. However my mom refuses to let see a doctor because she doesn’t believe them. Does anyone know what is wrong with me?
Signal	I have tried unisom, chamomile, cbd, laying in bed for a long time hoping to just fall asleep. I'm at the point where my body aches from the sleep deprivation and I'm very anxious.
Signal	Mirtazapine causes sleepiness by blocking histamine receptors, but it also increases norepinephrine (specially in high dosages) which promotes wakefulness. Trazodone blocks norepinephrine. So if I combine Mirtazapine and Trazodone, they should potentiate each other, right?Has anyone tried this combination?
Signal	it's currently 5:48 am at the time of writing this. i'm exhausted in all ways, i just want to sleep. insomnia has been nothing but a pain to me, and for a while it was gone! it had stopped showing up while i was on a consistent school schedule. that's gone, and my sense of time with it. my body won't let me rest. it physically hurts to be awake right now. melatonin doesn't work. i try to trigger my POTS and that doesnt let me sleep, i just get dizzy lol. i'm so over this. any tips?
Signal	so its been 6 months now since my chronic insomnia suddenly started.before i always had no problem sleeping but on december last year i started waking up after 5 hours into my sleep and id get heartburn along with a panic attack. so my doctor prescribed me with ambien which worked for me for about two weeks and after that it stopped working after that he told me to stop taking ambien and prescribed me seroquel 25mg which worked for only about a month before it stopped working and im back to the usual 5 hour sleepafter that i noticed my sleep getting worse and shorter now i can only sleep 3 hours a night and when i try to go back to sleep after i wake up i just jolt awake after an hour and i just feel tired and terrible the whole day ive tried everything , sleep hygiene , sleeping aids all the worksthe only underlying cause for my insomnia right now that i can point at is undiagnosed sleep apnea or the dreaded fatal insomnia i recently started getting a constant lightheaded feeling like my head is underwater and my limbs are floating which got me really worried but for now im just treating it with antibiotics and hopefully its just another one of my usual ear infections that i get multiple times a yearsleep study is delayed indefinitely due to the pandemic.i hope i make it until the end of pandemic.
Signal	Hey,Just trying to get another perspective on this as I lay here with 4h until I have to be awake for work. I work in a minimum wage job for some perspective, so we have plenty of staff + replacements if I do call in. Once a year for the past few I get a nasty bout of insomnia, right now is this year's time. A lot of stress piling up recently amongst other things is the leading cause at the moment. I've called into work twice this week already, once stating personal reasons (just a cover for insomnia) and the other stating insomnia itself. My work has a pretty open policy with sick calls, you call in, and you dont need a reason. People getting penalized or fired for sick calls do not happen unless it becomes a regular thing, which for me, besides the last few days hasnt been the case. I gave reasons anyway, even just to soothe my guilt about calling in. After my shift today I have a day off & then 5 days in a row following that and I'm really worried that not being able to get this over with in the next 2 days will just lead to it extending further. So can I get an opinion on whether other people think its ok to call in one more time and try to get a handle of this before my 5 in a row? Or should I just suck it up, get what I can and survive...
NotSignal	I used to be like I can’t sleep lets just play games all night, Now I’m feel like fuck another night of me attempting to sleep..
Signal	After a month and a half of having trouble sleeping, I'm starting to get my sleep back. At least I think I did. I noticed that during the day time, I'm starting to get more anxious and depressed over every little thing. I wake up feeling fine, mostly because my mind is still sorta shut off to think of anything. After a while tho, my wind wanders off and start to cloud with thoughts like "you didn't get enough sleep, you won't make it through today." It makes me aware of my consciousness and throughout the day, every time this happens I get lightheaded and lose focus a lot. I feel like it's getting worse and worse. I'm currently in college and work on campus. Any tips?
NotSignal	My gf wakes up a lot of times every night. She doesn't usually have any problem with getting to sleep at night, but then she will wake up for no f\*cking reason, like 4 or 5 times. Most times, she goes back to sleep in minutes. Sometimes she can't go back to sleep so fast, and she rolls around in bed. Best case scenario, she wakes up 2 times, goes immediately to sleep. Worst case scenario, she wakes up 6 times, spends 20 minutes rolling in bed, asking for cuddles and absolutely destroying my sleep.She's been like this for years, but she slept normally when she was a kid. She's vegetarian too, since she was a teenager, I don't know if something in her diet could be causing it.I don't know if this is normal either, but it sure as hell is killing me. Does anyone have experience with this problem?
NotSignal	Hi, I'm 13. I've had a week of 7 hours a night, but tonight I just couldn't relax. Even now, I have a strong urge to get up and do things. There's no pressure to get up today so if I slept now I could sleep until 11am/12pm. However, this might mess up my schedule. Should I take it or leave it and get a really good sleep tonight?
Signal	I didnt nap all day because i wanted to sleep regularley. Thought it was working around 8 and 9 when i was falling asleep sitting up. Now its fucking two in the god damn morning and i SO FUCKING AWAKE. FUCKING KILL ME. My heart rate is fast and im anxious. What the fuck is wrong with me.
Signal	Been suffering from insomnia for 2 months. Prescribed Trazodone. Been doing a little too much research lately on the side effects. Is it worth taking to help with anxiety and sleep???
Signal	This is just horrible, my sleep cycle is fucked, I can't sleep in night because of amxiety and I always sleep at day then I wake up in afternoon, my day is just wasted I hate this shit. I know there are some of you have experiencing worse than this but still I hate it.
NotSignal	So when I say no sleep it's not an over exaggeration, I mean NO SLEEP 0 nothing wide awake the whole time. I'm going to push through today and try to be positive but this has to be the last time this happens. I'm going to stay up till night time to reset my sleep schedule are there any tips I can take to maintain my sleep schedule overtime in the past I've found that all nighter do work but my sleep schedule just starts to go from 9pm to 3am slowly how can I prevent this from happening again also give me some words of encouragement because this is gonna suck
Signal	I was prescribed Clonazepam 0.5 MG. I’ve been taking those for 10 days by now and still can’t sleep. I was thinking of taking more than my prescribed dosage. My psychiatrist said to continue 0.5 MG for a month but I really feel like popping 3-4 of those. I don’t know what to do.
NotSignal	I'm 16 and my dad is very strict. I don't have insomnia, but I have trouble sleeping. It not that bad but on school nights it's worse because I have to be in bed between 9:30 and 10:30 when I'm nowhere near tired. For the last couple of months, he's been obsessed with pointing out that my eyes are really sunken in and he thinks that's because I'm tired which I'm not it's just the shape of my eyes and they've always been like that and he has the same exact same eyes.I like to fall asleep to either a podcast or a youtube video and last night I fell asleep to a video. It was on my bedside table and I was facing the other way so I clearly wasn't watching it and it was on the lowest volume, just so I had some quiet familiar voices to focus on while I fell asleep. I've been doing this for years, but last night I accidentally clicked on a playlist instead of a video and my phone didn't turn itself off like it usually would if I had just watched a single video. My dad got up at literally 4:30 for god knows what reason and saw my phone on and got really mad at me. Like he got mad at me at 4:30 in the morning and I couldn't fall back asleep because I was stressed. Now he thinks he was because of that that my eyes are sunken in (I HAVE HOODED EYES THEY AREN'T EVEN SUNKEN IN AND HE HAS THE SAME EYE SHAPE I GOT IT FROM HIM) and he said he's gonna check every night that my phone is on its charger and if it's not I'm not allowed to have it in my room. He also said if he catches me again he will completely disconnect me from the internet as soon as school finishes.I don't know what to do now I don't know how I'm going to sleep. I obviously wasn't awake at 4:30 because I'm completely rested today and he knows how I look and act when I get that little sleep. And again I wasn't even facing the way of the phone if I was watching youtube why would I be facing the other way. AND I WAS CLEARLY ASLEEP he woke me up and he thinks I was just fake sleeping. I have an iPad I guess I could shove that under my pillow or something but I've done it before and it's too loud even on lowest volume and I'm paranoid he's going to check. I know I can't rely on podcasts to put me to sleep forever but I really am not ready. Especially at the time that he makes me go to bed, I feel like I'm wasting 2 hours lying there doing nothing until I get tired. I really can't explain it to him because I can't even explain it to myself I just have too many thoughts and I need a distraction to fall asleep. If there's something to stress about I'll think about that all night and if there's nothing to stress about I think about something I'm excited about and that keeps me up too. I'm panic typing this. Maybe I'm overreacting and I'll probably delete it soon but I've been stressing all day and honestly, I want to cry. If I was allowed to go to bed when I felt tired it wouldn't be as big of an issue, but 9:30 is so early it's the same time he's been making me go to bed since I was 8 and I'm just not tired. &#x200B;TLDR: Podcasts have been helping me sleep for years and I can't use them anymore and I don't know what to do
Signal	I was prescribed baclofen during a benzo detox almost exactly a year ago. I stopped taking it around 9 months ago. As of now I am quitting kratom, nicotine, and my antidepressant and I’m quickly realizing this was too much all at once. I haven’t had that many symptoms except for insomnia, but the insomnia is bad. I haven’t slept right in like 4 days and I’m starting to feel really shitty. I remembered I had baclofen a few days ago and took a 20 mg pill. All it did was make me feel stimulated. However it works great for RLS so it’s like one step forward one step back. Would a higher dose help with sleep? Do I have a permanent tolerance and low doses are making me hyper? And what would help me with sleep? I really don’t want to go back to antidepressants, and I’m very wary of benzos even short term as I was dependent on them before and that was hell. But if nothing else helps me sleep I might have to do Ativan for a week or something.
NotSignal	If I don’t go to sleep by midnight , I won’t sleep. I can’t be up watching a movie, be driving or working on something in the garage . If I don’t take a shower and lay down before midnight I won’t go to sleep
NotSignal	Ive done research on meditation, zzquil, melatonin, barbiturates, benzos, sedatives & hypnotic. What should I do to be prescribed a sleep inducing pills? I've done meditation, weed, last thing was self medication with alcohol and pills yet I still woke up @2am supper sluggish. I'm no addict I just want some damn uninterrupted sleep. My 2 doctors are against benzos and I don't want to be referred to a psychiatrist. Help me.
NotSignal	It's 6AM, I have to go to school and I've only had an hour of rest so far, this is my last resort.Ok so, I don't know if I actually have insomnia, but I know my dad will wake up multiple times per night and go sit outside on the porch. I've had similar symptoms occasionally but I usually have no problem getting sleep.But every once in a while I have night that are just a fucking nightmare.I go to bed like normal, about an hour later I start to wake up, and my brain seems like it's racing at 100mph, constantly evaluating things and the most random images, names, faces, places just start rapid fire popping up in my imagination, and the fucking scary thing is I have no idea who these people or experiences are...It feels like someone else is in my body please help I'm so fucking tired and I know it's gonna be a shit day now....
Signal	I'm well aware the body needs sleep but sometimes after a few sleepless nights I start to fear I'll just get more and more sleep deprived without ever falling asleep. I had one sleepless night, like, max 30 minutes of sleep, and after one of those nights I usually pass out rather easily the night after. But instead, I just had another sleepless night, probably got around and hour or so. I feel nauseous, I have a bad headache and my brain and body feels messed up. I can handle only getting a few hours of sleep or taking a long time to fall asleep, but another night of not sleeping and I'll go insane. I hear people say to just become really tired, to just go about your day or to stay up to fix your sleep schedule, but it seems no matter how sleep deprived l am I still stay awake. Whatever is keeping me awake overrides my sleep deprivation and for some irrational reason I'm scared I'll just never sleep. Anyways goodmorning :))
NotSignal	Was wondering if I could chat with someone I feel like I’m going crazy and I have googled things and now think the worst
NotSignal	My brothers usually sleep early but they've been up late with me as well. It's now 50 days since I've slept before 7 am. Mainly playing call of duty and listening to old school Grand theft auto radio stations. A doctor came today and wouldn't listen to me that I have withdrawals, oh well.50 consecutive days of no rest before 7 am. I came off of anti psychotic pills cold turkey so I think that's the reason, I didn't taper at all.
Signal	I have bipolar and I’m at a friends house rn and forget my meds but I took lots of melitolon and was tired big she’s listening to a loud ass gaming YouTube video and I can’t sleep it’s just making me awake and every time I turn it off she wakes up and turns it back on
NotSignal	Hi folks! So, when I was much younger I did struggle with insomnia pretty regularly. I managed to overcome it eventually, with the help of medication and some therapy. I no longer take medication as I haven’t needed it in a while and was never a huge fan of the side effects. But lately I’ve been experiencing insomnia quite frequently. Like tonight; it is 6:30AM, and I have have been laying in bed since about 12. I usually fall asleep around 2-3, which I know is considered pretty late for most but I’ve always been a night owl and late riser. But lately, I’ve found myself laying awake for hours, feeling very tired, but not quite... sleepy? It almost feels like the action of sleeping is being cooked up in my mind, but not being sent to the rest of my body, if thy makes sense. I want to go to sleep, desperately, but no amount of perfectly dosed/timed melatonin, NyQuil, meditation, distraction, or sleeping tea (which otherwise usually will just knock me tf out lol). I lay awake for hours, usually battling anxiety attacks and constantly having to talk myself down from the attacks. I know it is very normal to be kept up by your thoughts, but it just seems so spontaneous, as I am usually fine before going to bed and as I am laying down. Butt then as hours pass, I just involuntarily start going into paranoia and panic and rehashing past traumas etc. Maybe this isn’t the right place, but I figured if anyone knows of practices to help calm oneself and get closer to a sleep state, the folks in this sub would be it. Hope this isn’t annoying! I find that meditation and pleasant visualizations (like imagining myself in a pink cloud or in a warm lagoon, pleasant and safe imaginary places etc) really help me. But clearly they do not help enough. Any help is greatly appreciated. Again, thanks so much in advance to any help or support!
NotSignal	I have found it difficult to fall asleep during normal hours (i.e. 23:00 - 00:00) almost all my life. I usually go to bed around that time and fell asleep around 03:00 - 04:00. Now this wouldn't be such a problem during weekends, but on workday is a total nightmare as I have to get up around 07:30. Please let me know what do you think causes insomnia and what methods for fighting it do you recommend?
NotSignal	Tic. Tic. Tic. That clock, that damned clock. Tic. One Second. Tic. Two Seconds. Tic. Three Seconds. Repeatedly 1. 2. 3. Almost asleep but it won’t stop ticking, just a little longer and it will grow quiet. No. No it won’t stop. I have to get up and shut the damned thing off. It’s Off. Now I can finally fall asleep. Tic. One. Tic. Two. Tic. Three. No. No. No! It’s not possible! It’s Off! That Sound! The constant 1. 2. 3. The melody, it won’t leave! Tic. Tic. Tic. No, this isn’t right. Tic. Tic. Tic. Wait. Thump. Thump. Thump. It’s my damned heart, no matter what I do, the ticking won’t stop. 900 Seconds. 300 sets of 1. 2. 3. Before that melody plays again. There is no escape. The damned ticking, and that damned melody. Forever playing during the night, unable to stop it. By the morning it will be gone, forgotten again. 8 hours. The melody plays every 15 minutes. I am only 2 hours in. That melody will play 24 more times in this nightmare. The nightmare conceived by the ticking. Just to be forgotten, along with the melody. In 6 more hours. 24 times that melody will be heard before this nightmare ends. And the day’s long torment of fatigue will begin. Only to hear that damned melody again that night, never getting any sleep. The clock gets turned off every night. But. Keeps. On Ticking.
Signal	So I’ve had insomnia for years now and from time to time like this morning Ill wake up for no reason and be pumped up full of adrenaline and my body is like your not getting to fucking sleep any more buddy you got 3 hours of sleep last night and its time to work out... why the fuck is my brain like this. Like cant i at least be tired enough to fall back asleep and get a normal nights rest? Like i know i stayed up till 4 am doing the graveyard shift for work but why am i wide awake for no fricken reason... i apologize for the long ass rant but im just confused why my brain decides to do this on occasion.
NotSignal	God damn it, it’s been like the 5th week in a row this happened.I work the night shift, I’m supposed to *sleep* at 9am. This winter has been harsh, and every time I wake up I’m like “I bet it’s fucking 9am” and yep it is. Sleep during the work week is normal, I sleep like a baby. But the weekends, I just get fucked up then.Any tips?
Signal	As I’m writing this, I’m in bed after another night of absolutely no sleep. For the past two weeks, my ability to sleep has whittled down to nothing, going from at most four hours, to around one or two, to now absolutely nothing. I’ve suffered from insomnia all my life, with bouts of severe lack of sleep before, but never to this level. My balance has become pretty awful, I can walk, but not for long. My arms, most specifically my wrists, are weak and go numb / experience weakness more than they should. Physical and mental fatigue have worsened every day, I’ve tried pushing through it but my body nearly shuts down functionality wise so I have to return to bed. My concentration is very poor, my eyesight is blurry when trying to see from a far or focus on anything. I have muscle spasms in my neck, legs, and arms every so often. I no longer have an appetite, I eat to survive, and i also urinate much more than I ever have before. I have trouble speaking, also i lose my train of thought or cannot keep up when someone is talking to me. At this point I’m essentially bed bound from physical fatigue. I don’t ever nod off, nor do I experience microsleep at this point. I’ve had multiple blood and urine tests, all coming back normal. I had a ct scan for back pain I had been experiencing, but no cause was found. I also had an ultrasound done due to my urinary problems as well as groin pain, still nothing. For sleep, I had relied on Klonopin .5 for the past 3 years to help get the job done, i still am taking it at the same dosage, but it seems not to be helping. I’ve also been given Amitriptyline, but i haven’t seen any effects. I’ve tried many and all over the counter medications as well as prescribed, such as melatonin (up to 10mg), trazedone, benadryl, ambien, all with my other medications to no use. I do have a history of anxiety and sleep disorder, but with how severely this has affected me physically, mentally, and neurologically, i could not imagine that’s all that’s going on. It is difficult to even type this out, my hands weaken quickly and have pins + needles if my arms are raised to long. I’ve also tried sleeping in a healthier position, going to bed earlier to give myself as much time as possible to sleep, sworn off caffeine, and avoided screen time before attempting to sleep. I’m sure this is thrown around more than enough and may turn people away, but I worry this could somehow be SFI. Truly, no matter what I do, I cannot sleep nor feel I have the ability to. My quality of life has all but vanished, I’m not myself anymore. I’m literally physically wasting away with muscle atrophy, nerve issues, and neurological impairment from this. I do not know what answers could save me from this, I just wanted to put this out there to see if anyone else has fallen this far due to sleep deprivation.
Signal	hi everyone - recently i’ve been taking 12 mg of melatonin and a benadryl to sleep at night and it’s the only thing that works for me anymore. i told my parents about it and they mentioned how this habit could lead me to drug use in the future and how harmful it is to my body... i asked my therapist if this was the case and she disagreed with them. does anyone have any knowledge of benadryl and melatonin together and if it’s bad or not? thanks!!
Signal	Idk if i’ll ever be able to sleep because i have to get up at 6am and it’s currently 4:15am. I remember a dream but it mustve been seconds. I mean, I took half of a zopiclone tonight at 11:30 pm in hope that it would help me to get some sleep since I have to get up at 6 for work but i guess it didn’t worked OR it knocked me out for a few hours because Idk last time i looked at the time it was 3:45 am but strangely i don’t feel like i actually slept. I might have just stared at the ceilling being deep in my thoughts. For now, i am just browsing reddit while listening to music on my phone. Ugh i hate this. I hope today i’ll be able to get more sleep pressure for the (next) night.
NotSignal	so for about 3 weeks now, i went from having still an acceptable amount of sleep, just that i wake up 5 times in a night, to sleeping once in 2 nights... on some days i don’t even feel tired in the next day after not sleeping the previous night, some days i feel tired in the day but i resist napping in hopes of being able to sleep but no, i somehow get more energetic at night despite yawning non stop. it’s been 3 weeks and i don’t wanna accept this to be part of my remaining life i want this fucking shit gone. im starting to get weird aches/sensations in my legs and i feel my whole body pulsating particularly in my calves and feet, my knees hurt and my muscles all over my body twitch for no reason. i’m 18 and i have the most important exam in my life at the end of this year.
NotSignal	I literally get so worn down that I start seeing bugs crawling on me or shadow people out of the corner of my eye. It’s not really scary because I know it’s not real, but it can be quite disturbing. It usually only happens when I don’t sleep well for a few days. I have constant nightmares, so I don’t know if I’m even getting the proper sleep when I DO finally pass out. I’m just exhausted.
Signal	I used to be able to sleep without even trying. The stress and pressure I've experienced lately has given me insomnia, I can't fall asleep and when I do it's only for a short while, I'm always tired and I wake up with back aches. Any suggestions on how to cope asides sleeping pills?
Signal	Hi guys, I've been always insomniac since I was a kid. Have had nights trying to sleep for hours till the sun shines. Sometimes I think I sleep out of exhaustion.. I'm 39 right now and sadly, as I need to work, I have to sleep.The problem is.. I can't relax. I can't just stop thinking. Even taking clonazepam (only worked for some days), zolpidem and eszopiclone (same problem). When I drink a coke at Lunch, things got way worse. Have to take twice of everything. I've tried natural meds and supplements also. Melatonin makes me sleepy but it does not relax me. My bed seems uncomfortable..SSRIS makes me so tired that sometimes I can sleep earlier.. But doesn't seem a good solution because I won't produce and libido is zero while on them.Histaminergic agents, including antidepressants, work only in the beginning also, and makes me fatter. I don't do sports, zero..Any thoughts? The exercising thing everybody will tell but I was kinda gym freak for sometime and nothing had changed..
Signal	Hello everyone.I've recently been having difficulty sleeping after previously having no issues with sleep in the past. I'm currently stuck in a state where I'm not feeling physically tired/drowsy and it's leading me to often stay awake the whole night.My doctor advised me to consider using an antihistamine medication to ensure drowsiness. Would it be advisable to use the antihistamine to get my sleep routine back in track?
NotSignal	Hi all, so let me start off by saying I don't suffer from what most would term as chronic or serious insomnia. Throughout certain periods in the year I would find myself having trouble falling asleep for a while upon retreating to the bed at night, but that was pretty much there was to it. Most of the time it was the case of a particularly troubled/ecstatic mind, or I had coffee too close to bedtime. However there were times I couldn't come up with an explanation for the cause, where I couldn't sleep at my usual bedtimes. I would be talking about my background information in the upcoming paragraph (for better understanding), so feeI free to skip to the next for the main gist. So I had rather inconsistent sleep cycles, especially so in the past month due to increased workload, tight deadlines and poor time management in college. A month before college started (July)I was sleeping at 4-12. Just the fortnight before I was sleeping 2-11. Last week was 3-11 but gradually became 5-1. Add to the fact that I had morning classes as early as 9 and I was waking up on days where I had to use an alarm, and had to compensate for the lack of sleep by taking afternoon naps. (if I could even find the time to do so)Tldr; very irregular sleep cycles and patterns throughout the past 2 months or soSo I really think I had really knackered my sleep cycle because of that. I did not sleep on sunday night and spent the next few days sleeping way earlier than my usual bedtimes to compensate for the sleep debt. And so I thought I was on track to having a better sleep cycle by being able to sleep early. But just last night I went to bed at 12 and laid awake for 7 hours until 7am! I was clearly tired as I tried to get up halfway through to get some work done, but my attention gave way after just a few minutes. (Droopy eyes, etc) But back to the bed, eyes shut for a few seconds and I'm back to being awake again.I had a meal at 8pm prior that I would normally take for breakfast, (tea, eggs, sausages and bread) so could it be a case of confusion for the body? The day before I slept 11-9am, had lunch at 2pm and took a nap from 3-5pm Are there any other explanations that can account for this? Thanks guys so much for the time and input.
NotSignal	Having really bad insomnia lately with all the Coronavirus news. Plus it doesn’t help to be isolated/alone and anxious. Does anyone have any tips on how to cope with the sinking feeling that creeps in during the small hours?
NotSignal	These days have been really hard to sleep, I take a bath 2-3x daily and my body still find it so hot/warm. Well, I have no ac and living in a tropical country so yeah, I guess I’ll have to live with it. I have 2 fans and have stuffy nose. I miss sleeping at night. Summer, please end already. 😵
Signal	When I lay down to go to sleep my mind is awake. My mind creates vivid dreaming/imagery and music playing. This only happens when I attempt to sleep, any other time like sitting on the couch, watching TV, etc. I'm exhausted. As I'm writing this I feel like I'm going to collapse from lack of sleep. I don't understand what is going on and why I can't sleep. Please help.
NotSignal	A week ago I had one rough night sleeping, the entire night I was aware that I was thinking. Often about programming. I even tried to solve my sleep problems with programming terms. Time went by fast though but it felt like it took forever. Now I've been having trouble sleeping every night, and I find myself often slipping into this like thinking sleep and I continue to try to solve my sleep with stupid thoughts, but ihave to snap myself awake then force my mind to stop to get into rem sleep. I'm terrified that I have sfi or ffi so much so that I'm considering suicide. The worst part is a few years ago I'd had a dream that I was going to die at this age.
NotSignal	Does anyone’s insomnia get worse when they have many difficult and stressful things coming up in their life? For example a bunch of differently things building up and you just have this uneasiness and are unable to relax and get really anxious and then just can’t fall asleep?
NotSignal	I don't believe I took any of the trazodone I was a suicidal attempt. I believe I'm absolutely shitfaced. Crying and just upset about life to the point of ripping out my hair. I tried going to sleep and almost psycadellics when I close my eyes. Like a floating sensation. Am I overthinking do you think I could be drunk. I'm very jittery and quick moving when I lay down I don't have trouble with the moving but when I close my eyes it's almost like I'm floating.. there is a tight sensation on the left side of my head that's radiating to the back and down my neck..I'm scared. I don't know if I should sleep tonight or what. I missed both of my antidepressants today buperon and Venlafaxine
Signal	I have a midterm coming up but been dealing with a bad bout of insomnia, how do you manage do do well on tests like this?
NotSignal	I’m currently reading Guy Meadows’ The Sleep Book. There’s a lot of stuff in there that really resonates with me. Letting go and getting back to just sleeping rather than struggling to find methods to force me to sleep sounds exactly like what I need to be doing. My question is- do you have to spend a week between chapters, or can you go ahead and read the book like a regular book In that you keep reading until you’re done? I’m only at week 1, and while there was some good stuff in there, the real meat of the book and strategies seem to come later and I want to proceed to them. Any advice from successful people would be greatly appreciated.
NotSignal	Recently, my sleeping cycle is all over the place. The isolation thing plus working from home and the tendency i have to feel better about me and my life in the late night hours/dawn has messed me up to the point that currently I simply can't sleep in my bed if isn't in the afternoon. Just now, i was at the sofa with my boyfriend and kinda fell at sleep while he'd play FF7. So he woke me up for us to properly sleep in bed and, well, he did. I didn't.I was just sleeping in the couch. Why on fucking hell i can't continue sleeping right now??? And the worst part is: I'm 90% sure that, if I'd just return to the sofa, I'd de able to fall sleep again. And I know that cuz I've sleeping in the couch for the past 3 days or so. Plus, I don't have any problem in sleeping in my bed during the daytime. I've sleeping for an 1 hour or so during my lunch hour almost daily cuz my nights are all messed up. I just really don't know what to do.
Signal	Does anyone else experience these just as they fall asleep? I often only get a few hours a night, and I do mean just a few. It seems when I finally do get exhausted enough to lay my head down right away, I begin to hear various noises that sound like they are within the room. This has ranged from people talking(sounds more like a radio) to thumping, whistling to paper crunching. Just wondering if anyone else has had the bizarre experience once they finally lay down. Also, I do not experience this throughout the day. This is only after laying down when I did not get much sleep the night before.
NotSignal	I get burned out and lose concentration fast. I'm trying to write up something and i just burn out from the emotions of it; I'm exhausted.
Signal	My insomnia started about three months ago, not long after my country got put into lockdown and it's only gotten worse as time has gone on.Initially I didn't consider it to be insomnia, I just had the odd night when I would wake up a lot and only get about 4 hours instead of my usual 8. Now I usually only get 1 or 2 hours and maybe once or twice a week I'll be lucky and get 4. I've switched to decaf, have ear plugs to cancel out noise, an eye mask, I've started meditating, I have self-therapy writing sessions to release all my anxiety and stress from the day, I do an intense work out nearly every day for 30-40 mins, I'm not drinking alcohol, I eat 3-4 hours before bed and I spend at least an hour winding down reading before trying to sleep. And none of it is helping. At all. I've done some reading and found that in CBT-I, a common technique used to sort insomnia is sleep restriction. I want to try it, forcing myself to stay awake until I'm falling asleep on my feet and then waking myself up at 8am like usual, it sounds like it might work after several days. I was wondering if anyone here has tried it and has any advice on how best to go about it or if there's anything I should avoid? Also if anyone is curious I'll comment about how it goes over the next few days.
Signal	Hi! I'm not too familiar with posting on message boards or any other kind of online media platform. I will be up-front; I'll admit I have not yet read much on this sub, but was inclined to post as I I needed a place to vent. I have incredible friends, who are very understanding, but I'm tired (hah) of continuously bothering them with this issue. So here goes.I'm completely sleep deprived. These past few weeks I have been in a continuous cycle of daytime exhaustion, yet I am unable to even close my eyes the moment I slam myself onto my mattress. I've tried pushing myself into sleep by staying awake, trying homeopathic medicine, exercise, to no positive effect. I'm drinking a lot. A lot. I can't function properly during daytime, and I'm letting the folks around me I care much about as well as myself, completely down. This has caused me to lose my job a couple of weeks back.TL;DRI'm a disaster. I'm not sure what to do. I'm not even sure of what I'm doing at this time, but I want to be better. If anyone of you have tips and tricks, much appreciated. If not; thank you for listening. I feel better already just venting.(Sorry for the poor English, I'm not a native speaker and I've had quite a bit to drink)
Signal	Ever since my mom died about 3 weeks ago the most sleep I've gotten in one night is maybe like 6 hours. Most nights I've gotten 4, some nights I've gotten zero. Even if it's a night I somehow manage to fall asleep early, I inevitably wake up a few hours later and can't go back to sleep. I really don't know why. Contacted my primary care doc recently but there weren't any appointments for over two fucking weeks, and I'm also going back to college in like 6 days. I just feel awful and have barely been able to get anything done since I'm so consistently exhausted.I've tried melatonin, CBD, benadryl and unisom. At best they make it a tiny bit easier to fall asleep. I also have completely cut coffee/caffeine thinking that might be my issue, but going on a week and a half without it hasn't helped at all. I also had fairly mild insomnia 3-4 years back, I did get something prescribed (I don't remember what) for a couple months back then which def helped. Can urgent care clinics do anything to help? Id rather not go there and waste my time and money if they just say they can't do anything. I called one over an hour ago explaining everything and they said they'd call me right back but I'm still waiting.
NotSignal	Today I felt sleepy earlier than usual (10pm) so put on my head phones put my favorite sleeping sounds and tried to sleep at 2hrs got tired of tossing and turning and here I am my favorite reddit group when I cant sleep. 😁
NotSignal	My insomnia began during quarantine and I think it had something to do with my life changing from very hectic (getting good sleep always 8 hours) to staying home and only leaving for 1-2 hours a day to exercise. The insomnia has gradually worsened from sleeping for 1-2 hours then waking up for 1 hour then sleeping for 4hrs. To now I wake up right before i fall into real sleep (every 30 mins) until 3-4 am and I’ll sleep until 8 (maybe wake up once). After reading a lot on this subreddit I think I know my Insomnia is caused by my anxiety about sleep and trying too hard to sleep. I saw someone suggest CBT-I and ACT strategies which I am definitely interested in, but online programs are hundreds of $$$. Does anyone have book suggestions I think I will buy the sleep book for ACT but does anyone know good CBT-I books?
NotSignal	Not the first time this happened, I think I posted about here last time. Idk. My mind sure is messy right now, though.I'm not only an insomniac, but also a hypochondriac. That being said, I wonder if not feeling sleepy at all after staying awake for a full day is normal? My eyes are sore and my head hurts, but I'm kind of hyper right now. Dunno. Help? Is this common?
NotSignal	I'm considering doing either next week,but I don't want to dive into something that'll only make my sleep worst.
Signal	Psychiatrist prescribed me insomnia medication last year and go be honest, it was going pretty well. I was getting much better sleeps. Anyway, my work and college is closed due to the virus scare, and with that freedom, oh boy have I been irresponsible. Nothing like partying, just simply sleeping till midday, staying up til 4am doing various things. I was cleaning my pantry yesterday at 1am. It's been a week of this and I'm barely a functioning human during the day. I live with my partner who still has work so he doesn't know my shameless sleep-ins. He also sleeps before me so he doesn't know I'm staying up so late. I was caught cleaning the living room at an ungodly hour a few nights ago. I'm so worried I'm stuck in this cycle. I even take my sleeping pill at midnight and it usually SHOULD kick in after an hour but sometimes I still am wide awake.
Signal	but I can't fucking fall asleep. Decided to go to bed earlier beacuse school starts tomorrow and took a hot bath before and tried some meditation but that made me feel sick. I know this might be just that one night but it's horrible. I feel bad for you all with actual insomnia and can't imagine living with it. I hope sleep comes to all of us.
Signal	Surprise surprise I can’t sleep. Even if I do sleep, it’s at 5am and I’m constantly tossing and turning unable to get comfy or stay asleep for any meaningful amount of time. It’s been about two days with no sign of getting better. Sleep is all I really want to do. I’m going through something and all I want to do is sleep through it. I can’t actively change my situation, I just have to play the waiting game for a while. Nothing can keep my attention for long, not even my favorite games. This’ll sound dramatic but I feel like i’m being tortured. Constantly awake without anything stimulating to do. Sleepy but not being able to sleep. I also have anxiety. I’m in hell. Weed helps me sleep but I can’t afford it right now. I feel like I want to die! (because I can’t sleep, not because i can’t get high) Is it possible to OD on melatonin? I’ve taken 2 1/2. Honestly not even sure what mg they are. If anyone has any tips I’ll gladly listen.
Signal	Hey all.. i need your help and advice.I am having a really wierd sleep problem that prevents me reaching deep sleep.Im male 22, and i usually workout every second day. But one day during this corona lockdown, i said to my self im going to be really productive and that day i worked out twice.. I was really tired and stressed that day also and before going to sleep i did one round of Wim Hof breathing tehnique, while i was having a mild anexiety attack cause of all the stress. After that i went to sleep and problems started to happen.When ever i was about to fall asleep i would get hypnagogic jerks that would shock my body, instantly waking me up, giving adrenalin rush, anxiety and heart paltipations. I tried to ignore it and go back to sleep but it happened again and again. I couldnt sleep that night at all. For the whole week after that i had a same problem every night, i could not sleep at all, only light sleep...In the morning i would feel pulsing in my stomach along with heart paltipations. I also got sleep anexiety cause i started to be afraid of the shocks. My doctor checked my heart and aorta and everything was fine. He told me to supplement with more vitamin D and magnesium.After a two weeks of it happening, my sleep pattern completly changed, like my body was adapting to remove the shocks and to give me some rest. Now when i go to sleep i imidiatlly black out and wake up after 3 hours... After that i cant even try to fall asleep, i can only rest and have some half dreams, but because of that i dont get the jolts and adrenalin rushes. My stomach startes to suffer to, i get symptoms of IBS typeA.What the f*** is wrong with me and what exaclly caused this to happen?Is it cause of the hyperventialting wimhof breathing tehnique i did in the stressed state?Did i somehow damaged my vagus nerve (*abdominal pulse in the morning)?Maybe i got centerlized sleep apnea? I noticed for the first time this morning i woked up cause i was gasping for breath when i tried to fall asleep.Please help!
Signal	Hey guys. I cannot begin to describe the depths of despair insomnia brought into my life. Like a lot of you, I went through the whole charade of being convinced I had the fatal form, to suicidal thoughts. I felt as though everything was being taken from me, and I felt I was unique in my suffering. I even picked up a false diagnosis of bipolar mania along the way though this journey. I'm back on here to say the cure for your insomnia is mediation. Every single one of you will be cured through mindfulness meditation. It is a permanent solution to not only insomnia, but all of your life circumstances. You are not unique in your sufferings. Insomnia is one of the best things that has ever happened to me, as It forced me into surrender, into such depths of hell that I shattered my ego and no longer identify with any of my thoughts. I was sleeping 3 to 4 hours every other night for a long time. Now, I sleep 8 hours or more. I no longer am afraid to come on here and read these posts, as I no longer fear insomnia. It is all in your mind, and It was all in mine as well. It took me a long time to realize this, but even after I knew it was in my mind, it took a long time to be able to deidentify and be cured. Meditation is not a quick fix, it takes many months of dedication. But the results will come and they are limitless. I sit here with pure elation, feeling as though I took 2 benzos, but I didn't. Everything is new to me, and amazing. Many months ago I was just like you. I am not some weirdo. I was an average guy stuck in my mind and suffering terribly from insomnia and a nervous breakdown. No one can show you the way. I cannot tell you how. All I can do is tell you this is the best thing that ever happened to you, if you let it be the catalyst to awakening.
Signal	I'm dealing with a shitty cocktail of the 3 right now. 2 nights ago i slept 3.5 hours, last night 1.5. between the past 4 days ive maybe gotten 9 hours of very interrupted sleep. it all started to go downhill after a weekend of binge drinking. terrible hangover, diarrhea, dyspepsia acting up again. gastric symptoms have improved somewhat, but i have had little to no appetite dor weeks. more solid bowel movements. i'm so so so tired and exhausted but nothing i do seems to actually get me to sleep. i just recently restarted sertraline at a low dose for my anxiety per my doctor's instructions but i know that can take weeks to kick in. previously i had tried 3mg melatonin and .25mg klonopin prescribed by my psychiatrist... no luck. last night i took no klonopin or melatonin just some sleepy time tea. most of the time i feel myself get close to falling asleep i get this shitty adrenaline rush. my pcp and my psychiatrist (as well as everyone else in my life) seem to be convinced that this is all anxiety driven on a feedback loop. has anyone else experienced anything similar? also i already have intense fears and reservations about taking most meds, so you know how desperate i have to be to have taken what i have so far. i remain fairly unconvinced any meds are going to help me. i just want to get some sleep. im so exhausted. any feedback is helpful. thank you.
NotSignal	Hey everyone so recently I haven’t been sleeping too well due to quarantine aggravating my insomnia and then I had a pretty dark self-repressed memory, that I hadn’t thought of in >10yrs, surface and that made it even harder to sleep. Was getting pretty bad despite me taking my meds and talking it over with my therapist and psychiatrist. However last night I was actually able to sleep simply because I slept/cuddle next to someone who I trust and feel safe with. Not an option for everyone especially in light of quarantine but I wanted to share cause I woke up feeling refreshed for the first time in 2 weeks. Anyways I hope everyone can find a way to get some sleep. That being said I know cbd is more popular now and can really help some people. Particular with anxiety and stress to make it easier to sleep. So does anyone have recommendations on a specific cbd oil or vape or are they all the same?
Signal	I've had insomnia for at least 3-4 years now. I am on my 5th sleeping pill this year, and none of them have worked. Lately it's been so bad that I've maybe had 7 collective hours of (light) sleep in the past 4 days.Can anyone with previous sleep problems recommend a REALLY good mattress that made a difference? I think it may be part of the problem, because I toss and turn ALL night, and when I visited my sister in March, I slept much better on her guest bed. It had a good mattress pad but it doesn't have a tag left on it so we don't know the brand. But I'm looking to invest in a brand new mattress instead of a pad, so I could use recommendations! Preferably with a money-back trial period?
NotSignal	For about a year I was struggling with insomnia where I would go about a week getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night and then would get one good night then repeat the cycle. I tried so many natural supplements, over the counter meds, sleep techniques like going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, meditation, the list goes on. It was taking such a toll on my mental health and I wasn’t feeling like myself. I finally went to my primary care doctor and told him and decided to try prescription medication. At first it still wasn’t helping but after increasing my dose I have been sleeping 7-8 hours a night for the past month and I can’t believe how quickly I feel my mental health has bounced back and feeling like myself again. Just wanted to share to remind people there’s so many different techniques out there to try and to not give up!
Signal	hello everyone! I've had bad insomnia for 2 months now and it's only getting worse. last night was particularly bad and although I got 3 hours of sleep, it was the worst my anxiety had ever been. I ended up writing all my thoughts down because the sleep anxiety was blocking everything else out, and I decided to post it here just to see if anyone else could relate and have some comfort that they're not alone, since this seems to be a common problem among insomniacs. it's pretty long though, so if you don't want to read it that's fine with me.tl;dr: my sleep anxiety has replaced tiredness as an automatic response at night, and everything i've tried doesn't work anymore. \-----------------------------------------------------my sleep anxiety has become an unconscious, involuntary feeling and reaction to the point where it clouds all other thoughts and takes over my mind at night. it’s almost as if my body and brain want to be awake as opposed to being asleep. melatonin and benadryl no longer work. cognitive therapies such as CBTI and meditation don’t work anymore and i’ve stopped doing them. it’s as if this anxiety has replaced sleep. i feel so sleepy but awake at the same time and it’s terrible. i’m so angry and frustrated and it’s as if i’m having a panic attack. however, i cannot do anything about any of this as anxiety has become an involuntary, uncontrollable thought that prevents focus. it’s the same thing every night: i go to bed and rest, maybe watch tv, read, or listen to music. i feel sleepy, as though i could nod off right then and there. i get up to turn everything off, plug my phone in, set my alarm. i lay down. then suddenly, my mind and body wakes up as if it’s the morning and i’ve had my coffee. i lay in bed for an eternity worrying about sleeping, and then at 4 am i get up because i’m just too awake. i try to study and watch lectures for the next day, but i can’t focus because i’m too angry about not sleeping yet again. i know i won’t sleep tonight so i sit crisscrossed on top of my bed, staring at the clock in front of me, letting my racing thoughts run around. they never tire or reach the finish line. as the sun rises, i start thinking about what i have to do during the day and the mundane tasks i’ll have to do for school. oddly enough, thinking about school, projects, exams, and clubs is much more calming than thinking about sleep. i finally feel sleepy, but guess what? it’s almost time to start the day. oh well. i guess i’ll try another time, but i know worrying about sleep is more unconscious than actually falling asleep now, so why bother? even if i think about other things like school to take my mind off of sleep anxiety, i’ll still unconsciously worry about it because the thoughts take over my mind when i want to sleep. i try to think of a story or anything else but i can’t. my mind knows i’m trying not to think about not sleeping and does not take the bullshit. so it makes the thought more apparent as if it’s mocking me. strangely i don’t feel tired during the day, and i can focus on schoolwork fine. perhaps the previous night’s adrenaline rush is enough to fuel me for the day, or maybe it’s the video games i play when i take breaks, or maybe it’s both. i remember the nights where i slept easily for up to 12 hours and how i’d complain about sleeping too much. i want those days back lol. i feel that if i were physically at school instead of staying home i’d be able to sleep better. on campus, if i wanted to go to bed at any time i could, and walking around all day, being busy, and seeing friends made me more tired at night.it is currently 6 am. i have to get up in 3 hours. i’m sleepy. should i sleep or not sleep? if i try, i’ll probably feel awake again like what happens when i initially feel “sleepy” at midnight. i want to stop this endless cycle of sleep anxiety, as it’s the only thing preventing me from sleeping. i want to get help from my parents, but all they tell me is to stop playing video games and hanging out with friends (virtually), as they believe those are the culprits. i don’t think the same. i want to see a doctor and maybe get a sleep study, but it’ll be a waste of money because all they’re going to do is tell me i have insomnia and give me a cocktail of anti-depressants/psychotics to get hooked on. no matter what though, i will never be able to trick my mind into falling asleep, because the feeling of sleep anxiety is just more familiar than sleep itself. it has become a nightly cycle of endless worrying. in fact, i have a feeling that i’m unconsciously worrying about this during the day, and it’s just suppressed because i have better things to do. it surfaces at night because the trigger is sleep. or trying to, anyways. perhaps someday, i will get a full night’s sleep. the sleep deprivation will catch up to me at some point and knock me out, even with the sleep anxiety trying to keep me awake.\----------------------------------------------------after last night, i've accepted my fate and that i probably won't get a good night's rest anymore. i figured if that's the case, it's better and more restful to just lay down and at least close my eyes, listen to my thoughts, and relax every night instead of focusing so much on sleep.i apologize for this post being so long, and i hope it at least gave someone some comfort knowing that they're not alone in this fight.
NotSignal	it gives me more anxiety and makes it harder to sleep for me. does anyone else have this problem
NotSignal	I literally feel like I'm going to drop dead. and honestly I'd welcome it. The worst part is If I only had a little weed I could fall asleep. 4 hours a night for a week and 2 1/2 hours last night is not enough.Fuck!
NotSignal	Apparently "normal" people with no sleeping problems just sleep through the night.My sleep cycles are fragmented. Once I fall asleep, I'll awake 2.5hrs later, then try to go to sleep again, only to wake again 2.5hrs later. I repeat this cycle 3-4 times a night. I never feel well rested.How would you diagnose this? What's wrong with me?
Signal	Just got put on seroquel to try and aid my short term insomnia issues... anyone else have experience with this? any luck? i’m a little nervous!
Signal	Hi, Some background: 33 MaleThe latest 4-6 years I've been unable to sleep longer than 5-6 hours per night in most (but not all) nights. I wake up and my brain starts racing, my body feel more alerted to a way that re-sleeping is out of the question. (I'm not gonna explain it more in detail since I'm surrounded by you guys.... :-) Before starting with meds I atleast want to try supplements/OTC. What are some ideas? Is this idea completely crazy: I don't have any major problems falling as sleep. Since I wake up atleast 1 time for a bathroom visit, would it be effective to take a pill Melatonin + Valerian Root? To extend/deepening my sleep. My "fear" is that if I take the pills early in the night, it doesn't help me with the issue of getting awake 5 hours later. I'm happy to have found this sub with like-minded people. Thanks! :)
Signal	So for the past 9 months, I've had severe insomnia that I attribute to a stressful month in my life. However, after the stressor was gone, my insomnia continued and I developed sleep anxiety along with migraines. I've always had generalized anxiety and the physical symptoms have manifested themselves differently over the years. . .I want to say I first experienced physical symptoms of anxiety about 20 years ago (I'm 38 y/o now) . . . manifesting itself through dry heaves when anxious. That symptom went away after about 2 years of suffering and the next physical symptom was that I had a hard time waking up and finding motivation to do anything (in hindsight this may have been depression and not anxiety). I suffered from that for about 1 year and then it went away. Then I had throat spasms and weird throat sensations that I thought might be acid reflux but an endoscopy revealed nothing and it was attributed to anxiety and that eventually went away after a couple months.Even though I have suffered from anxiety for a long time, this is the first time I've experienced insomnia as a result and it's been REALLY severe. For the past 9 months, I've gone through week in and week out of having at least a couple completely sleepless nights followed by nights I get decent 6-7 hours of sleep when my body is completely exhausted and crashes, even though I've developed migraines when lying down and I can still feel anxious about sleep. I had an MRI done and no medical causes for the migraines. I do, however, have high blood pressure that I take blood pressure medication for. From my past experience with SSRIs such as Lexapro or ant-anxiolytics such as Buspar/Buspirone, they've made me even more agitated and anxious and induced full-on panic attacks and my blood pressure would sky rocket. So I've been a little hesitant to go down the path of these anti-depressant type medications to deal with the insomnia as I've had bad experiences with them from the side effects. However, I know that sleeping pills and benzos aren't great long-term solutions. I'm trying to wean myself off 600 mg Gabapentin and 12.5 mg Seroquel as I felt like it helped a little at the beginning of my migraine/insomnia path but not really doing much these days. I've tried so many prescription medications and natural supplements, including Trazodone, Melatonin, Ambien, Ativan, Magnesium, sleepy time tea, but nothing really sticks other than possibly Ambien and Ativan which are in the aforementioned sleeping pills/benzo class that are not great long term solutions.I've also tried all sorts of natural anxiety reducing steps such as exercising, sleep hygiene, CBTI, acupuncture, prayer/mediation, therapy, etc. but nothing seems to work and almost seems worse because I'm putting insomnia on a pedestal and giving it more attention. I used to be a fairly good sleeper before all this started 9 months ago with only temporary bouts of acute insomnia here and there but now I feel so desperate and broken. Sorry for the long post, but I just wanted to write out my frustrations to see if it helps reduce the anxiety somewhat and see if it resonated with any readers out there that may be experiencing similar issues.
Signal	I explained that I’m very very worried that despite following a very strict schedule and the fact I’m on medication (0.25-0.5mg of Xanax), I’m still having nights where I am up way over 24 hours. He explained I shouldn’t be and that since his approach isn’t working (as it sounds work for everybody) we should suspend our relationship. I’ve been up almost 26 hours and can’t stop crying. I’m working so hard at this, have another counselor for regular CBT, am looking into an outpatient program, and working closely with my doctor. I’m convinced this point that I have sporadic fatal insomnia and he wouldn’t even ease my mind about it and no one will give me a PET scan. My insomnia is getting significantly worse after years of it and significantly fast - I forgot my phone number this past week and my husbands birthday even WITH SLEEP. It’s freaking me out - I pride myself on such a good memory. I don’t know what to do but I’m having to quit my job and I’m about to just snap mentally. I literally can’t stop crying. The sun is up and I’m exhausted and not even Xanax is putting me to sleep. I’m terrified at the thought of being awake for 18 months until I die. I just know something isn’t normal medically.
NotSignal	It feels like I am shocked or something similar. Can't sleep.
Signal	I drank a 5g melatonin last night and still get any sleep. I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Signal	So back in April-May I stopped being able to sleep for usually 4 days at a time. I'd fall asleep for an hour, rinse and repeat.. always about 4 days. I didn't realize this then, and i'm not proud to admit it, but I think my extreme insomnia was a result of the covid lockdown making all my drug connects quickly disappear. I've been sober for 2 months, I'm happy now, and I feel pretty much recovered.When I first left the hospital for an insomnia induced nightmare scenario they gave me trazadone and remeron. neither of them worked, and i'm assuming it's because of my extended detox. Out of the blue I discovered benadryl worked perfectly. There isn't a pill out there that doesn't feel like it effects me the next day.. but at this point I'm so terrified of going back to the insomnia hell that I feel like I need something to sleep. A lot of things I used to love were ruined from my month of not sleeping. For instance, I used to be an avid fan of this old radio show (the R.G show) lthat I listened to for years every single night.. but if i listen to even 5 seconds of it now it takes me back to my no sleep month which was single handedly the darkest time of my life. last week i developed an extremely runny nose and sneezing at work and was ordered to stay home for 7 days due to covid. The first thing I thought was "well i've been taking benadryl for 3 weeks.. now is my chance to come off of it" I tried taking just melatonin and I didn't fall into the sleep-like coma benadryl gave me.. so I started taking trazadone for 4 nights in a row which knocked me out without even realizing I was falling asleep. I desperately want natural sleep because when I take benadryl or trazadone I feel tired and out of it the next day. I've completely changed my life style. I used to lay in bed all day depressed and now I go on 3 runs a day and do busy work all day. but the nights I don't take either pill and just melatonin after 2 hours I notice I have the blanket covering my head thinking "man... im not falling asleep" so i say screw it.A part of me wants to be done with the pills. Maybe I won't sleep for 4 or 5 nights and have to go to work during all of it but i don't know. sorry for the long post.
NotSignal	I just want to sleep. Drugs don't work. Drink doesn't work. I'm becoming a mean person. I don't want to be a hateful person. I really just want to sleep and to have some peaceful dreams. How did I make Morpheus so angry. Please let me sleep.
Signal	Yesterday I had to take twice the Clonazepam dose I'm used to PLUS Eszopiclone 2mg.All this because I drunk a coke and eat chocolates. I'm sure this was the cause, because it's not the first neither second neither third time. lolBut WHY? What's wrong with my liver or brain? I'm a slow caffeine metabolizer or do I have low adenosine brain levels?!No psichiatrist or neurologist ever found out.
Signal	this is my 24th consecutive hour without sleep and no matter what i do i’m not even the slightest bit tired. i took far too much melatonin and benadryl and then hit my wax pen a good bit and i still cannot sleep. i’ve also had a constant migraine and normally i’m passed out asleep in pain with migraines but today i was away for all of it
Signal	I can’t take this anymore. This whole day I’ve only slept 4 hours, was tired as hell the entire day, then I went to sleep earlier than usual so that I can get proper sleep and fix my schedule. At 12:50 AM I got in my bed, took a natural sleeping pill with plants and whatnot, didn’t help at all, was awake the whole time, then after 2 hours I took 3 mg of melatonin, and after an hour or so I finally fell asleep... for like 30-40 minutes and woke up for no reason. Took another 3 mg melatonin, nothing. It’s 5 am now. So it’s about time I have to use my last resort, which is trazodone, but I have an empty stomach and last time I ate something was 6 hours ago, is that alright? Should I take or not?
NotSignal	I'm tired of watching the dark sky turn lighter until I hear the birds chirping. I'm tired of slowly seeing my room get brighter and seeing everything in it become visible to the eye. I'm tired of feeling hopeless and restless. I'm tired of living like this. I'm tired of being tired.
NotSignal	I was wondering what it should be, in a relation of use less mg possible to achieve the desired effect...
NotSignal	my body clock has shifted to 5am-1pm. tried to 'reset' it by not sleeping til the next day and managed to stay up til 8pm and slept, hoping to lock it as new bedtime.next day i'm still up at 2am 🤷🏽‍♂️ this used to work. Now i just feel hopeless.
NotSignal	Hi All, I've had this problem for close to 10 years now. I wake up when I dream. I have a fitbit which tracks my sleep (I know they're not the most accurate). I go through stages of REM sleep and don't wake up (maybe i do but i dont notice it), but as soon as i start dreaming, i wake up. This isn't like a nightmare or anything, but any sort of dream and i will physically wake up. Obviously this has messed my sleep up for close to 10 years now. I've tried pretty much every OTC drug there is. I also had an acid episode which i believe has fried a few receptors in my brain. Before the acid episode (which was a year ago) certain stuff like magnesium, taurine, etc would knock me out (even though it wasn't good sleep). But now, no matter what i take, i will always wake up after 3-4 hours once i start dreaming. It's easy for me to go back to sleep. But this fragmented sleep has been taking a toll on my life - the eyebags definitely show it. Does this happen to anyone else? Are there any things that people can suggest which may help or is there like a condition / disease? I literally wake up no matter what when i dream. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
NotSignal	My best friend called me and asked the usual mundane questions,”hi!” “How are you?” Blah blah...Then she asked how I was sleeping? I told that I wasn’t and when I do, I am plagued with night terrors. I spend my nights pacing in my room, going to the gym or wandering around my neighborhood. My best friend replied that I was scaring her. My lack of sleep and night terrors had to be taking a toll on me. And she is worried about my mental and physical health. I don’t say that I don’t disagree but I don’t know what to do.
NotSignal	First night without nightmares/night sweats after ending 20 year weed habit 10 months ago. Got my appetite back. First meal in months without bloating, indigestion, nausea. Mood seems to be stabilising. Let's hope its not a fluke. Will report back.P. S. I've not been able to take "traditional" pharmaceuticals due to bad reactions to SSRI's.
Signal	I had some sleep problems before, I could go to sleep no problem but was always up 2-3 hours later. Sometimes I’d go back to sleep, sometime not. Discovered alcohol could be causing it so I stopped completely.I was definitely drinking too much, I went through 1.75-2 liters of vodka a week, drinking from when I got home from work to going to bed. Since I stopped I’ve been in hell, I had one night fell asleep at 4am for 4 hours, and the last two nights nothing. The anxiety and panic is just increasing. I’m crying, shaking and having mild panic attacks. I feel like this is never going to pass, and I’m fooling myself that is withdrawal symptoms?
NotSignal	Whenever I'm at the edge of falling asleep, my brain somehow moves a random muscle in my body which results me waking up and losing the urge to sleep. It keeps happening several times before i fully fall asleep. sometimes nothing moves but I get something in my chest like the feeling you get when falling from a building in a dream,it wakes me up as well. Could anyone please explain what happening? It's been 4 years.
NotSignal	It's 5 am and I feel sleepy Should I go to sleep or not sleep to fix my sleep schedule?If I go to sleep should I wake up early or late?
NotSignal	Today we are trying extra strength (store brand) unisom. Apparently 2x strength of zzquill. We will see...
NotSignal	Okay, so first off, this isn't gonna be the most articulate thing you've read on here. It would have been as I just spent about 15 minutes writing it but my phone slipped, I tried to catch it and refreshed the page towards the end of the post...Anyway, basically after years of late night gaming and working unsociable hours I have next to no sleep pattern, 3 solid hours is a good sleep for me. Every now and again though I get phases where I don't even get that, an example being about 4 weeks back when I only had 9 hours total for the week. When this happens and I start to feel sleep deprived I get weird dreams, and tonight happened to be one of those times. Between 12-2am I was in and out of sleep, but still falling into the same recurring dream. I would come to outside a big ass scarface style mansion, you know the Miami drug lord style you see on TV. Being I live in Scotland I only have game and movie references to go off of though. So here I am standing wondering what is going on before I am surrounded by a shit ton of guys all rambling non-sensically, the only things I pick up on are "catch it" and "be careful". They push me through these giant steel reinforced doors which lock behind me. I look around the foyer, seems what you'd expect from a rich guys mansion, tong of book cases, big grand piano in the corner of the room, the usual mansion stuff really (Not that I've ever seen one in person). I get bored fast and walk to the next room. This room would be the same, except for the fact it has been trashed. The bookshelves are all smashed up, there are giant claw marks on the walls bigger than me and a massive hole in the ceiling. I say a whole lot of no to this room and advance forward. In a rush to get out I enter the next room, which looks entirely entact, giving me a false sense of security, cause the second I shut the door I see it. Crouched behind the door was this 7 foot tall, 20 foot long tiger, fangs on show. I locked eyes with it and no sooner than I had it had already took a swing at me, cleaving me into pieces. I didn't actually feel anything but you know those dreams where you fall then you have that crazy jumping waking up thing where your heart stops and you just panic? Well yeah it was like that. Before all my pieces even managed to hit the floor I open my eyes and I am standing back outside the mansion, that's right all my otaku nerds out there, it's a Re:Zero type dream.For anyone who doesn't know what that is, Re:Zero is an issekai anime where the MC wakes up in another world, stuff happens and he dies, but when he dies he awakes back in the other world, the only one who can remember anything that happened. I used to call refer to them as game dreams as it was like a respawn until I saw that little gem.So back to the dream, instantly I realise what is going on, I know I am dreaming and it is one of these loop system dreams. I have some control but not all, for instance I still have to follow the dream but I can take my time and interact with little stuff. I decide okay, I know it's a dream so f**k it here we go. I decide to just charge ahead all guns blazing (athough I have no guns) the next few attempts play out similar to the first, with differences like the tiger being in different places, killing me different ways, but every time it happens I get a little further. Just like life in a sense, the more you fail, the more you learn and can push forward. Eventually I come to this room, slightly different as it looks like it has been abandoned for years and is overgrown with greenery. I see the tiger again, but instead of chomping down on me this time it is just lying down in the room. I notice a metal pipe sticking out if it's side, I dunno if this happened while smashing up the place or if there are other people in here too that have shanked it with a pipe. Coincidentally enough this room is huge, like 15-20 foot tall with full length windows and a ladder beside them. Being the long time gamer that I am I look outside the box here, the tiger has locked eyes with me but seems to have given up already, so instead of finishing it off I look to make a powerful ally here. I climb the ladders, unhook the curtains for the windows and throw them down beside the tiger. I walk over, grab the pipe and yank it out of it's side. I quickly wrap the curtains over the behemoth and use them as a makeshift turnicate, tying them tightly to apply pressure to the wound and ease the bleeding (hey, video game logic at its finest). As I finish up I hear a bang at the door as it gets kicked in. Before I get a chance to turn around I hear another bang, then my vision goes in my right eye, I hit the floor and realise I've just had half my face blown off. I come to outside the mansion again, understandably a bit pissed off I have to start all over again as unlike with Re:Zero or games I don't get a checkpoint, but hey, still in the dream so what else can I do. I make my way back to the room, same plan as before but first I use the tables and chairs in the room to barricade the door, and as planned, it works. I help the now giant thankful pussycat, hear a bang, but the door doesn't open, instead it's just shouting from the other side. My newfound friendly feline friend nudges at me, as if to say come on (apparently now I can understand a tigers thought process) so I climb onto and he scales up the book cases into a hole in the wall leading to the upper levels of the apparent death house we are dealing with. I mean honestly you'd think with the way it moved the whole pipe thing was just him faking it. Anyway we're in behind the walls, just following along a narrow pathway, quietly as we can hear tons of angry shouting coming from the other sides. We see a light ahead, so seeing as I am the MC of my dream I decide I'll take the lead, I hop down and signal the tiger to hold back (apparently tigers now understand the human thought process too) then I head out to the light. It's an open rooftop area, again overgrown with greenery which sits against the side of a cliff leading into what looks like a jungle. I signal him out and tell him we have to make a run for it. Without hesitation he jumps up the cliff and f**ks off (knew there was a reason I am more of a dog person) leaving me stuck here. I see a single door across the rooftop so figure that's where I have to go. Walking towards it I hear shouting and gunshots coming towards me, apparently this means I now become Nathan Drake cause I start sprinting across the roof, hurdling over obstacles and dodging gunfire. As I get to the door I hear another bang, I look down and someone has shot me through the door in the chest. At this point I almost s**t my pants as I wake up nearly falling out the bed. So yeah...I have no idea why I get these dreams or if they mean anything, maybe it was cause I just finished the last of us 2 the other night and my brain needed the excitement since I had nothing today. Believe it or not my first Re:Zero type dream I was dropped in a forest and had to escape Jason, yeah, the hockey mask wearing, machete wielding Jason... This was about 10 years back too way before the Friday the 13th game was ever a thing. So seeing as how I've been unable to sleep since that I figured I'd share my weird ass dream with you lot, maybe somebody out there will have something similar or just appreciate the read.
Signal	it started last may 25th i ate a heavy meal then tried to sleep which resulted in no sleep at all. the next night i took a medicine sinupret and seemed to help me fall asleep and i ended up sleeping for 10 hours and then the next night i can’t sleep again(i didn’t take the sinupret) and right now i am trying to sleep i even excercised 5 hours ago and still i can’t sleep. how can i finally sleep?
Signal	I will present to you, the repetitive nature of my everyday struggle and the fight against a downright cursed sleeping condition.And i will do so, by talking about the usual behavioural pattern that I strive to maintaint and improve almost every evening.We shall pay attention to the following narrative : It is 8 o clock in the evening and I had just finished everything that I had to do with my daytime activities such as playing on my computer; watching an online series; editing pictures or even eating(only sometimes at that hour sometimes).I have to specify that I have moved from Romania to England almsot two years ago, where I lived in a small city which made me happy due to its geographical placement next to the black sea, which by definition would be fun to live next to when taking in consideration the physical activities I could partake in(in which i often did, on a daily basis). Some of the daily outside activities did not even includ the sea funnily enough. I would bike around, walk along the coast or even run(not to often due to my iliotibial band syndrome), go camping in the forest or have training sessions in the nature. Back to my initial experience though, as I have said, the day officially ended. I slowly start doing relaxing activities so to speak. Activities that include meditating, stretching or taking a hot shower. After approximately one hour - from 8 to 9 in the evening - I get enough courage (I use the word courage due to the unusual and recently traumatic experience of being scared to go to bed) to put myself to bed.I lie down slowly, paying lesser attention to my anxious mind and starting to concentrate on my deep nose breathing technique that I use to calm me down and offer something to concentrate instead of letting my anxious mind uncontrollably take over my whole being. In the matter of minutes I start to feel a slight eye discomfort as if, my eyes are sinking into my sockets, towards the back of my head.After this unusual eye pressure and heaviness I start to feel like my eyes are severely dry and I feel as I should try to blink with my eyes closed in order for some magical relief which finally occcurs due to the aggressive nature of this unusually dry itchiness. On the other hand, trying to sleep without at least blinking once(while having my eyes closed) would be almost impossible and it would mean a great deal of additional effort from me. I find myself trapped between not blinking and trying to fight against the urge which most of the times results in horrific failure or, rarely success. But even with succeeding in this ugly task , does not mean that I am being granted the possibility of sleep, it means that I have to fight on, in order to reach another stage of my pathetic attempt. The omnipresent awareness and alertness of my mind while trying my best to descend into the land of partial unconsciousness, (which surprisingly enough I manage to breach despite of the severe manifestation of my brain) is trying to slowly drag away any hope I have left. Fast forward one or two hours and I finally taste (for the lack of a better word) success! My stubborn attempt of basically laying down, breathing long and deep while keeping an open minded attitude and not beating myself down into the dirt for a situation that seems to be out of my control has come to fruition! Until one unfortunate moment during the night when I come to the realisation that I have only won a battle, but the war must indefinitely go on. I am awake! I awfully think to myself in an involuntary matter as I try my best to ignore the bizarre, dark undertone of my issue. In a few seconds I start feeling alert again, as if the sun has stubbornly breached my dark blue curtain and invaded the room, but reality was different. I waited for about another 40 minutes or more while softly breathing and thinking to myself that I will go back to sleep in a couple of minutes and everything will be alright, I will receive my well deserved rest. Curiosity takes over me and I finally check my watch which I most of the times wear even if I am sleeping or attempting to. I look down, pressing the button that lights the screen of my watch and realise that I ve probably only slept for 4 hours or less because it is either 2 or 3, sometimes 4 in the morning. After finding out and dissolving my suspicious mind, I inevitably go back to trying, despite of the fact that my eyes hurt, I do not feel tired or sleepy at all, and I always jave to urinate, and when I do, the quantity makes me feel even more frustrated, as if my body tried its best to gather the last amount of liquid in my body and spit it out, leaving me dehydrated in the process. After another couple of hours trying and trying, it feels more and more frustrating and I reach the point of laying in bed until my alarm goes of at 6 or 7 depending on how confident I felt last night while setting up the troublesome alarm. Half of the times when I reach this chapter of my story, I am so tired and disappointed from fighting against myself for hours on end, that I actually feel some type of sleepiness, and getting out of bed seems impossible and I inevitably fall to sleep for another 2 or 3 hours and all of this ends in waking up at 10 in the morning or later if I let myself do so. Other times, I am unable to even fall asleep after a long a draining battle like the one that I have just laid down and I get myself up and face the day until I have to repet the same process again. The worst period of time for this demon to manifest itself is when I am working, due to the fact that I have to wake up at 4 in the morning to face a tall and long 12 hour working day in a warehouse only to come home and face the same problem that completely ignores the fact that I have been constantly moving and pushing for the last 12 hours. The frustration I feel goes beyond my capacity to express myself, my obsession for healthy living adds an extra layer of trauma. Just imagining a future in which I avoid any alcohol, any added or processed sugar and I work out regularly, but sleep is no where in sight makes me feel like all the effort that I am directing towards bettering myself is more than pointless. I have thought about what could cause this whole situation, and yes... My childhood sexual traumas, my pure obsessional obsessive compulsive disorder and my anxiety disorder, hand in hand with my schizophrenic tendencies could be the major cause of this long going war but for this to be the only reason(my mental health condition), it would be to act in a subconscious way, because when I go to bed, the only manifestation of my negativ mental situation is the slightly discomforting anxiety that has build up due to going through this weird sleeping experiment and failing for far too long.Scared for my health and for the possibility of living the life of a chronically stressed out person, without the possibility of relaxing in the most natural way possible. I am fated to face this never ending uphill battle against myself.You will have to exuse my grammar mistakes if you find any, I am writing this in the midst of a sleepless night.
Signal	Accounts and testimonials? Long story short. I drank almost every night for sleep up until a week ago. Its been harder to fall asleep since, but I won't revert. I found an old Lunesta (2mg) perscription in my nightstand. I remember it not working to well but wondering if it might help somewhat. Thoughts? Suggestions? What are your experiences with Lunesta? I also have an old Ambien script (10mg) but if I remember corrently, Ambien was basically a sugar pill to me. Lunesta didn't do much but I did feel a boost in sleep onset somewhat with it. (2 years ago)
NotSignal	Does anyone have this issue at night? This started 4 days ago in the middle of the night. It’s always when I start to slip off into sleep, then I lose my breath and I jolt up because it feels like my heart stopped. Does anyone know what this could be?
NotSignal	When I’m at my house (my house is near a creek with frogs that I listen to to sleep) I sleep great. But I’m staying in the city right now where all I can hear are semis driving all night. Any helpful tips for sleeping better while I’m here? Not sure if it’s the sounds or not, but I’m going to try to sleep with frog sounds playing tonight and I’ll update you.
NotSignal	Really sorry. I'm a little stressed. So I'm now sensitive to any light at night. We black out every single light possible, and hero partner got me a eye mask for the mornings.So my body will ache and itch in every place it wants the moment I get comfortable. So I ridyself of itches and my partner rolls over so I don't keep them awake. I even have a extra pillow between my legs so I might ache less.So I relax and let my mind wander, and that's when my brain hits me with all the stupid shit that I haven't been thinking about, nor do I want to be thinking about at this moment. So I try to exhaust the thought out so it doesn't have an excuse to stay.So I try and drift again, and now my partner is snoring their brains out. Not a rhythm in place, not one style in mind. They're like an orchestra but it's one person playing every instrument, even the triangle!So I move to the spare room. I read one of my fave books to calm down and the BIGGEST MOFO SPIDER you have ever seen starts to stroll over in the direction of the bed. So I spend more time aamping myself up to get it and chuck the spider out the window.But now I am paranoid about a new spider showing up.I'm tiredI'm stressedI'm sadI wanna sleepAnd I want my doctors just just believe I'm not aan idiot and prescribe me some bloody pills to knock me out. All I want is to sleep.And a hug.
NotSignal	i started smoking on a daily basis, mostly at night less than a year ago and it’s always knocked me out. I’ve always had vivid dreams and unlike many smokers i continued having and remembering my dreams. however, whenever i don’t smoke at night i end up staying up for hours. At 3 or 4am I usually give up and smoke a bowl to put me out. I love smoking at night but i hate that i might be dependent on it. does anyone (esp smokers) have advice on how i can still enjoy weed in a healthy way without it wrecking my natural sleep? how long will my withdrawals last?
NotSignal	Hey, I've been struggling with insomnia for the past year or so. It started relatively light, with one or two bad nights a week. It didn't effect me at all. This carried on for a few months. I did wonder why that was the case, but I wasn't worried. Now, 2020's been a nightmare. Almost every night I've been awake until at least 1:30am and now I'm awake at 4am. I've accepted it now, which has helped me control it and I'm lucky to have the luxury of when to get up, but I seem to have at least one really bad night (3 hours or less/no sleep) at least once a month too, which really breaks me. I've increased my exercise by a hell of a lot - in fact I actually went on a 4 HOUR walk today (no kidding) and yet tonight's turned out to be "that night" I'm open to any suggestions as I'm fed up with this now. Thanks.
NotSignal	Hi guys. I don’t know if this is the proper place to ask this. For the past 2 weeks or so, I haven’t fallen asleep before 5 am. It’s currently 6:20 am, I’ve been in bed since 10 pm last night and haven’t even come close to sleeping. I’m already diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder with obsessive compulsive tendencies, borderline personality disorder, and trichotillomania. I really don’t feel like adding on another diagnosis of insomnia. I do feel tired, I just can’t sleep. I don’t feel extra anxious, just the normal amount. I haven’t had any panic attacks recently. I don’t think this would be considered “mania” seeing as I have no other symptoms to prove it. I can’t figure out for the life of me why I can’t sleep. Luckily I stopped working about a month ago so it’s not really interfering with my life that much. But I know it’s really unhealthy to just not sleep. I’ve tried Benadryl recently and it doesn’t help me at all. I’ve also used Xanax to try to fall asleep since it is prescribed to me for my anxiety. Is there anything else I can do? Could my other mental health issues be causing this?
Signal	My partner has had extreme insomnia (and anxiety) that has led to phychosis. He was hospitalized in late may and was released early June. He was hospitalized for about a week. We're in separate beds, have focused on sleep hygiene and he's been taking trazadone. He's done guided sleep meditation, anxiety videos, lavender oil diffuser every thing. Every night I wait for him to fall asleep, so I know he's sleeping some. The only thing that I ask is he wake me up if he wakes up in the night. I do this for several reasons. First I'm tracking his sleep so I know how much he's getting. Second I don't want him to be lonely and scared and I want to comfort him. I'm very blessed to not have struggled with this myself, I can fall back asleep quicky and easily, so he's really not bothering me. Out of the 10 days he's been out of the hospital, hes woken me up twice. I thanked him immediately, and comforted him back to place of relaxation, and waited till he falls back asleep. Most of the other nights he will not wake me up and tell me in the morning how he didn't sleep. Only two nights has he slept the whole night. Last night he didn't wake me up. I'm beyond frustrated. His situation had put a strain on our lives. We are both unemployed because of it. It's not his fault, but I don't understand why he won't wake me up for help. What can I do? How can I help him? He hates being hospitalized, and honestly I do too. What is the best course of action?
Signal	I’m a lifelong insomniac. I remember as far back as middle school not being able to sleep. I like to joke that I haven’t slept in 27 years (I’m a 27 year old female). It didn’t bother me much until recently as I’m approaching my 30s. I’ve tried everything on the market and feel I’m out of options. I practice amazing sleep hygiene. I shower 2 hours before bed, don’t eat or exercise at night, read a physical book (not a Kindle) on the couch for an hour or 2 every night before going to bed, eat completely vegan and workout 4-5x per week. I only climb into bed if I’m actually trying to fall asleep. I don’t look at my screen for over an hour before trying to sleep. I’ve tried sleep noises on Spotify and a lavender oil diffuser. I keep my room cool with a fan. It’s far as medications/supplements, I’ve tried every sleep tea on the market. I’ve also tried melatonin, 500 mg of magnesium, every type of cannabis for sleep (to the point where the guys that work at my local dispensary are out of options for me), Tylenol PM, Tylenol with Codeine, Benadryl, and most recently Ambien. None of these substances make me bat an eyelash. I truly don’t know what to do. I maybe sleep lightly for 1 hour each night if I’m lucky but that’s it. I still somehow function working my full time corporate job but I’m not sure how. Can anyone help me please? Yes,I’ve already talked to my doctor multiple times.
Signal	My sleep schedule was fine before school was let out for obvious reasons. At first, it was easy until about 4am, then i usually passed out. Then the next day it was 7am. Messed me up for a while. I had to take naps during the day. I tried so hard to go to sleep. But my body is never tired at night anymore. And I have sleepless nights. Almost every single night I don't get sleep. Then I have to sleep though the day and it fucking sucks. I'm trying so hard to fix it, but I always pass out during the day and make a me like shit that I couldn't go a single day without a stupid nap. I don't know what to do anymore.
Signal	So I have MDD, GAD, Sleep Apnea, Insomnia - some chicken/egg with the latter 3. Also have 3 months of post nasal drip with dry cough.I can't use my CPAP because of the cough/nasal mucus. Can't clear up the issue with Flownase (doc scrip) or Musinex.I was taken off Lexapro and put on Zoloft, and Z has made the insomnia & Depression worse (only 2 weeks in, they say "give it a month").My psych put me on Trazodone for insomnia. Night 1 at 50mg, night 2 at 100mg, only gives me zombie-head. Zz-quill is what actually put me to sleep, but that just makes the nasal drip worse. LOOKING for any feedback that may help guide me to something that can help. Thank you!
NotSignal	I should've taken the melatonin earlier. Hey I hope you guys have a great day. Or sleep whatever time in the world it is for you.
Signal	Im a 25 years old male that started working as a garterner a couple of mounths Ago.. since i started my New job i have suffered from insomnia.. I struggle with a lot of obsessive thinking and have been for years but that has never been a problem due to my sleep.. I fear now my anxiety will be worse if I keep going like this. I sleep 4 hours a night if I'm lucky and I have tried everything from melatonin to cannabis, exercise etc but nothing works I always wake up in the middle of the night and can't sleep anymore.. this is only happening on work days when I'm off I sleep alot better. I really can't take this much more I'm so dizzy when I get out of bed so im thinking about quitting my job for a little while and practicing sleeping properly Any advise? Cheers
NotSignal	This is something very new for me for usually I am on the other side of the spectrum with extreme sleepiness. In fact, I have fallen asleep more than once while eating.But I have been struggling to sleep over the last few days. I had been watching some videos of classic world cup games uploaded by FIFA on youtube over the last 3-4 night. However, surprisingly, I took more than 30 minutes to sleep after the games got over.But the night before the previous one, I just could not sleep through the night in spite of keeping at it for more than 4 hours. Kept my eyes closed, did not get up, thinking that it surely is a matter of time before I fall asleep. But to no avail happen. Soon, I could hear the birds chirp and the room was bright.Last night, it has been worse. I went to sleep religiously at around 2300 hours, had stayed away from computers and mobile after dinner. But I was up by 3 am and have not been able to sleep so far. It is already 0630 now.Is this something others are experiencing? Does lack of exposure to sunlight, lack of movement and isolation cause insomnia?thanks Sorry for my poor English.
NotSignal	Is it possible to hit the gym every day or almost and still get insomnia? Just curious if that's the most effective tool and good for health too
Signal	Hi, I'm a 21 years old male and in the month of May I started developing anxiety after vomiting and feeling a chest pain I started googling symptoms and I found that if you have chest pain after you vomit it could be Boerhaave syndrome ( a rupture of the esophagus) that has a mortality rate of 40 to 60% if treated in 24 hours and if not the mortality rate is 100% after that I become very worried and I've gone to a GP who told me that I have nothing but he made me do a chest x-ray so I could rest, in this period I was sleeping fine between 7 and 8 hours a night but after a few days I started developing this weird sleep pattern where I don't have a problem falling asleep but I wake up after 2-3 hours not feeling like I was sleeping but I know that I slept because I remember a dream I go back to sleep after 15-20 minutes but the same thing happen again and the more i sleep the more my sleep become fragmented and i wake up every hour with more dreams, i feel like i never reach deep sleep this has been my life for the last 25 days it happen regularly every single night. Is this some kind of insomnia?i took magnesium 300 mg for a week it did nothing, and I took hydroxyzine 25 mg but i stopped it after 2 nights it just made me sleep faster but it didn't stop the waking ups and it made me groggy in the morning, did someone suffer something like this before.
NotSignal	I already have insomnia and can’t sleep without my pill but I didn’t take it today cause it gives me an awful fatigue which I don’t need cause I had an exam today and staid up all night studying, BUT WHY CANT I SLEEP ?? WHY AM I NOT TIRED
Signal	For several months I was suffering from only getting 2h to 4h of sleep during weekdays when I'm working. Although my job does not particularly stress me out, I do find myself thinking a lot about work, preventing me from sleeping. I have tried taking melatonin and magnesium, which have helped somewhat but not significantly.Two weeks ago I started taking CBD oil and ever since, I have been getting at least 6h of sleep, sometimes even 8h during the weekend!! Needless to say, I feel like an entirely different person. It's obviously not a guarantee that this will work for everyone, but I thought I'd share what has worked for me.
NotSignal	I have a really hard time falling asleep because my brain becomes so focused on the process of it (ex. What will it feel like to fall asleep, how long will it take, will I notice when I do, etc.)I can’t take melatonin because it gives me nightmares. I usually only successfully fall asleep if I have the tv loud enough to drown out my brain.Is this common for anyone else?
Signal	I have had really bad insomnia for approximately 15 years. I initially begin taking over-the-counter sleep medication, but the effectiveness has diminished over the years. I am now at the point that I take 3 to 4 Unisom a night which at this point only puts me to sleep for about an hour. I recently read that over-the-counter sleep medication can lead to dementia. I want to discontinue over the counter sleep medication but I know I won’t be able to even get the 2 to 3 hours that I get a night without it. Can someone please help me?
Signal	I tipically start to feel really sleepy at 11:30 pm Since three days, (night), every single tinme, my head hits thr bed, I loose all of that sleepiness and become hit with some energy. On 04/20 to 04/21 : Went to bed at 1am Fell asleep at 3:30 AM woke up at 9 am04/21 to 04/22 : went to bed at 1am despite feeling really sleepy. Fell asleep at 6:30 am woke up at 10 am 04/22 to 04/23 : went to bed at 00:30 and now its 5:30 and im not asleep. I don’t think I will fall asleep soon. Im now tolerant to Zopiclone now matter how much dosage I take its doing nothing to my body. Other OTC stuff like ZZZQuil , melatonin, valerian root don’t work either. I’m really desperate , i think i’ll have to go days with no sleep before my body finaly gives up. Can my GP do something about it before I end up in the psych ward because im really going crazy from sleep deprivation??
Signal	Ok I dont know where to start. Ive been insomniac for a long time. But today is just one of the craziest one. I laid on my bed at around 2am and couldnt fall asleep maybe around 9-10 am and woke up at 12:45, despite not getting enough sleep the previous days. Ive been taking this brand of melatonin that doesnt seem quite to work as intended it doesnt seem to reset my sleeping cycle. Yesterday, I tried to increase the doses up to 5mg, well I fell asleep just fine. However, my fvckn boss called me in the morning after 4-5 hrs later asking me if I can go to work early which ruined my sleep. Today, I did the same thing and I just couldnt fall asleep. So many times I just want to hit my head on the wall hoping it would knock me out. I bought another brand of melatonin, hopefully it works this time just like I had the previous time. I just like to vent, have you guys experience the same thing? What are your stories with your insomnia?
NotSignal	I seem to have this problem that comes up every so often where I'll be asleep or maybe right as I'm about to go into deep sleep and I have this weird dream/nightmare where I eat something too fast and choke or I was chewing on something and it got caught etc. Then I roughly wake up and think I'm dying from choking only to find out I'm fine. I've been checked for sleep apnea and I don't have it but I am heavy and wondering if maybe it's me losing air in the night. Any ideas on what it could be?
NotSignal	It happens all the time. I'd gave a good sleep pattern for months and be able to sleep easily but as soon as I have one night of insufficient or no sleep I suddenly loose the ability to.
NotSignal	I posted this as a comment on someone's post about 30mins ago. I learned this while in a Canadian mental ward for personal reasons. Hopefully this will help.Invasive Thoughts: Those uncontrolled thoughts are a part of your brain that is hard to control. They are not you. Your Brain will go off on tangents to keep you worried enough to see a problem or bring a what if problem to you, or remind you of past trauma. These are the natural responses to them by nature. You are in charge of things you create and think of. Not stuff that pops up. Separate you and your those pop up thoughts when it not good for you. Imagine it to be a condescending asshole who thinks its okay to hurt you and shove it in your face. Tell it to go somewhere else.Worrying about the future:Try to be rational with the Past, Present, Future. The past is unchangeable. Present matters the most. Everything is right here and right now. You have control. The Future is unpredictable. Yet Scary. But that is life. The future will become your present and you will still have control. Making amends:Bring closure to things that have happened to ease your mind. Example: You hurt someone's feelings and now you feel like a dick even though it was years ago? Message them and apologize for that act, don't need to be friends with them. Get is off your chest. Counseling: Counseling with CBT structures are a great way to talk about things to rationalize them and have helpful feedback from someone else.
NotSignal	I got stupid parents and they won’t let me go to the doctor for help I’ve been awake for long periods /difficulty sleeping for weeks I need something to help (don’t say melatonin I will be sad) pls help me
NotSignal	So, I'm not an insomniac at all (12 hours of sleep from Tuesday to Wednesday) but I got 0 sleep this night.Every time I dozed off some minor thing would wake me up - things like the sound of a car or my cat running. It was incredibly frustrating and the only drug I had in hands that could possibly help was diphenhydramine and I didn't feel like taking that garbage at all.Why the heck did this happen? And the weird thing is that I don't feel like crap at all. I took some Phenibut and actually feel pretty damn good. I wonder if going to the gym is a good idea on such a scenario.
Signal	Does any of you have ever tried to take Time Release Melatonin Formula to stay asleep?My problem is that I wake up 3-5 times per night.It's weird huh?
NotSignal	Im usually up for 2-4 days at a time before crashing (with the help of drugs sadly) but my longest time was a whole week. Its scary. Im not the only one right? Its been this way for nearly a year
Signal	Hi everyone! First of all, right off the bat I just want to say I’m not a doctor and obviously speak with your doctor before trying this.I posted in here a while back after going through a particularly bad sleepless cycle. I went 4 months with sleeping typically 1-5 hours a WEEK, and I was absolutely miserable and thought I in all seriousness was going to die. I was prescribed a whole slew of medications, none of which worked for me. I tried CBTI, which is helping for sure and I recommend it if you haven’t tried that yet. ANYWAYS, I was running low on my Xanax prescription and only had half a dose I typically take one night. I tossed and turned as usual, getting infuriated, you know the deal. I got out of bed defeated several hours later and dig through my pile of prescriptions and popped a restoril. I SLEPT LIKE A BABY. Neither drug worked on their own, Xanax is good for anxiety but bad for sleep, and restoril is good for sleep but bad at reducing night time anxiety. For the last 5 nights I have since taken a HALF dose of each respective medications and have entered a glorious deep sleep dreaming the entire time every night.This combination of these medications (and using CBTI) has seriously improved my sleep quality, mood, and most importantly my confidence in my ability to get myself back on track. I’m so very excited about it. Mixing these medications is obviously dangerous because they’re both the same class of drugs, which is why Ive been taking a half dose of each to counterbalance that effect. SPEAK TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. I don’t want to be responsible for anyone dying from some overdose or rare interaction. I just thought I would share because it has worked wonders for me and I know there’s potential for it to help anyone else out there who was in as bad of a position I was in (or worse, some of you crazy mfs DMd me saying you’ve spent years in the cycle I was in) Happy dreaming!
Signal	i have severe insomnia, issues with falling asleep at all sometimes, and other nights/days i’ll fall asleep for 3 hours, wake up uncomfortable and that’ll be it. it gets really lonely at dumb times in the morning, i often wake up at 5/6am and now this quarantine is happening and nobody is at school and they’re all lying in i’m going insane because i have nobody to talk to for hours. list of things i’ve tried:benadryl night nursepromethazine alonemelatonin in pretty much every dosesleepy teaseroquel (works for about a week until i have to up the dose but now i’m on a dose i have to stick to for other mental health issues so that’s a nvm)valerian root extractmixtures of a lot of these thingscutting out caffeine (doesnt work just makes days harder and makes me want a nap so instead of sleeping 3-6am i sleep 2-4pm, never good)no phone before bed (my mum has given up when she realised it didn’t help and i just got bored)reading when i can’t sleep (i end up getting sucked into the book and can’t put it down, and when i do i still can’t sleep) various breathing exercises the one thing i’ve found that actually does make me sleep, and make me sleep well, are benzos. valium is a saviour when it comes to insomnia. unfortunately i can’t be prescribed them, they’re seriously addictive, rebound insomnia, and even worse i have no way of getting them right now because all my plugs have flaked, and i’m stuck on corona quarantine. plus i really can’t afford it. i’ve spent so much money on benzos now it makes me sad why should i have to pay just to maybe sleep when i have no income and it just comes to other people?it really feels like seroquel was my last hope but obviously it isn’t working. my prescriber says there’s nothing else they can do as i suffer from bipolar and antidepressants made me more manic, which whether a side effect of the med is drowsiness or not, does not help. i’m just wondering what else in the world i could possibly try. am i just one of those people that needs benzos just to catch some zs for the rest of my life?
Signal	Hey guys I started sleep restriction with a 6 hour window. I am only sleeping 4.5 hours a night. With an all nighter of no sleep once a week. I have religiously followed the window. It’s been a week now and last night I was so tired. I couldn’t sit down because I would instantly fall asleep sitting up. I micro slept all day Any time I stopped moving my brain would switch over to sleep. So all day I powered through and didn’t sit down. My sleep window was approaching last night and being this tired , literally head falling down and switching to dream land while standing, I went to bed half an hour early. I thought “well here comes the crash everyone’s talking about finally.” And I fell asleep but woke up half an hour later wide awake. I felt like I power napped. I got out of bed and back into bed several times trying stimulus control. I felt pretty relaxed. But as the night went on I became more awake. I feel shattered. At 2 am I took a benzo and slept till 5. And now I feel tired and guilty. How can I be this tired and still not sleep during my window? Is this common? I couldn’t bare the thought of going another night without sleep guys. I just need some hope and direction. Please !! I just can’t believe I can be that tired and then my brain switches over and I lay alert the entire night. It’s mind blowing. What did the crash feel like where you finally slept through your window?
Signal	I’ve suffered from chronic insomnia and anxiety since HS. When I went to Uni, I stopped sleeping, eating and my anxiety manifested into a debilitating mess. Everyone I see I catastrophize, fear for my life that a tragedy will happen. In college, I would not sleep for up to 4 days and just stay in my single room hiding afraid of crowds. I ended up going to the student health psychiatrist, leaving at 7 am to avoid the crowd and wait for hours until I meet him. He put me on so many different drugs for anxiety and insomnia, from anti-psychotics to ssri’s.Nothing worked, I dropped out, I couldn’t take it, came to the conclusion that uni was the reason. Well it wasn’t, I’m back home and I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to sleep. I’ve been dealing with night terrors and sleep paralysis. Sleeping is a scary experience. I was put in inpatient for eating disorder I didn’t sleep for a week, they would check on me every 10 minutes with a flashlight. Nothing has worked, medicine, the therapies from inpatient and out. I’ve even tried all the holistic remedies. It’s 3 where I am and have already given up, I haven’t slept in 2 days and I’m most likely going to not sleep tomorrow either.Am I missing anything? Is there anything else I can try? I’m pretty desperate because I feel like shit all the time.
Signal	What does chronic insomnia do to our bodies? I’ve had insomnia for a month now, I believe it’s because we have absolutely nothing to do because of quarantine.
Signal	Its the only method that has worked in curing my insomnia. I compensate for it the next day by sleeping for 12 hours. On normal days, after i manage to fall asleep i only last for 5-6 hours.
Signal	I’ve been dealing with insomnia for years now and it has only gotten worse recently. I was prescribed 50mg trazodone to help fall and stay asleep. Only thing is that I’m concerned about the side effects but hopefully they won’t be so bad. Oh well, here goes nothing.
NotSignal	Mods, please remove if this type of post isn’t allowed. I grew up with a lot of trauma and anxiety, which in turn made me develop a speech impediment and pretty bad insomnia. One of the ways that helped me steer my mind away from those thoughts is either playing games or watching people play games.I’m currently hosting a steam where all you hear is subtle background noises of rain, thunder, RuneScape woodcutting and the subtle sounds of my keyboard as I respond to viewers.I have a speech impediment so I don’t talk on stream.As I still depend on having something playing in the background as I fall asleep, I thought I may as well share this since it may help someone else out there too. Thanks for reading guys. Stay home and stay safehttps://www.twitch.tv/0shaaa
NotSignal	Title says all! I need someone to help me understand if it’s heart palpitations and how to reduce it as it’s scaring me a bitAge-20Male5’11151 poundsNo underlying health conditionsIm a health guy who exercises here and thereAs of yesterday, I’ve been getting fast heart beats with hard bumps that starts a 4 am in the night and continues onwards until i sleep(Didnt sleep till 7:30 or 8 am). It honestly keeps me up at night as i try my best to not focus on it and eventually i feel a hard beat from my chest which wakes me up and keeps me up. I believe this happened to me before when i use to think i had sleep apnea but the feeling went away in a week and i slept normal again. I tend to eat a snack but didnt do so yesterday. Only ate 2 pieces of chocolate cake 2:10 am or so and then took a pill of vitamin B at 3 am today (didn’t take one yesterday).Heart palpitations happened again around 4 am and kept me up (still as im writing this). Im trying to sleep and it wont let me which im a little bit scared something will happen to meMy questions are:Is this heart palpitations?What can i do to reduce it? If im in the middle of one, what can i do so it can slowly go away?Thank you for reading! I hope to get a response so i can learn more about what i have
NotSignal	I am currently 19 and I have been waking up consistently once at different times of the night, ever night, and going back to sleep immediately after. This happened after I pulled an all nighter a few days ago. Is this something to be concerned about?
NotSignal	I just realized Trazadone is an anti-depressant but used for sleep at low doses. Does anyone take it as a PRN?
NotSignal	I have been taking escitalopram for a few months for depression and it’s quite effective. My doctor has also prescribed me 10 mg amitriptyline for PTSD nightmares that wake me in the middle of the night and prevent me from sleeping. I had my first dose last night and slept through the night! No nightmares for the first time in almost a year. I’m just wondering if it will continue to be this effective or is it likely that my body will get used to it?
Signal	How does it work for most people? After I told my psych about my insomnia cause of panic attacks and anxeity causing insomnia and insomnia in general I was told the only options where anxiety meds which would take a long time to work and wouldn't help with the actual insomnia, and Trazodone. Will my dick explode? What are your guys experiences with it? What happens if it doesn't work? I have also tried everything else like not being on my computer for a few hours before I sleep, every otc sleep medicine, and even making my room freezing.
NotSignal	Hi y'all. It's currently almost 9 am and I (19, M) haven't been able to sleep since yesterday. I'm exhausted and starting to get really stressed/anxious over this. I tried going to bed at midnight (as I usually do) but noticed I kept waking up as soon as I started to dream. After 30 minutes of tossing and turning I decided to give in and go do something. Maybe that will make me tired. No big deal. Come back to try and sleep but I just couldn't. Legs, my arm, and even my face at one point would just twitch/jerk and wake me from my dreams. I'm so tired but no matter how hard I try, I always get woken up by some part of my body twitching or jerking. I've had this before in the past but never this bad. Any advice would be appreciated, I'm really freaked out and scared I won't be able to sleep again
Signal	I have entirely forgotten how to sleep. No matter how tired I am, no matter what time of day, I can’t sleep. And I don’t mean like some of the people on here who complain about getting “only 5 hours.” Most nights I get MAYBE an hour of sleep and only after taking a handful of pills. On a good night I get two, bad nights I don’t sleep a single second. It’s severely impacting my ability to function and I’m becoming increasingly worried for both my mental and physical health. I’m genuinely worried I might die if this continues be it from natural causes or taking my own life. I’ve been experiencing chest pains, numbness and palpitations. I’m worried my body can’t take the stress. I’ve seen a slew of doctors who have done nothing but listen to me for 2 seconds and then prescribe me countless pills none of which have worked. I don’t know what else to do. I’m seeing a CBTI doctor I’m the morning. If this doesn’t work, I’m going to be genuinely terrified. I can’t do this much longer. If anyone else has been at this point and gotten past it, I would love to hear your success story.
NotSignal	Its hard for me to sleep nowadays since I started working out for the first time in my life and Im about to be an adult so its new to me. For the past 3-4 weeks I’ve been getting only 4-5 hours of sleep due to insomnia. I just lay there in bed tossing and turning and having deep thoughts about sleeping and it just gets worse. I hate it and I wish I could sleep normally again. Just yesterday I stayed up for 42 hours and only slept for 6 hours and had some Insomnia. I do not know what is causing this and some help would be appreciated.
NotSignal	Ive been yawning but tonight my eyes dont seem to get sleepy aswell as my head. Its 4am now. I have a documentary playing in the background which always help me sleep in. Does anyone have a good suggestion? I dont want my day to be messed up because i cant sleep
Signal	I’ve tried multiple insomnia medications to no avail. I’ve been so exhausted and sometime I just feel suicidal. It’s worsened my depression and I’m always on edge. I really just wish I could find something good that works. Sometimes I’m awake for days at a time until I’m so exhausted I pass out. There was one time where I was up for 3 days and passed out while walking. I just need some kind of relief so I can finally sleep well. People can die from being awake for too long and I’m really scared.
Signal	The first time I had a sleepless night was on July. It happened once, just no sleep at all, and then again two days later. Since then insomnia has tormented me at least one time every ten days. I felt very bad, but it was manageable. So in September I started a psychotherapy and I adopted a better sleep hygiene. Despite a good lifestyle (exercise, diet, regular bedtime) and therapy, everything has gone wrong anyway. Since the beginning of 2020 I am living in a nightmare, with common sleepless night and very rare decent night (and I am not talking about 8h sleep night, something I probably never experienced). Insomnia has fucked my whole life: I can no longer study properly, see any gain in muscles, even read a book with a normal focus. My mind was everything for me and now I feel like my brain is burnt. And what is making me crazy is that I predicted that I was burning out but everybody understimated, as my parents and my therapist. Sleep pills (brotizolam) don't work very well, since they do nothing when I am really nervous and when they work, in the morning,I feel like a train passed me by. I should change therapist and meet a neurologist, but I never had so little motivation and I am afraid that brain damage due to sleep deprivation could be permanent. Sometimes I fantasizes about death as the only possibile rest, but my loved ones distract me from that. Anyway, I'm very grateful to this community to exist, so I know I'm not alone.
Signal	I'm a recent insomniac. First it started with sleeping late at night then it upgraded to 2days 1night sleep straight for half a month now it has advanced to 3days 1 nights sleep . Sleeping pills like benzos , hell even ambien won't help even in high doses. 1).How do you deal with drug resistant insomnia?One interesting thing I've noticed is that in my condition is that , in the beginning of the problem , just by not sleeping 1 night , i would start hallucinating , getting delerious and agitated but as i went through more and more insomniac nights ,and i started developing habit of only sleeping 1 night in 2 days , i would be fine the 2nd day , there won't be any tripping or hallucinations , i feel sane , even as I'm staying awake 3 days in once.2).Is it possible to build tolerance to lack of sleep. If so , is that what's my brain is doing? 3). Can it mess up my brain's comprehension and memory in the long run?
NotSignal	When I close my eyes it feels like I am spinning. I get jolts even though I'm just closing my eyes and I dont even jerk it's just in my mind which feels like I jerked
NotSignal	Preferably an active noise cancelling one that's comfortable to sleep in
Signal	Ok so i suffer from paradoxical insomnia, a situation where I feel that I had of little or no sleep over long periods of time without the level of impairment expected with such a level of sleep deprivation, and often describe heightened awareness of their surroundings when lying down to sleep. So to me its kind of a psychological thing and it sucks not knowing whether you have slept. I have come out wth a theory if I "wake up" with a morning wood it means I have slept and if not, I haven't. Ia this accurate?
Signal	I have a bad brain all around, but something I really struggle with is sleep maintenance. I can fall asleep fine, but I can't *stay* asleep. I went to bed at 11 and woke up at 2. And... that was it. I tried meditating, I stretched a bit. Not in a terrible headspace, just couldn't get back to sleep.I have noticed that I get really hyper around 3am. Seems to be when my mood swings up and then I can't settle back down.Then of course I'm irritable and depressed all day because I only got 4 hours of sleep.I'm on a mood stabilizer at the moment, but it doesn't help with sleep, nor is it particularly stabilizing me at 3am, though it works ok during the day.Tried melatonin, it only works for a day or two. I exercise a lot, eat healthy-ish, yada yada. Nothing works.I tried Trazodone for a bit, but it turned out I was allergic (not being able to either stay awake or breathe is very scary).Has anyone found any success with this problem? I feel like this is part of my cocktail of mental health issues, but while I can live and work through the rest, this is really wearing me down.
Signal	So, my insomnia, is primarily trouble falling asleep that’s my biggest challenge always. And, so, I hadn’t really slept without use of a sleep aid medication for many years now. I don’t know how / simply can’t fall asleep without taking something.I’ve been on many different non addictive meds for insomnia, usually relied on Seroquel. No longer on that. Doctor has placed me on 75mg doxepin for sleep, and it seems to be working ok-ish?But the thing is, I really dislike its side effects profile and possible health issues; mainly how it blocks acetylcholine which has to do with learning and memory, so effectively leads to dementia and cognitive decline.So I’m wondering; if there’s any sleep aids out there (non addictive cause docs won’t give addictive ones); that may help or work for putting me to sleep but, lack antichlorigenic side effects like my current one? Or any tips or tricks unrelated to meds?
NotSignal	I’ve always had problems with sleep but never thought I could have sleep apnea if I don’t snore. I always feel like death when I wake up and for hours afterwards, doesn’t matter how much sleep I get. I’ve also been told I breath really loudly when I sleep, like I’m running a marathon or something. I’ve had insomnia for years which has only gotten worse but I can sleep for 14 hours if I don’t set an alarm. Not sure if it’s related but I’ve had 10 minute conversations with people who were trying to wake me up, eyes open and everything, but then have no recollection of it when I actually wake up a few hours later.So is there anyway to test for sleep apnea at home? I don’t really want to do a sleep study since it’s like $800 with insurance
Signal	I’m a 18 year old female and i recently started having issues with my sleep. For about a week, I would get really tired and pass out at 11 pm ish and then I would wake up around 2 am. I don’t have nightmares or any dreams that I’m waking up from. I wake up with so much energy and I don’t really feel tired at all during the day but after 11, I feel really sluggish. I do have a little depression but I’m working on that and I feel like my depression is very minor after reaching out to family and friends. I am against using over the counter meds for sleeping aids because I don’t want to rely on drugs to fall asleep but if I don’t have success with regaining a normal sleeping pattern, I might purchase them. I have garlic cloves and green tea in my home and I am going to try eating them close to dinner time. Can someone recommend me some natural herbs or Ayurvedic treatments for insomnia.
NotSignal	Is it okay to usually not get tired till 10:30 and often cry myself to sleep? I dont know anymore
Signal	I have a client/friend who has terrible anxiety and insomnia. She says songs or even phrases or words get stuck in her head and she lays there tired, but unable to clear her mind and sleep. It’s affecting her life. Her health. Her weight (I’m her personal trainer and she’s always tired and withdrawn at our sessions). Her husband is a doctor and she says they’ve tried everything. Ambien is too addictive, as is Xanax. She says she has an addictive personality and afraid to try these more than once or twice. She’s tried cbd and thc, melatonin both OTC and prescribed. Makes her tired but not fall asleep. She’s got 5 kids as is Mormon. I don’t know how to help her. She’s also borderline bipolar and gets depression. The lack of sleep is affecting her ability to lose weight. I know there’s something that got to help through nutrition, meditation, etc but man, it’s so hard to watch her struggle with 50 extra pounds, and no energy. Anyone have suggestions? Weird stuff that worked for them? Supplement combinations? Books on tape? She says she’s tried everything but maybe someone can offer tips that helped them and I can pass them on.
Signal	Like, for fucks sake.I can't sleep at night, I really can't, but when the morning comes and it's time for my online classes I literally pass out, I don't even know what I'm studying anymore.I don't even know if I'm sleeping anymore? Everytime I sleep it just seems as if I'm stuck in the "drifting into sleep" mode. I never dream, I always wake up even more tired, and I always feel like I'm awake at the same time that I'm sleeping.When I fail at falling asleep, I get really cold, as if I had a fever. I've been losing weight like crazy as well, and my anxiety does not help, it just gives me heart aches and makes me tremble a lot.At this point I don't know if I'm even alive anymore, I'm so tired, not even medication helps.
Signal	How dose it make sense to be so f**king tired that it hurts to open your eyes but still not be able to sleep. F*ck you insomnia.
Signal	I am so tired. I sleep maybe 3 or 4 hours a night, then wake up with no energy. Nothing seems to work. I just want to rest
Signal	relatively new to insomnia, had an exam during the day on 3hrs of sleep. its 2.15am now and ive got 2 more exams later on. i havent gone a night with 0 sleep in a few months but i dont see myself sleeping anytime soon. feeling rly anxious, do yall hv any idea if ill be able to not screw up my papers :/
NotSignal	Im just so sick of it!! This is gonna hit me so hard in a few hours.🤦🏻‍♀️ Last week I was getting 6 hours per night ugh
NotSignal	Almost 7 years and now he says he not happy,. I feel asleep for a little now I’m wide awake 😢
Signal	It’s hard for me to sleep,and if I do sleep I can stay asleep past 2 hrs and I wake up and stay up for the rest of the night. Then when the sunrises I sleep but then I end waking up in the afternoon and energy is drained. I’ve been dealing with insomnia since I was 13 and this shit is killing me. I try to exercise to help me sleep but I just can’t stay asleep. So that’s why I am here now text at 2 am and it damn near about 3am.
Signal	Hi, im 13 and have had insomnia for atleast 2 years. Im just curious to know if its normal at my age to have insomnia?
NotSignal	Night 1: I’m like Ryan I don’t want to sleep I want to go beyond that 11 days mark. Probably won’t reach it but still try to and update I wanna experience hallucination the journey has begun.
Signal	Hi everyone. I'm typing this and thinking why so many people have this horrible insomnia... My chronic insomnia started 2 years ago. I believe it was because of my job that would start at 6am and I was afraid I wouldn't make it. I left my job 4 months ago but the struggle is continuing. I have anxiety all my life but recently I get so anxious before sleeping that I can't sleep even when I'm tired...On a weekly basis I visit a therapist who's awesome and he's really trying to help but nothing is working so far. Even if I am able to sleep I wake up at around 3 and can't go back to sleep. I suffer and suffer until my boyfriend wakes up so happily and starts having an amazing mood. And he also says he's sorry I have a bad day again. That's it. I mean I know that he's doing his best with my chronic insomnia but I can never stop being jealous of people who enjoy the sleep without even thinking about it...I took LORAZEPAM for 8 months last year. I stopped it when I realize that every 2 months I should get a bigger doze to be able to sleep. I tried pretty much everything : herbs, massages, breathing, yoga, therapy, dancing, painting. Last 2 years I've been looking for all kinds of activities that could help me with insomnia and panic attacks afterwards. I traveled a lot hoping to change the scenery but nothing is changed. When I can't sleep I get so anxious that my head spins around, I want to throw up and sometimes want to go out and scream about my pain.I heard that CBD oil can help but as I'm in a country where it's not being sold so I am afraid to order it and later have problems with the law... I swear I don't know what else to do. I have everything to enjoy my life but I can't do it because of my sleep disorder. Actually, right now I just want to hear that I'm not alone. I believe this isn't going to leave for awhile or maybe forever. Patience to all of us and have a good day or night wherever you are!
Signal	Hello all, I am quite the anxious guy especially regarding health issues. My catastrophic mind is capable of self diagnosing all kind of rare ailments and diseases. Alas, recently I've stumbled upon an article about the ridiculously rare sFI (Sporadic Fatal Insomnia) which my anxiety immediately used as fuel for my nightmares and I've been finding harder falling asleep for the past couple days because I think I have that condition. One night I've fallen asleep at 2 AM after fighting my anxiety for hours, last night I fell asleep at around 3 AM, still anxious. I have to my side that once I fall asleep i stay asleep and normally get 5/6 hours of sleep (although not at the normal schedule).Do you have any advice on how to cope with this vicious circle ? How do I convince myself that: No, I don't have such a super rare disorder just because I've fell asleep late for two days. I just can bear to spend the night rolling around in my sleep thinking of an impending doom that is most definetly not there.Thank you people for your support
NotSignal	When i close my eyes and start to dose off i get so anxious without any reason like i get so frustrated without any reason and I always feel like there is something incomplete that i have to do like drinking water adjusting my pillow going to toilet I don’t know what it is but i can’t stay in bed for too long I unconsciously developed a phobia what to do?? I have gotten three hours of sleep and head is killing me
NotSignal	Yet here I am, like so many times before, having laid In bed for hours, and I’m wide awake. It’s so crazy to me that some people are like my cat, and have zero issues with sleeping. What is that like?
Signal	Only started having sleeping issues around 6 months ago and now they happen 2-3 times a week. I work behind a bar and don't want dark circles or looking tired while serving so I try having early nights before the days I work. It seems though these are the nights I have the most trouble falling asleep. It's like Im stressing all night that if I don't sleep I'll look terrible the next day. Anytime I have something on the next day, I'm guaranteed insomnia that night. When I have insomnia Im usually up till 5-8am then can sleep for 8 hours strait, but by then the damage is already done and will still look tired. It's why I have trouble keeping eye contact during conversations. Getting pretty bad recently and honestly about to quit my bar job due to insomnia. What a joke
NotSignal	Ever since this quarantine started I've had difficulty sleeping but it seems to have gotten worse in the last couple of days. Now I'm more anxious than I've even been, my stomach feels weird and I feel like I'm totally spaced out. I'm still trying to hold myself but I feel like I'm getting lower and lower everyday and if I keep going down this path, I might not be able to get back up. Sorry if I sounded redundant but I really had to let it off my chest
Signal	A few years ago, I used to have some serious issues falling asleep — most of which I attribute to anxiety because it always happened when something bothered me. Luckily, that’s rarely happening these days.However, what is happened is that I’m waking up way too many times in the middle of the night. Typically forever I’ve woken up ~2-3 times per night, but lately it’s been more like 5-6 times per night. Usually my sleeping is in 60-90 minute increments which leads me to think I’m waking up near the end of every sleep cycle. Any advice? Thanks.
Signal	After not being able to sleep for most of the night, I finally got relaxed enough to sleep. An hour later I wake up in a cold sweat after having a vivid nightmare, and now I am too upset to even try and sleep again. There goes another night of no sleep.
NotSignal	It’s been 6 hours since I went to bed. My brain feels hot and my anxiety level is high. I don’t know what to do. My brain feels like it’s about to explode. I tried sleeping opposite sides of the bed but that didn’t work.
NotSignal	I cannot sleep until I eat immediately before going to bed. I’ll eat at 8pm and go to bed at 10pm and my stomach starts grumbling. If I ignore it and try to sleep, I’ll end up being awake till 3am and eventually can’t take it anymore and go get food. I have acid reflux, which really correlates with eating before bed, and get woken up with heart burn in middle of the night. Hope someone can relate to this struggle.
NotSignal	Although, it’s probably the celiac disease I’m likely to have because of what my GI doctor said + me being underweight, but my head fucking throbs EVERY single day and I can only get 4-6 hours of unrested sleep (which I know I should be grateful cuz some people only sleep 2-3 hours here or none at all for days) but seriously my head feels like it’s burning every single day and I can only manage that much sleep with possible microsleeps? It’s so weirdLike, my skull feels like it’s caving inAnd yes, I practice good sleep hygiene and do meditation. I’m not even anxious when I go to bed. My brain will not let me sleep for more than a few hours
Signal	Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit and it's 7am right now. I recently turned 18 during this quarantine and that along with the intense struggle of an insomniac during this quarantine (I'm sure many of your guys' conditions haven't been fairing well either sadly) which has brought the insomnia to the forefront of my thoughts I think to myself every day "How am I supposed to live a normal life like this?" which is something I'm sure many of you have thought of in the past as well regardless of suffering thru purely insomnia or a slew of other things you brain isn't doing well with, but I'm seriously stuck, I've been falling asleep anywhere from 5 to 7 every night for months now, i didn't take this semester of school but the prior one, every single day I was suffering immensely from my exhaustion to the point where I'd pass out in class (I go to school for music so it's not exactly like it's because the lecture is boring me, I have passed out while carrying tubas and it's super scary). but yeah this has been my rant, I don't know what I'm supposed to do to help myself, I've tried meds, I've tried meditation, I've tried limiting my screen time before trying to go to bed, and it's especially bad being mixed w my ADHD because I can never get calm enough to sleep nor do I have the attention span to try most nights. Thank you to whoever read this whole thing, I'm just trying to get something off my chest and maybe seek some advice in the meantime.
NotSignal	Sleep has been pretty weird lately, I'm able to sleep however I've been waking up multiple times a night and now a new thing has been occuring, where in the morning I'll be woken up by things that aren't even there.For context, I've been home alone for a few weeks. The other day I was woken up by hearing three of my housemates running around the house and laughing. I was fully awake, able to text a friend that "my housemates are home now", but it was creating a huge amount of confusion as I knew they wouldn't be back yet, so I knew I couldn't trust what I was hearing. Fell asleep again until I woke up half hour later, house completely silent and from looking around, pretty clear not a soul had been there???Didn't realise this would happen more than once though fml, like today I was woken up by the sound of a housemate dragging the vacuum up the stairs, banging their door open and vacuuming their room, then mere minutes later I got a text from that exact housemate that they'd be returning home in the evening. Immediate proof they're not there, yet the noise still didn't stop for a good ten minutes until it seemed to fade off or something??&#x200B;Idek what's happening or if it's significant but just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences, bc anyone I've asked had no idea what I was on about :(
Signal	Hello guys! This is my really first reddit post ever. I just wanted to summarize a few helpful things/discoveries about my experiences. First thing. When it’s bedtime, or when you arrive at home, remind yourself that is time to PUT DOWN all the crap you have carried all day. Look at sleeping like a point of reward, that is time to do nothing, just resting/relaxing. Maybe it’s even better to think like you are going to rest now, or meditating, and don’t mention yourself sleeping at all. Ofc if you had a lot unsuccessful attempts to sleeping, it will automatically generate THAT feeling we all know very well. The onion effect. When you suffer a bad experience a lot, it builds up like an onion. So when you go to bed, can’t sleep, that experience comes again, and it comes immediately right? Good old anxiety. That is why i said to myself, I’m not going to sleep now, just relax, or take a nap. Sleeping is something that doesn’t happen on your order, we all know that. You can move your limbs on your command for example. So when it comes to sleeping don’t be that headstrong! That is why it’s called - FALLING asleep - keep this in mind. Sleeping comes normally, when you don’t want anything. ( I hardly recommend to read some books from Andrew Feldmár, that was his advice to somebody with insomnia). Accept that, if you fall asleep, you are not in charge. Accept that it's not the time to think about stuff, that is unsolvable at night, only at daytime, so stop it, totally pointless. (Also sleeping is a bit similar to death. You have to give/fall to some “void” if you like. So if you are anxious about sleeping, maybe you should consider your relationship with death. I lost too many people from my family, so i had a few meeting with Mr. Reaper. I’m not cool with death for sure.) Doing something you hate also can help you fall asleep. Pick some housework you really really hate, and start doing that. You will be yawning in a short term probably. Your body will choose sleeping instead of washing the 4 day old, alien egg - allosaurus liver grease from your plate. Getting early in bed helps me to get comfortable, because i know that i have time to calm down, and etc. When i was really down, slept 3 hours in like 4 days, I pleaded my psychiatrist that i really need some medication that puts me 100% percent to sleep. She smiled me, and than she said: “ The only medication that will lead you to a 100% successful sleep, is death.”(Thats was my first meeting with her, i loved it lol) We laughed a bit, and then i relived. I was in gollum mode to found the “ring”, the perfect pill for sleeping, but that’s not exist. What gets my comfortable, if i don’t feel loneliness. Like i can call up my girlfriend, or i can take a nap with my dog next to me. In the end guys, here are some mainstream tips you heard about 100 times but maybe some of you didn’t: don’t do any sport activities before bedtime, don’t play computer games, especially what generates you quick reactions, and a very simple meditation: close your eyes, slow breathing, and feelconcentrate how the air goes in and out from your nostril. I really hope i could at least 1 thing that might help you to get relaxed. Until then, f people who can sleep well:DxxAdam
NotSignal	Commonly, when I wake my girlfriend up and we talk for a bit, if she goes back to sleep, she forgets the conversation. She is obviously awake as she talks normally and sometimes even opens her eyes a bit. We'll have full conversations ranging from a minute or two to 10+ minutes, but she remembers nothing.I've tried to look this up, but I just get thrown in the wrong direction. I'm hoping someone here can help.
NotSignal	I take magnesium, it sort of works. Melatonin gives me a slight hangover and messes with my hormones. After doing some labs, results showed low levels of glycine. In supplementing, it’s worked wonders on getting to sleep. I suggest chatting with a doc about taking it. I started on 500mg since it’s kind of strong, I don’t think I’d want to take a higher dose, albeit higher amounts seem prevalent in supplements. Thought to put this out there.
Signal	I’ve always had issues sleeping ever since I was young but starting in December I suddenly experienced really bad insomnia to the point where now I’m consistently staying awake for 2 days at a time before eventually crashing this is 2 days with zero sleep. I’ve been to my doctor multiple times I’ve now got a long course of zopiclone as well as melatonin and I’ve followed all my sleep hygiene down to the letter along with practicing meditation and mindfulness. I can’t sleep I’m literally getting 0 hours of sleep a night I lay in bed for half an hour get up, go back to bed lay in bed again and this goes all the way from 11pm at night till the morning where I eventually just get up with no sleep. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do anymore,
Signal	I started smoking weed as a last resort 2 years ago for chronic pain, and what I got instead was a miracle. It cured my insomnia, which in turn reduced my depressive symptoms, which in turn helped me lose over 100 pounds.Fast forward 2 years and I realized I was a chronic smoker (an 8th a day) and no longer using it as a tool, so a break was absolutely called for.Unfortunately,with the weed gone, the insomnia has returned. Most sleep aids still don't work for me, so I'm left tossing and turning until 4 or 5 most nights again.Just posting to vent I guess. I hate it.
NotSignal	I know this post is long and rambly. I guess I'm just venting here. If you read this and reply, I appreciate you a lot.I hate not being able to sleep. I love sleeping. I didn't used to have sleeping problems. As a kid I remember being excited about going off to dreamland, and feeling so good waking up. As a young adult I could drink coffee at 10 at night to stay up till 3, and then go to sleep. I started having trouble around the end of college, I caught Mono and couldn't sleep for around a week, and ever since then i never sleep a full 8 hours anymore, just 7 is a really good night now. I think really it is just the pressures and worries of adulthood: the endless grind of work, bills due, rent due, health problems starting to form. I take good care of myself. I don't smoke, rarely drink, eat well, exercise, but what's the last corner of living well? Sleep. I moved to Thailand a year ago, and started a TEFL job at a decent school. It requires me to wake up before 6 AM in order to be at school on time. I have been using antihistamines to go to sleep around 10. They make me drowsy and dose off, and sleep through the night. Lately though, I sometimes wake up feeling like my brain is dirty. Like I'm sleeping but not really sleeping. So I want to break my habit from them. I usually don't take them on the weekends and sleep fine anyways. But this weekend, I've been having a really bad spell. It's Sunday morning here, and I haven't slept well since last Wednesday night. Every day I'm exhausted, and think, "tonight I should sleep well," but when it comes time for bed, I lay awake all night.I try to practice good sleep hygiene: no afternoon caffeine, exercise, no screens an hour or two before bed, just reading. I try and clear my mind, not think about anything... Doesn't seem to work. When I find I'm not dozing, I get up and read for an hour and go back to bed. All weekend instead of having fun I've just felt like shit. And now it's back to work tomorrow and I don't know if I can handle going back. I'm worried I'll start hallucinating, or just be super foggy and not able to do anything.I tried taking a melatonin, and felt a little drowsy, but it didn't seem to do anything. Anyways, I think i will speak to a doctor soon and maybe start CBT for this. I don't want to need drugs to sleep. I just want to find my rhythm, and get on with my life.
NotSignal	Don’t/can’t sleep right now so I thought I’d join this subreddit and see if anyone was awake to talk.
Signal	I donated plasma for the first time today. I’m fine but I have felt drained since. I told my mom, “I am gonna sleep good tonight. They need to let me do that everyday and my insomnia will be cured.” 😂 Figured you’d all get that sentiment.
Signal	Was wandering if gabapentin was worth a shot for me to try and help my insomnia. I’ve tried benzos and ambien and they don’t help me sleep just relax me and the ambien made me act fucking stupid and the videos were hilarious
Signal	Its 2am. I have work at 9am. I need a shower, and need time for coffee, I also walk to work, so I get to be up at 6am. I dont see myself sleeping any time soon.Little background info: I was diagnosed with insomnia as a kid, and I'm just a night owl anyway. I've learned over the years I don't need much sleep to function, 4-5 hours a night works just fine, buuuuuuutttttttt I also have depression, which sometimes means I dont sleep, or I'm finally, actually, tired, lately it's been the exhaustion.When my new boss started working at the store I told them "Hi, I have CRIPPLING insomnia and I'm a night owl due to genetics, I cant work mornings" I'd been doing happy 1pm-9pm shifts, until the beginning of February, the company changed, the opener for my department is on nights so I'm opening, its worsened the depression, I feel physically ill in the mornings, I don't know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated.
Signal	Similar to a previous post, I noticed some stuff i hadn't before. Whenever I do pull an all nighter with this insomnia my eyes dont go blood shot red? Before this insomnia my eyes would burn from lack of sleep but not anymore...... is this normal ?!?!?! And Even in the morning/ afternoon I cannot fall asleep. Last night I fell asleep because of Trazedone which has been working for me twice now but still feel really tired in the morning :(
Signal	To bed at 10, up at 1, tried to sleep again at 4:30, alarm to ring at 5:30. 4:30 dream: Couldn’t find my apartment after I just walked down the stairs. Couldn’t find my phone but somehow had an old flip phone. Went to work at some large facility on a big campus. Was outside with many families when several rolling earthquakes hit. Thought we were ok so tried to call kids but no answer. Then one family pointed out a thick black cloud coming up the hill. Peeked around the building to see the city below completely on fire. Crawled up the hill to a fountain and climbed in. Trying to text my kids on the flip phone when I woke up with heart racing and full of sweat. Had to call in to work. Cannot safely do my job today. Want to sleep again if I can but don’t want to dream.
Signal	I've posted in here a few times about my insomnia. A few weeks ago, I began smoking weed before bed to help me sleep. It worked wonders when nothing else really did. I have anxiety as well as a lot of stressors in my life right now (I'm a student, broke up a long term relationship in October, etc.), but I never had any issues with sleep up until about a month ago.My sleep has been a lot better over the past few weeks with the weed, and I have generally been feeling less stressed about the sleep issues as well as the other stressors. Last night I tried to sleep without smoking before bed. Maybe this wasn't the best choice of night to try it, because I was having an anxious day with a lot of things already on my mind (mostly about my ex), but I figured since it was Friday night and I don't have much to do today (Saturday) that it might be a good bet to at least try.I could not sleep without it. My body and mind would not rest and I ended up going out for a smoke around 1:30am. I ended up sleeping just fine after that. I know that weed is a good natural remedy, and that it is probably better for you than most OTC or prescription sleep aids, but part of me is really scared that I will never be able to sleep naturally again, or that I have some bad disease (you know the one) that is just currently being masked by smoking weed. Logically I know that this is most likely just my anxiety, but if I've had anxiety my whole life, why is it now suddenly affecting my sleep like this when it never has before? I have a neurologist appointment in about a week, and a psychiatrist appointment a few days later, but after last night I am really afraid that I will never sleep on my own again, because weed was the only thing that helped the issue in the first place, and it seems that if I did not have it I would still not be able to sleep on my own. Any thoughts?
NotSignal	As soon as I close my eye and try to sleep, it feels like I float out of my body and it scares the shit out out of me and this repeats over and over and over and over!!! IT'S MADDENING. I just want to fucking sleep!
NotSignal	For nearly 2 months i can't sleep before sunrise. I don't know why but i feel really anxious and depressed when i try to sleep at nights. I feel like I'm about to cry. After sunrise i feel relaxed and calm but nights are terrible. I want to fix that what should I do. Theres no problem for now because schools are closed but there will be when they re opened.I had so much problems this year. I had some health issues in last October it wasn't a serious health problem but I was so anxious about it. It was bad but after short time I was mentally healthy again. Then i questioned my religious beliefs, but it was not easy i was so stressed and anxious. I was scared of hell. And i couldn't tell anyone about it. It took long time for me to calm down again but i did. But at least i was going to school, meet with my friends back then. I feel so lonely now.I'm 16 and I will be 17, 3 days later. This was the worst year I've ever experienced. Even if there wasn't a pandemic it would still be my worst year but pandemic makes it worse. And i am afraid to go to the hospital. My mother has multiple sclerosis, she is healthy but it is risky for her to get Coronavirus.
NotSignal	This is something that I have noticed about myself for a long time. I can’t sleep because I don’t know what to dream about. Every day I go to bed with the same fantasy in my head and then I cant sleep. I don’t even end up dreaming about that but i get these weird dreams instead that make no sense and when I wake up I wonder how my mind was even able to come up with this stuff.. Its like I forgot what I am supposed to be doing while in bed. Not sure if this is insomnia or some other issue. Anyways its 4:38am
Signal	Ok but really. I mean my matress isn't cheap, it ain't foam, but I just want to drive a knife into it as to let the air out if it but it doesn't work like that. If I take the meds my doc gave me they don't work cus they're a fucking anxiety medication and I guess that's just a cure all. I can't take more than 6mg of meletonin or it doesn't work. It doesn't matter if I sleep on the couch or a made/unmade bed, it doesn't work. Help? Idk man my sleep schedule is fucked. My body's just uncomfortable with lying in one position and I don't want to sleep cus it's day time and I won't sleep later but what's the point the sleep cycle will just be ruined in two days god it never ends
NotSignal	Hey.. I'm kinda new to this so I am really sorry if I don't belong here, if I don't I'll leave but I just need some help..I keep waking up in the middle of the night and no matter how hard I try (meditation, breathing exercises...) I can't fall back to sleep, also every time I try my head is filled with really dark thoughts so it makes it harder to try.Tge thing is that I'm not sure if it has anything to do with my antidepressants that I take or not but either way I just need some advice Thank you so much
NotSignal	Since the virus started I smoked what most would consider a very excessive amount of pot up until about a week ago when I realized my tolerance was through the roof. Ever since, I find it incredibly difficult to fall asleep at night. Anyone else? Any tips would be appreciated.
Signal	Hello all,I’ll preface with saying my insomnia is due to poor life habits (poor planning so have to be up late doing deadlines, staying up too late with friends etc).I went through an extremely stressful period the last 12 months and most things have resolved but throughout it I acquired a large sleep debt from insonsistency.At first it wasn’t too bad, some nights here and there. But I used to get 9 hours of sleep a night and now average 6-7. Then the last two months I average 5, some days more some less. I never let my body fully recover and have just started a plan to, but I feel like I’m permanently damaged. My memory is shot, I forget things I was doing and remember the most random things. I still have a long term memory (though scattered). However my concerning symptom is when it’s later like 9:30pm/10, I start feeling weird headaches straying awake. I can’t focus on reading or watching Videos or gaming, which is good bc I have just recently cut them out late and strict with sleep.But I worry because I feel new headaches I haven’t had before and get a sense of detealization. These headaches only come when watching something late when I’m tired: it’s like my brain is too tired to process it and it hurts trying to. But rest and not doing it makes it go away.I constantly feel tired as well. It’s like my brain is overtaxed and is functioning at 60% capacity, I used to be able to do schoolwork throughout the day and what not but I have been drained. These last two weeks killed me with some nights sleeping 8 hours some only getting 3. I’m on a plan to fix it and everything is going well on that end (just started recently though).I want to ask can you have significant permanent brain damage from inconsistent sleep that grew worse over a period of months, or can the majority of it (or all) be restored with long term good sleep habits?I have OCD and worry that I won’t be able to recover and will be stuck in a state where I can not focus or mentally function, but I think that’s just anxiety. I often now can’t focus on a task and am zonked out, reality feels like a dream often (I’m not crazy and I know it’s reality, it’s like my brain is functioning in low power mode to protect itself).
Signal	This post is to hopefully help some people and also get guidance if someone is in my shoes. I’ve had insomnia for as long as I can remember. The average time it would take me to fall asleep was usually 2 hours. Some nights it’d be me laying down in a completely dark soundless room tossing and turning until it’s 1-2 hours till I had to be up for work. I could take 4-6 Benadryl, melatonin, Valerian root etc.. with no effect. Always did what I should be doing with regards to limiting caffeine after noon and trying to go to bed at the same time every night. Always in a dark soundless room. I ended up being prescribed trazodone and it worked great for my sleep and has been for a few years now. So for someone struggling I would highly recommend that to start. Now for my issue. Trazodone is a low level SSRI that they pretty much found out works great for a sleeping pill on accident. But being that it’s an ssri, I have been feeling a bit of the “numbness” mood wise that I’ve heard many people describe after having anti depressants of that kind. Sort of zombie like state. Not really happy not really sad. Though I do also struggle with depression. My depression could be just from an actual imbalance like most people, but I think it could potentially be from the “zombie” effects of the trazodone. If that’s happening at all. Does anyone else have this problem? Does anyone else taking trazodone not on any other anti depressants experience this? And if so did you switch sleeping pills? Thanks
NotSignal	I mean it's also awful! But being that Im the only person I know in real life that has chronic insomnia it's good to read that other people struggle equally. I've also come down with a cold and a mega blocked nose along with it, so there is no chance I'm sleeping tonight.
Signal	HiI (32F) feel extremely anxious and can't sleep. After a massive anxiety attack and being diagnosed with pure ocd I started having these internal tremors. They started out at night when I lay in bed in my legs, but now I can feel them in my chest and sometimes face. They aren't constant, only active at rest, but there extremely scary. Not helping the anxiety at all. I started having lots of muscle twitches.My GP thinks it's the anxiety, but did refer me neurologist. My appointment isn't until Dec. 1st. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, but maybe a little reassurance that someone else has had these? Did they eventually go any? Did anything help? I haven't gotten a full night's sleep in a month, and I'm exhausted. I went on Dr. Google and Jesus was that a mistake.
Signal	It isnt that I dont want to sleep. I used to blame my lack of sleep on years of conditioning due to working shift work, going to college, and family stuff. There just wasn't time to sleep, so I stopped. But all of that is gone, and I still sleep less than 5 hours a night. And never straight through. Now it is this anxiety that I will miss something BECAUSE I am sleeping. It could be any number of things that I miss; kid needs something, cat is locked outside (I checked on him twice, he is sleeping on the couch), missed text, missed work call, did I forget to turn something off. Then when I wake up, I have this panic of trying to remember if something happened that I forgot about or slept through. It is easier to just not sleep. For the past week it is worse than normal, I am getting 2-3 hours of sleep. I try to go to bed earlier, but I just wake up at a weird hour. And then the math of when I have to get up, compared to the time now, and if I were to fall asleep instantaneously, how much time would I get. Can I function on that? Well that number is now T-minus the old number, how does that change the math?.... I am exhausted just trying to think through my thought process.
Signal	Ever since grade school I've been an early waker/late sleeper. Over the last two years, however, the problem has gotten increasingly severe- I believe it's been because of my long time with depression: Countless days with sleep directly after work/school- I'd simply drop dead after 'a long day'. Right now most nights I wont fall asleep at all. I might go to bed 22:30 (10:30pm for u ameriphones), but just lie there being close to dozing off but then just be wide awake at a whim. I believe it's been affecting my cognition. When I go to my doctor's about it, he recommends taking some baldrian supplements, which I do- herbal shit, doesn't work. On the package it says MAX 4 pills daily, I take 4 before sleep accompanied by 5 of my beta-blockers for anxiety. I figured the angst from not being able to sleep might get suppressed.I lie there, what time is it? Now 1am- lie there a little more- leg itch, time? 2:30am- close my eyes try to strain my brain by creating complex or difficult images: radiator noise, time? 3:20am, almost time for work....What the fuck do I do. It's been a few years like this. I feel retarded for the lack of a better word compared to myself just a year ago. My cognition has dramatically decreased. So has my selfesteem. I grow increasingly paranoid. But my therapists and doctors have been for naught
NotSignal	I have to get up for work in 5 hours and I cannot sleep. I'm going insane. I don't know what to do at this point. I can't even bring myself to type anymore.
NotSignal	My doctor just prescribed it to me. I haven't slept in 48 hours, so I'm a little desperate here. I don't plan on taking it often thoughAlso:1. Should I nap this afternoon or just wait for tonight?2. Can you take CBD with it?
Signal	Tonight was particularly rough, I might not be able to tell you specifically how many hours I had after the initial two or so, because for me it felt like I was resting my head on the pillow the entire night.I followed my nightly routine of shutting off my computers and TV's one hour before bed. Sometimes I'll take a shower too. I blocked the light coming in from under my door, My curtain doesn't do a particularly good job of blocking out the lights that were turned on from the other buildings across from my window, which I was able to see through the mirror, and I tried to block it with some wood I had lying around. My room isn't really pitch black during the night, but I generally try to go to sleep about 30 minutes or so after the sun goes down. Even before I was waking up in the middle of the night, my circadian rhythm shifted to wake me up an hour earlier at 5AM instead, so I moved my bedtime an hour back to compensate. (I would love to move my wake up time back to 6AM if possible.) Anyway, I went to sleep last night at around 9PM or so, and I never really have trouble falling asleep the first time I hop into bed for that night. However, as of recently, I've been waking up 2 hours or so after going to bed, and finding it really hard to fall back asleep after that. Even though I still feel extremely tired, even though I still feel drowsy and like I want to close my eyes and fall asleep... The moment I put my head back on the pillow or a few moments after I just feel like I'm fighting a futile fight, or like I'm metaphorically repeatedly smashing my head against a brick wall, or a pillow, in this case. I know I'm tired, I know I need and want to sleep, but for some reason my body isn't cooperating after that initial sleep wake up. I've also been using a sleep tracker app to track my actual sleep duration and I've been finding that, mostly, my efforts of leaning my head on the pillow waiting to fall asleep has been gifting me small moments of sleepiness after that initial wakeup, but even then, it's usually only an hour or so more followed by another wake up and another session of trying to fall asleep on the pillow. And, once again, a short time after the sun comes up I can kiss any hopes of getting any additional sleep goodbye. This has been happening to me for the past 3 days, but this was probably the most rough night of them all. After waking up at around 10:30PM, I proceeded to take two of the Melatonin gummies that I had left over from the last time I had to use them in an attempt to hopefully get the system going again. I didn't need them the first time I hopped into the bed that night because I fell asleep fine without them, so I was hoping that taking them after the first wake up would help provoke my brain to lull me back into sleep mode, but even with the gummies it didn't really do anything for me. I know I said I used a sleep tracker app, but I've been trying to avoid it because again, it's part of my routine to avoid screens an hour before my bedtime so that my sleep is not interrupted by it. However, I am not sure if it'd be okay to just turn the app on really quick before sleeping and minimize the time I spend looking at the app to start the sleep tracking. (like less than 20 seconds or so probably) I don't know if this matter's much, but my desktop computer is actually situated in my room next to my bed. However, I do not lay on the bed while using it, I sit strictly in a chair when I use it. I have considered moving the computer to another room if I need to, but my bedroom is the only room in the house that's really mine, so I'm not sure where else I could put it. Still, that computer has never caused me any sleep problems before even back when my sleep schedule was around 10PM to 6AM back during early 2019. I had none of these sleep issues back then, and my lifestyle now is roughly the same as it was back then. It's really frustrating not being able to get the sleep that I need, and feeling all tired and drowsy during the day only to go back to sleep the next night thinking everything is going to be fine and then just... dealing with the same thing again... sometimes a bit better, and sometimes worse, like the night I just woke up from. I've also considered going to a sleep clinic for testing but I heard that some of those can cost up to 5000$ USD and I don't even have that kind of money. I really want to get the sleep that I need and it is really frustrating that nothing is working out for me, even though everything was generally fine before. This sleep problem has been affecting me since somewhat around the last couple of months of 2019, on and off, sometimes I wouldn't wake up a single time and other times I'd go consecutive days waking up either 2 or 3am in the best case scenario and 2 or so hours after I initially go to bed in the worst case scenario, like last night. It's been consecutive as far as I can tell except for the one night where I turned off the computer screens one hour before bed, and then took a shower before laying in my room (this was around the time the sun was going down, so there was still some sunlight) with no screens and I listened to some music for 30 minutes or so until the alarm I had set for 9PM went off, then I went to sleep, and I don't think I woke up once during that night. At least, not to the point where I was physically awake and laying my head on the pillow trying to get back to sleep. The next thing I am going to try is a sleeping mask for my face and some earplugs, because real recently there have been some really loud birds that like to make noises outside my bedroom window at around midnight. I've been dealing with a lot of things recently, but I feel like this might be the worst of it. I'm really worried about what will happen if this sleep thing persists for the rest of my life, what prolonged sleep deprivation will do to me, despite me wanting and trying to get the right amount for my age? If you read this entire wall of text, thank you. I really want to get my sleep back in order, and it seems like I'll need some help doing it. Thanks to everyone in advance!
Signal	Last night I started experiencing extreme fatigue ~1 hour after going to bed. I would close my eyes for JUST 1 minute, and when trying to open them, it was hard and my vision was mostly black. I also could hardly move my hands. I felt like I was going to pass out. Then I got up and my heart started racing like crazy and I got somewhat anxious. This bothered me so much I couldn't sleep. It felt like I was losing my vision and my ability to move.I ended up taking a Ritalin 5mg to combat the extreme fatigue (which worked), and an Ativan since the Ritalin suppresses all feelings of sleepiness. Has this ever happened to any of you guys?
NotSignal	Hi. How’s it going?Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow is a new adventure!Tonight’s special is ‘Left over Chinese food’!The microwave is over there. I’m listening to The Cure ‘The Head On The Door’.
Signal	Pretty much what the title says. Just trying to find success stories. My wife has chronic insomnia and she’s so discouraged that she hasn’t found people who overcame their chronic insomnia without needing to take sleeping meds for life.
NotSignal	It’s currently 5 in the morning here it’s been another night without sleep. I feel like the worst human ever for letting my sleeping problems control meI had to cancel plans with friends I haven’t seen in a very long time due to distance and different schedules. And obviously they aren’t my best friends as I don’t see them this often, but I really feel like a bar person be I have to drive 4 hours to see them and I don’t want to fall asleep at the wheel.Did I make the right choice?
NotSignal	I do not want to give up drugs. I’m being forced. Clonaz I do because it’s just a way to skyrocket tolerance but I’m being watched 24/7 and told I can’t do any drugs. I can’t even sleep because that bugs me out. It’s my life and my body. I have insomnia as is I should be able to take whatever to sleep
Signal	So I might have developed insomnia but am not sure. for the last couple months or so I havent had a fulfilling sleep. my sleep schedule is messed up, most days when I go to sleep I seem to wake up an hour later. then wake up again 2-3 hours after that, unable to go to sleep because of this “tired from sleeping” feeling (if that makes sense). By the way I constantly have that 10 minutes before bedtime groggy and feel extremely irritable throughout the day after waking up, still unable to sleep and end up staying up way past my actual bedtime. this happens a couple of days at a time.then when I finally have a successful sleep, still with wake-ups at least a couple times a night but with going back to sleep, I always oversleep but have a similar daytime feeling to the days which I was unable to sleep.then the whole process repeats after 3 days.does this sound like insomnia? if so how can I fix it?
Signal	I’m getting prescribed 1mg of lunesta and I was wondering if anyone has had any feedback about it. I’ve tried trazadone, doxepin, vistiril, klonopin, temazepam, ambien and a couple more but to no avail. The ambien just made me really high and I know that lunesta is in the same drug class so I dont really want this to happen again. Any feedback would be helpful.
Signal	When I was younger I was on trazodone but that soon stopped working. Once I turned 18 I got put on clonazepam. I got hospitalized and the doctor there wouldn’t go up on my clonazepam even though I’ve been on it for 6 months and it doesn’t work. They instead put me back on trazodone but that’s not working anymore again. I’ve already on seroquel and hydroxyzine. I just do not know what to do like I don’t want my doctor to go up on the clonazepam because I’ll just gain a tolerance but on the other hand I just want one good night of sleep. What sleeping aids/tips have you found to work best for you.
Signal	This used to be heaven for me. I could sleep 12 hours. I am 19 now. I was first prescribed Klonopin for panic attacks around 12. Problem is, it doesn’t do anything. And... bigger bodies require bigger doses but I refuse to up my dose so I’m constantly in W/D. I recently upped my melatonin dose from 300 mcg to 500 mcg... I wonder if that’s why I’m waking up so early? I’m waking up at 6 AM when I need to wake up later in the day for medical reasons (I have a different pill that has to be taken later in the day and I can’t eat until I take it)
NotSignal	So like normally I sleep 8 hours all the time but tonight it’s really hard I have a big up coming event. Last time this happened I got hospitalized and I’m really worried!
NotSignal	I already feel it and it's not feeling good. This makes sleep so difficult but relieves anxiety...until it wears off. Sigh.
NotSignal	I turn the screen off as I listen to YouTube or the podcast, so no ambient light. I just need something to get my mind off stuff.
NotSignal	I've been struggling to sleep for a couple years and I managed it by using weed. My dealer moved away and I turned to alcohol instead. Its now become an unfortunate habit that I'm drinking ~3 times a week so I can pass out and also because its the only time I really feel happy. I've only had two bad hangovers in the 6+ months I've been doing this (usually just feel a bit dehydrated) but this morning I threw up blood and I'm also sick of gaining weight and losing money. So I want to stop this habit. Anyone have any advice on how to not take the easy route out when trying to get to sleep?
NotSignal	For the past week no matter how late I fell asleep I’ve been waking up at the exact same time - 5AM. I am absolutely exhausted from it and I have no idea why it’s happening. I can’t fall back to sleep.The worst part is as of yesterday I’ve been at the cottage for vacation. I was hoping that would help but here I am, up again at 5AM even after having a few beers and going to bed at midnight (now I’m tired and hungover!)I’m not sure what’s causing this to happen. I’m extremely tired, yesterday I drove for 7 hours on 4 hours of sleep. I was hoping I’d be able to get a good nights rest tonight. The only change I can think of is I started adding a lot more potassium in my diet for blood pressure reasons, but I can’t see that affecting sleep? I leave the cottage Monday and when I get back I plan on seeing a doctor. In the meantime anyone have any tips?
Signal	Hey guys I’ve been struggling so much with insomnia these couple of months, it’s currently 10am and I still haven’t slept.When I do end up sleeping I actually sleep well and a good amount of time but I take a while to fully wake up like when I’d wake up I’d still be sleepy.I would always stay up and try to restart my sleep schedule and sleepy early at night it goes well I end up sleeping and waking up early.But it never lasts more than a day it gets ruined again and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.I have tried sleeping pills basic ones, listening to sleeping aids tried sleeping techniques breathing techniques nothing works.I feel tired I feel sleepy but I can’t sleepI’d appreciate some advice
NotSignal	These hypnic jerks take me by surprise and then I'm scared to fall asleep I really don't know what to do they happen sometimes but on those nights I can't fall asleep... I also spoke to my cousin about this it happens to her but she said that she just falls right back to sleep but I can't do that it's really frustrating and if I can't sleep my head hurts all day long :(((
NotSignal	Ok so I recently read a study on people who believed they suffered from extreme insomnia (like myself). In this study the scientists found out that the patients in fact were asleep and dreaming that they were stuck awake tossing and turning all night, and this is why they would wake up believing they’ve gotten little to no sleep when they in fact have. I know for a fact I had dreams because I used to have pretty vivid ones as a child, but since I’ve moved I’ve had little to no dreams. If I did end up dreaming at all, it would be a tiny snippet that would feel either completely real, or like it already happened like a memory. The way I Dream is nothing like how other describe it and I would like to know what’s wrong with me. Whenever I was interested in lucid dreaming I read a lot of articles and I saw many mentions of reality checks. I would try to practice these but could never end up keeping up with them and my perception of time is so overlapped and fluctuating at this point that I honestly don’t know if I spend half the time dreaming or not. I have an almost perfect memory (primarily conversations because I’m a very good auditorial learner), and some thing that I know I remember happening people would swear the events never occurred. I’d appreciate any sort of help if this subject it’s honestly a lot more deeper than this it’s just extremely hard for me to articulate it and I’ve been trying to write something like this for a long time. Thanks for ya time if you did read this whole thing, I can add much more detailed information if anyone is actually interested.
Signal	When I get insomnia it happens maybe once every 2 weeks but it really sucks. Should I try taking like Tylenol pm before bed or will that make me feel worse? I’ve never taken it before so I don’t want to feel like crap AND be tired. Thanks guys
NotSignal	Guys do you know how long a pandemic lasts? I’m so fucking hie and I realized that this pandemic can last a year or a little over a year like wtf dude o think I’ll be fine if they let us walk outside but limited cause I like live in an apartment and it’s tiny and ahhh Idk
NotSignal	I havnt been able to sleep well the past 2 years but it’s gotten way worse. My normal sleep schedule is that I lay in bed awake doing nothing for at least an hour until I fall asleep at around 1 or 2am depending on the day, then I wake up around 3 or 4am and then continually wake up and fall back asleep in about 15 minute intervals. Until I finally get up at around 8:30. However, recently, about a month ago I found out that my boyfriend (who is asexual and has no interest in any sexual intimacy or pleasure, even by himself) had been looking at “Yiff” (Furry porn) images and content on reddit, including during times where I would be giving him a blow job and he would have his phone because sexual stuff like that is “boring” for him so I allowed it but always felt off about it. He also would bring his phone in the bathroom with him and I asked him about it and he promised he wasnt doing anything. Which I didn’t believe which is why I asked him not to bring it in which he was reluctant about. This was the only thing that he has lied to me about and in all other areas he is good to me and honest. I’m not going to go into all the issues about that. He has gettin rid of any signs of those images and promised to not look at it ever again and he tells me every day that he has been good and will never do anything like that again. I believe him. However I constantly have flashbacks to all the times I know he’s lied about it to me in the past and now anything animal related in the slightest gives me panic attacks. My problem is now I can’t sleep at night without waking up constantly every few minutes through the entire night and even staying up for hours in between, I get maybe 2 hours sleep but that’s accumulated through a few minutes here and there. I don’t know what to do. There are some nights where I will sleep through the whole night but those are kinda rare. Those nights are usually ones where my boyfriend has done something sexual with me. (Which he does to make me happy when he feels up to it and wants to do something like that to make us closer and more as a bonding thing.) I’m assuming I sleep on those nights because I don’t have stress that he will end up doing something else in his sleep (which I have noticed a few times happening) or in the morning while I’m not awake (even though I have been awake pretty much every morning and throughout the night and nothing happening). I don’t know how to fix this. I’m thinking of going to my on campus therapist. (I’m a college student btw, which makes not getting sleep even worse) If anyone has any advice or any coping mechanisms or tips to try or medications to possibly help them let me know. Or if I should discuss this more with my boyfriend even though we have lightly touched on the subject. I havnt gone into detail because he already feels bad about himself for this incident and he already has depression and anxiety and his main thing now that triggers it is if he has done something to upset me. So I didn’t want to set him off if at all possible. Thanks ahead of time..
NotSignal	When I go to bed and wake up my heart is racing and I don’t know why. I’m not scared of anything. In the middle of the day my heart races for no reason.
Signal	I had a crazy insomnia since I was young, and I’m being medicated. I’m recently having some nightmares and waking up around 4-ish and never able to get back to sleep. Anyone know how to get back to sleep easily? Thanks.
Signal	I’m 14 and I’ve been having sleep problems since forever but it’s starting to get unbearable. Could anyone recommend sleeping pills I can buy in the Uk? I can’t concentrate on my school work. Thanks💕
NotSignal	I fell asleep with in a few minutes of laying down last night but I couldn’t stay asleep all night because I didn’t eat dinner before bed because I had a stomach ache. I would have slept perfectly if it weren’t for that. 🙄
NotSignal	I’ve been calling in to work everyday Bc I’m so tired I can barely function, but when I lay down to sleep my body is just keeping me up. I don’t know what to do. I ship out for marine corps boot camp in two weeks and I can’t imagine if I still can’t sleep while I’m there. I won’t be able to make it. I’ve been getting drunk just to sleep but it’s barely helping. I got drunk twice today. I get drunk fall asleep for like two or three hours then wake up and can’t sleep again. I need help idk what’s happening to me. I’m scared.
Signal	Ya know I was up for three straight days last week then I finally passed out. The worst of it I actually take sleep meds. I’ve tried trazadone but it makes me not work down there.Currently trying Hydroxyzine, then I pain that with kpins, then I pair it with regular old diphenhydramine. I know these can be deadly pairs. I get that but I want fuckin sleep, and all my drs are being dicks, due to the fact my body metabolizes medicine very fast. I was told that as a young boy. I grew up in a super super Christina household it was fucked up bad. So if I broke a bone guess what I heard “god will heal you” ya he sure did months down the line when the bones would real. I baffle many drs cause my tolerance to pain/ medications. May as well just stay awake. I’m sick of this for real!!!!!
Signal	Anyone else as dependent on Melatonin as I have become?I have chronic sleep issues specifically with trouble falling asleep. When I first started working shift work (7 years ago) a colleague suggested I take Melatonin as I was struggling so badly. 7 years later it continues to be my go to every night. 60% of the time it works, the rest is of the utmost frustration. Rarely, if I am lucky to fall asleep without it it’s a cause for celebration.I’ve tried all the sleep hygiene tips and tricks-invested in a weighted blanket, meditations, cbd, and created the sleep sanctuary. Even after working a crazy shift and feeling exhausted I toss and turn wishing sleep to come. Tried Zopiclone and will still go to it if it’s really bad as I hate how it makes you feel the next day. My doctor is aware and recommends sticking with melatonin as safest option compared to other meds but I do worry about long term effects on hormones. Then again, chronic insomnia has way worse side effects mentally and physically. *my regular dose is 3mg but have had times where it was anywhere from 1-10mg.
NotSignal	My sleep cycle is screwed,(its now 4:30am)i have tablets to help with my melatonin levels but they dont really work any ideas
NotSignal	i usually never try to do this, but i am so tired of staying up all night, finally getting some sleep, and when i wake up it’s 1pm! so tonight i have stayed up the whole night. it is 5:22 AM, i’m really hoping i’ll feel tired at a normalish time!! hope i don’t give in to napping later day!
NotSignal	I‘ve been having insomnia on and off now for the last few months (never an issue before my bowel issues got worse), so I believe mine is secondary insomnia, but I’ve at least been able to get at least 5-6 hours, which my body seemed fine with. I would have issues getting to sleep sometimes because I felt rotten, and my sleep would be broken into 3 hour sections I also suffer with severe undiagnosed gastrointestinal issues. Minus blood in my stool, I have it all. Complete loss of appetite, loose stools with undigested food in them, feeling full all of the time, gas or liquids surging around my guts, can’t sleep at all when my bowels are acting like this. Even drinking water is hard, the water seems to stick around my stomach area and makes horrific noises if I push my tummy out. Burping relieves this. I believe I have GERD or gastroparesis but doctors keep trying to push anxiety on me. Sure I have anxiety, and I accept that, but literally having no appetite and struggling to eat and drink everyday is NOT a symptom of anxiety However Sunday night things took a turn and I’m very scared and concerned now. I woke up Monday morning after some broken sleep yet again and had an episode of bad Diarrhea around midday. Then my tummy has felt completely off since then and my sleep has gone to absolute shit as well as my breathing that I suspect is tied to the stomach issues, my voice is also slightly hoarse as well. Monday night I barely slept, got maybe 2 hours, just couldn’t sleep no matter how hard I tried. Kept looking at my phone, 1am, 2am, 3am, 4am, 6am, 8am, 9.30 etc etc Tuesday night was the same and I had the same Diarrhea the next morning. I went to the hospital yesterday as advised by the non emergency line. The hospital seemed more interested in making sure I wasn’t dying, did a CBC which came back fine, Kidney and liver function tests fine, inflammatory and infection markers, all clear. They gave me IV saline and my head felt a little clearer after this. They felt my tummy and said nothing sinister was wrong, but I asked if I could have an X-ray or something of discomfort around my navel and loss of appetite. They said it wasn’t necessary and once the bloods came back fine and my fluids had been given they sent me on my way I have a gastro appointment at the beginning of September but it’s a fucking telephone appointment because of Covid so nothing will even be sorted then and it will be more and more waiting for tests or they’ll pull the anxiety card out again. I had a bit of a normal bowel movement this morning which is better but still slept like shit, still no appetite and a foggy head and vision which I’m guessing is lack of sleep. I genuinely don’t think I can wait until my gastro appointment if this continues the way it is. I was at least sleeping before the end of last week, albeit broken. I feel weak and like my body is shutting down. This isn’t SFI is it? Help
NotSignal	My sleep schedule has gone completely off since quarantine started.I usually don’t miss a whole night of sleep more than once a month but recently it’s been happening every few days. More often than not I fall asleep when it’s light outside and wake up in the early evening or later.I was wondering what other people try to do when they’re trying to sleep.
NotSignal	I finally feel tired at around 4 or 5 am I wake up during my sleep and i have gained a lot of weight in 3 months. My job was really active before 8 hour shifts on my feet moving around. The weight gain is making me more anxious therefore harder for me to clear my mind I feel so stuck and with a loss of routine it is even harder. Also got a partner who snores and takes up more than half the bed.. i am smoking so much weed now that it is not good for me my brain is just all over the place I watch YouTube videos at night with a black screen and various sounds but the only peaceful nights sleep i ever get is when I am on my own in the complete silence bed to myself. I often go back to my own place which makes partner feel distant because I don't want him to come here because I just need a peaceful nights rest. Any advice on sharing this with him as he does not understand insomnia and how much it is getting to me at the moment as he always says sarcastically "i work 9 hour shifts heavy lifting 5 days a week I know what tired is" and I know he probably thinks I'm lazy because I'm not working now but I'm doing everything to keep myself busy and I have applied for every job that I can I've even taken up gardening. This virus, the job loss, the weight gain, financial issues, snoring issues and now the sleep. I am thinking about a sleeping pill prescription. When I was working I would fall asleep around 1 2 am and work 9 am until 10 PM sometimes and I think this is the main cause of my problems because I have no routine and maybe pills and a few nights on my own would help me get back into the rhythm. Thanks to anyone who reads this no hate please!
Signal	So I’ve been diagnosed with insomnia for awhile now... and about 4-5 months ago I got fed up with it and decided if I’m going to be up all night, I might as well get work done. Basically I wound up just taking my adderall around 4am on nights that I couldn’t sleep at all... about once a week. Fast forward to now, about 1/3 of my nights I barely give myself a chance to try and get some Z’s before I take my adderall. About 2-3 nights a week I don’t sleep at all because of this, and after a night or sometimes two of this in a row I’ll sleep all day and won’t be able to sleep that night. It’s a complete mess.I for some reason have grown accustomed to and don’t even mind staying up all night, and the thought of taking my trazadone to try and get some sleep is almost always passed up to take my adderall and stay up. It’s crazy to me because 6 months ago I was the complete opposite, rarely took my adderall and craved sleep, couldn’t wait to get into bed and take my trazadone. If anyone has any experience with this it would be appreciated... I’m working on it with my doctor but haven’t told him all the details about taking my adderall at night. Thanks in advance y’all.
Signal	So despite going though a rough patch of insomnia during the past two weeks, I slept relatively well today (I think). About 7 hours.But I noticed some weird things. I didn't dream or didn't recall dreaming at all, and normally I have numerous dreams per night. Also I didn't wake up very groggy as I usually do, and also I didn't wake up with a morning erection. That means I didn't wake up directly from REM sleep, which is the norm. I'm deathly scared of SFI, and I read that losing the ability to have REM is one of the symptoms, so now I'm scared, even though I don't feel very tired at all. Health Anxiety sucks.Can anyone relate to any of this? I'm scared I might only be cycling through phase 1 and 2 sleep. Can't get any tests done in the near future, so that's out of the question. I just don't want to die from SFI.
Signal	Hey yall. So I am traveling with a band for the next long while. They're playing shows most nights so getting to sleep earlier is not an option. Basically no matter what, I cant sleep past around 630 am. This has been a problem all my life. We stayed up until 3 last night and I still woke up at 630 this morning :/. Everyone else is probably going to be sleeping until 1 or 2 pm. This has been happening every night and its wearing down on me. My home state is legalized so usually I can just smoke a bowl and go back to sleep but it's not really an option now. I dont drink alcohol or use other drugs. I've been taking benadryl but it only helps me fall asleep, not stay asleep. I still wake up every few hours and then cant sleep past 630. Anyone have any tips for being able to sleep in or go back to sleep after waking up? I always wake up with a burst of energy/ anxiety at 630 and going back to sleep seems impossible but I've gotta do something about this because this is not sustainable. I guess any tips or otc medicines would be great. I usually dont have too much of an issue going to sleep but just wake up every few hours and then am fully awake by 630.
NotSignal	Hi guysCurrently in where I live it, I find the humidity to be annoying for me (Australia). It doesn’t have to be super hot too but I do still notice the humidity which does impede my sleep I reckon. Apart from AC, are there any other strategies? I now sleep topless and use one blanket if I have to. But sometimes I find myself heated / sweated up in middle of nights. I have sleep maintenance insomnia
NotSignal	It kills me! The worst part is I wake up early in the morning and only get like 5 hours of sleep throughout the night. This has happen for over a month. I don’t know if it’s my anxieties is the problem why i can’t go back to sleep or what.
Signal	So backstory here, I’ve had anxiety and insomnia for about 5years. I naturally only need about 5 hours a night, and I’m very nocturnal: if left by myself I will sleep from 7am to 1pm and that’s about it. I’m so used to not sleeping that I can easily go 48hours without sleep. I’m on medication for it and also do a lot of sleep hygiene etc. I also go to therapy once a week. Problem is, in the last three nights I’ve had a combined 8 hours of sleep despite doing everything right. Medication is the same, I’ve been outside, I eat healthily, I stopped smoking and drinking coffee after 5pm. This is super upsetting, and also it’s starting to be really bad for my work. I’m a student so usually this is fine, but I have an essay due tomorrow. The essay in itself isn’t even a source of stress because I have made good progress on it, but I’m so tired I can’t even finish the last 1000 words. I also just don’t know when I would write it because when I do fall asleep I’ll probably sleep for 15 hours (no exaggeration). And right now I’m just waiting for my GP to start their day so I can call them. Anyway just wanted to vent. PS I already got an extension on my essay so that’s not even an option
Signal	Hey guys, first post in this sub, sorry if this has been asked about before, I couldn't find anything that answered my question in the search. Basically, I used to have severe depression, got hospitalized a bunch, etc. I've had insomnia since around that time (10+ years), but my depression hasn't been a thing for quite awhile.Recently, as in the last 3 or 4 months, my insomnia has been the worst it's ever been, with a "good" week having about 10-12 hours of sleep. I've been doing everything I can think of, staying away from electronics/screens within 2 hours of wanting to head to sleep, not eating or drinking too late, and I've resorted to taking Zzzquil/Benadryl for a few nights in a row and still not falling asleep.After about 5 days of getting a grand total of 3 hours of sleep, I feel like I've lost my mind, I'm crying my eyes out at night wishing the roof would collapse on me and that would knock me out, I have migraines all day and panic attacks because my heart is beating faster than normal and I can't pay attention to anything. I'm just confused because emotionally, I've been healthy and fine until the last 2 months, because the insomnia has worn me down to my breaking point.I tried to explain to my parents and doctors but they all insist that the reason I can't sleep is because of anxiety and depression, and that upping my antidepressants and going to a therapist will fix the problem. I KNOW that I don't have depression or anxiety in my life currently except for what's being caused BY the insomnia. Does anyone else have any answers or ideas on how to treat this, or advice from anyone who has had the same problem? I don't know if I should see a different type of doctor, like a neurologist or sleep doctor, and my health insurance is kind of shitty so I'm a little concerned about the cost of seeing anyone who will just shrug and send me home or to someone else.Sorry for the long post, I'm at the end of my rope and I appreciate any help I can get.
NotSignal	Sup guys,I put together a little pdf yesterday of some of the best relaxation techniques I've used to help me mostly beat my insomnia without needing any pills or anything. Pills and supplements can definitely help, but that shit is expensive. Let me know if you want the pdf and I'll message you it.
NotSignal	I’m interested what the most effective guaranteed to work medications are because everything I’ve tried don’t do shit for me
Signal	I've always been a "bad" sleeper, takes me minimum of an hour to fall asleep at night, but once I get over the hurdle of falling asleep, the rest of the night goes just fine. I used to have a stretch of bad nights about every 6 weeks, which was fine, not fun but totally manageable. I wouldn't have even described that as insomnia tbh. However, I had a baby 9 months ago and since that pregnancy began, my sleep has been progressively worse. Baby's been sleeping through the night since 6 months, so that's not the issue.&#x200B;The first bad bout of insomnia came during first trimester of pregnancy, which isn't out of the usual. It went away after probably 2 weeks. I managed it by taking Unisom, which is safe to take during pregnancy.&#x200B;The second bout came when my baby started sleeping through the night. I had about 2 weeks straight of simply not being able to fall asleep. I'd be so tired that I couldn't even get up and read, because I couldn't keep my eyes open. But I'd lie in bed, so relaxed that my Fitbit watch recorded it as sleep, and just not fall asleep. I could only finally pass out around 4am or even later. I tried taking Unisom or Benadryl and neither made any difference. After 2 weeks from hell, I cut out caffeine (which I've drank in moderation my entire adult life with no side effects) and like magic, my sleep immediately went back to normal. I'm still heartbroken over giving up coffee, but if I have even a half cup, my sleep that night will be awful, so it's not worth it. I haven't gone back since.&#x200B;Now I'm in the middle of another bout. It's been three weeks since I've been able to fall asleep without taking medication. I had Unisom left over from my pregnancy and my routine has been: go to bed around 10pm, try to sleep, get up 11/11:30pm to take a half Unisom, fall asleep by midnight. If I ever didn't take the Unisom and just tried to push through, I'd be up until 4am or whenever I finally caved and took something. My cycle returned about a week before this bout of insomnia started...&#x200B;All this to say: does anyone have experience with hormone-related insomnia? It seems obviously related to me that my 3 worst bouts of insomnia have been first trimester pregnancy, baby stops breastfeeding at night, and first cycle postpartum. &#x200B;I went to see a sleep specialist just yesterday since I ran out of Unisom (I bought it in the US when I was visiting over a year ago, but I don't live there and it's not sold where I live). I mentioned my theories about hormones and the specialist wasn't really interested in exploring that. He agreed it might be related and prescribed me Mirtazapin. I took it last night at just 3.75mg dose and it made me so tired - but I still lay in bed awake for 2 hours (much more tired than usual) before falling asleep around midnight. This morning, I could barely open my eyes and was very groggy all morning, which makes me think this medication might not be right for me.
Signal	I’ve been having bouts of insomnia for the past month or so, but never has it been worse than this week. I haven’t had a full night sleep four or five days. Tonight I have an overnight connecting flight, so I definitely won’t be sleeping well tonight (if at all). I think I’ve been so anxious about my upcoming trip and trying to get sleep this week in anticipation for tonight because I know I won’t be sleeping. I feel shaky, and like I can’t concentrate. I’m in grad school so I’m constantly working. I have 6 hours of class today before my flight and assignments due. Anyways I just mainly wanted to vent. If anyone has any tips for sleeping/napping on flights or in airports, I’m all ears.
Signal	Hear me out here, since this happened to work for me. May not work for other people. I didn't try to sleep when I couldn't sleep. I got up and did whatever until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. I ended up falling asleep after about 50 hours at 2:00 PM. I ended up staying asleep until midnight. I then stayed awake for 24 hours and went to sleep at midnight the next night. The next day, I took a sleeping aid (with GABA, which is an amino acid that inhibits brain activity) at about 11. I couldn't stay awake any longer and fell asleep at midnight. For the last week or so, I've been naturally falling asleep at midnight and waking up at 8-9AM. Again, this process might not help everyone, but so far it's been working for me. If this helps at least one other person, it was worth the effort of posting.
Signal	Woke up about an hour ago and can not sleep. Nothing ever works. Took a Benadryl and have used melatonin. Can’t get my room 109 percent dark. Then I don’t get enough work done because I’m so tired.
NotSignal	I still live at home, but if i join work ill have to sleep early. But my family sleeps at 1am, and I want 9 hours sleep. Which means I gotta sleep at 10 to fallasleep at 11 and wake up at 8 am.My father and mother both sleep in the same room with me. And donot let me sleep. I am not a deep sleeper. And I wake up when someone turns on the light at night. How do I go about this situation. Im being blamed for not sleeping and getting angry. When Im trying to get disciplined as they say, but they wont let me sleep peacefully.Also they sleep jn the afternoon, but i donot get sleepy in the afternoon. This results in me getting bad sleep and having insomnia.
Signal	Well, yesterday I posted about how my insomnia has lasted for so long that I was starting to have auditory hallucinations of music. &#x200B;Well last night I got a good four hours of sleep, as apposed to the usual one hour for the last month, so I am a bit more awake and alert today. I have to admit, I started a very detailed craft project last night and I think it mentally exhausted me to where I could sleep.&#x200B;Anyone else have any remedies they use that DON'T include sleeping pills or other medications?
Signal	I’m seventeen and recently I’ve got insomnia because of coming off a medication, I’m just wondering if not sleeping could stunt brain development. Is it worth taking benzodiazepines or something like that or is that just worse for the brain? I did try melatonin but I’m worried it will cause my brain to stop producing it. I’ve tried 4-7-8 breathing and stuff like that but it didn’t work. I’m really worried. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
NotSignal	I have not slept yet and probably going to just watch stuff in the tv until sunrise. Idk what to do with my life anymore, I'm basically just emotionally numb.
Signal	I hate that I’m up right now because I have terrible anxiety about tomorrow and I’m also going through a terrible breakup that cut so bad it hurts for me to even breathe right now. I have to take a train at 7am ugh. Not to mention I took 100 mg of trazodone like 6 hours ago. I guess it’s safe to say that trazodone has nothing on my racing mind and anxiety. Just a little venting
Signal	So I've had insomnia thats been going on/off since I was born, my workplace has been feeling like home to me just until 1-2 months ago when my boss left and was replaced, we were in very good connection on the level of friends and the new one doesnt connect with me as well, my social status has decreased since then and I've become very moody and depressed when I'm there.Well for the past few weeks, because of an increasing medical condition that affects my ability to do my job, I was ordered to stay home, and to my surprise, my depression stopped, insomnia has weakened (I find myself sleeping for 6-7 hours whereas I would sleep 3-4 hours before) and I even became so much happier, so is there a chance my work social status is affecting my insomnia? If so, is there anything I can do about it?
NotSignal	I don’t have any nice thoughts to fall asleep on at all, nothing that I personally look forward too or want to do, all I think about is that I need to go to sleep so I can feel better the next day, but that’s not really a good enough motivation to waste 8 hours doing nothing so I’ll usual try it for 20 - 30 minutes lying down with my eyes closed but it’s never reliable or a good consistent way to get to sleep every night.
Signal	I’ve slept maybe three hours in the past 20. I’ve been to work, ran errands, took 20mg of melatonin and it’s 5am. I am so tired I can’t keep my eyes but when I go to fall asleep my mind goes a million different directions and I start getting anxious and feel my heart beat and breathing get faster. Does this happen to anyone else does anyone have any suggestions?
NotSignal	I think this triggers my insomnia more than anything. Can't shake the feeling something's off when that happens then I can't fall asleep for several hours.
Signal	I’m living with insomnia since 3 months now. I know some of you might have been living with it longer than me. Those three months have been hell because of me. Yep. I’m an overthinker and anxious so because i had a sleepless night once, I freaked out and got this fear of being able to sleep anymore (which is irrational) The trigger is gone, but the insomnia remained and it transformed into another phobia ; not sleeping for days. (a row)From then it just became worse. It started with minor on set insomnia then it became on set & maintenance insomnia, because im too anxious. For sometimes it was paradoxical insomnia but it’s been two weeks since its not paradoxical anymore. I am now afraid of not only my own bedroom, but from any bed. I tried to sleep in the guest room and couldn’t sleep. I tried to sleep on a DIY bed in my parents room (yes, im 21 and still live with my parents, dont judge plz) and there’s no place, not even the couch, where I am able to sleep. When I can, I get 2-3-4hours of sleep, but they became very rare. Sleepless nights are more frequent and I don’t know what to do anymore.My parents don’t support me, they blame my phone for the reason why I don’t sleep. Not only that but they kinda convinced me to not get help from anyone (therapist or GP). They say i’m crazy. I tried OTC meds, and it worked for a while, now it dosen’t. I’m tolerant to the only rx meds i’ll ever get (zopiclone) I even took 15 mg multiple times and it knocked me out only once. Before that, I was the “straightest” person. I never drank alcohol, never even thought about smoking. Now, sometimes get drunk so that i’d fall asleep more easily and be less anxious about going to bed, but everytime it backfired ; whenever my head touches my bed it’s like the drunk/tipsy sensation is gone. I’m seriously considering to start smoking weed at this point. On top of that I’m addicted to pills. I’m looking for anything that could make me sleep, it’s awful. I feel guilty about it but a couple weeks ago, before quarantine started, I went to my grandparents house knowing that they have a bunch of pills, and I stole 2 ativans (that I never used because I lost them) Although insomnia dosen’t affect me physically yet, It has its effects mentally. I feel like i’m becoming depressed, not suicidal.I dropped out 2 of my classes at college because I couldn’t keep up on the work. I was too absorbed by my insomniaI just miss my life. I feel like this is never going to end. I started to watch a channel on YouTube called insomnia insight and the sleep physician talks about insomnia and everything is says about it is true!! However, I tried to apply the most basic thing tonight (not be pressured to sleep) and I didn’t succeed. I applied a few rules of CBT-i in the past 2 months. - using my bed only for sleep- giving myself a 5hours sleep window (that i almost never respected If I found myself sleeping when my alarm rang) - going to bed later than I actually would (not working cause im never sleepy) Nothing worked because for some reasons , I can’t calm the hyperarousal from my brain all day/all night. I am never feeling sleepy or when I am it’s only for a few minutes. I want to try to do it all (CBT-i) but because you have to be up at your designed wake up time everyday, I am afraid it’s gonna backfire on me and i’ll be up for days since I struggle a lot to even get an 1 hour of sleep these days. I miss the good old days when I went to bed at 10pm and watched netflix in my room and feel myself falling asleep around 11pm and would wake up at around 7 or 8am. I was known for not being able to go to bed late.I feel like i’m never gonna go back to that and i’m so mad about myself, because this is my fault, i created this whole insomnia bullshit. As i’m finishing to write this, it’s 6:30am and I was wide awake all night, I will get up at 7:00 am and start my day, because I can’t sleep during the day and for some reasons, i am not a napper. I hope next nights are going to be better. If you read everything thanks for coming to my ted talk.
NotSignal	I used to be the first one asleep at sleepovers, I used to never be able to pull all-nighters, I used to be able to put my head down and fall asleep in 15 minutes. Suddenly I have extreme anxiety about not being able to get enough sleep (or ever going to sleep). I know I will eventually fall asleep but I have schoolwork to do and I have an assignment due tonight but I can't think straight and it's too risky to try and fall asleep for a couple hours in bed because what if I don't? Every time I'm dosing off even just a little my brain jumps in and reminds me I'm trying to fall asleep. Hours pass just laying in bed closing my eyes, trying to focus on my breathing, but it just doesn't work. When I absolutely need to sleep I can't and I'm starting to lose my mind. I know 33 hours is nothing to some of you but I've always slept pretty well. I went to the store and bought some Melatonin gummies and they didn't work at all. How do I get through this the smoothest and healthiest way possible?
Signal	It is currently 1:54am and i have taken 2 sleeping tablets that according to my mum SHOULD make me sleep as she used to have 1 when she had insomnia during pregnancy and she said that would make her fall asleep pretty quick. However, these tablets are not working for me, and my family have been very worried about my problems with insomnia. I have tried literally everything I can to get sleep, making my bed as comfortable as possible and thinking the usual thought process that got me to sleep for the first 18 years of my life, and nothing seems to work, and I end up sweating and tossing and turning every night, getting only like 3 hours of sleep a day. I have come to the conclusion after doing research that i do not have regular insomnia, but instead I have hot flushes and night sweats which are what is keeping me awake, and it feels as though my brain is producing adrenaline late at night unwillingly.I am obsessed with gym and I train late, but I have been denying that as the cause as I have trained late for 3 years and there never were any problems. I do not get much cardio done as I train a lot of weights. Should I get some cardio now is that risky for my health, and/or should I take 1 rest day from weights to let my brain heal or is it harmless to my situation?Final question: is there any home things that can be done not to do with medication that can help relieve hot flushes or night sweats?Would really appreciate any answer :)
Signal	WHAT WORKS FOR YOU?hello all. I (F21) struggle hard with anxiety and have found it extremely difficult to get a solid sleep that lasts over 4 hours for the past 7 months. I’ve tried lots of things, sleeping pills and all but not much is working. It doesn’t help that I’m a pessimist towards everything. besides sleeping pills/ prescribed medication, WHAT CAN I DO?E.g. warm showers before bed, aromatherapy, eating or drinking something specific before bed .... anything!!!
NotSignal	It’s 3:30am and I’ve been lying here for 5 hours next to my sleeping husband. I feel like crying, but I don’t want to wake him. This is absolute torture.
NotSignal	For the last 4-5 days I've been having so much trouble falling asleep. I don't know why, I read before bed, meditate, do exercise throughout the day, don't consume coffee, alcohol, drugs or smoke, don't eat food late and am not anxious or depressed. I have also recently started getting Hypnagogic Dreams/Imagery, not sure if that has anything to do with it. I'll be on the verge of half falling asleep but struggle to get past it. I find the imagery from it to be sort of distracting. Can someone please give me some help with this?
NotSignal	I'm fine during the day, tired in the morning, but every night, I get a boost of energy like I just downed Kyle's fridge for 2 day in 1 second, and I always try to sleep, fully ready for ths hay, but I just can't, and what sucks worse is my mom who gets up in the middle of the night 3 times atleast and I have to pretend to be asleep so I dont get yelled at. I guess what I'm trying to say is, does anyone else have this problem, minus the mom part?
NotSignal	Its every. Single. Night. I swear this will be the night I sleep no matter what and it never happens, its 5am and my alarm goes off in an hour.I'm just so tired. Physically and emotionally, this is draining me and I dont know what to do. I just want to sit and cry honestly, i have a stressful day ahead of me and I dont know how I will survive.I feel fragile, like if one person says the wrong word to me today I will just snap.Does anyone have tips on overcoming stress in order to sleep? Its driving me insane. I cant do this anymore.
Signal	I've been seeing a new sleep dr (one who isn't forcing Xyrem down my throat) and we've been trying various Z drugs on the weekend to help me sleep in (I work late on weekends).Ambien sort of worked, and we're now considering trying Ambien CR. But, I almost think it's making me depressed/spaced out a day or two after taking it, especially if I take it two days in a row.He's leaning towards Sonata next (and just taking it twice to keep me asleep), but there's an allure to taking CR and sleeping a normal 6-8 hours on weekends.Wondering if anyone else has experienced light depression from Ambien, and if it was better on Sonata.
NotSignal	I used to have episodes of sleep paralysis a lot. It happens when I’m extremely exhausted. When I was younger, I would have hallucinations. One I can’t forget is “The many hands man” basically slender man with multiple arms in a priests gown. Has anyone ever experienced visions? Share your story.When I’m slowly drifting off to sleep, it happens. I don’t freak out anymore when it happens. I steady my breathing. Then, slowly try to wake my body up by wiggling my toes and fingers. It works for me.
NotSignal	If I can get 6 hours (even if it’s interrupted), I am very happy. Usually I get 4-5 on average. Sleep is basically always a struggle for me. Ugh
NotSignal	So I'm taking taking answers from anyone who's willing to answer this (Please answer this T.T)If you were to play a board game or a card game based on insomnia, how do you think that game would be played and what in your opinion do you think should be involved in the game, to make people more aware of what insomniacs go through? Or are there already existing games that you know of?I'll take any answers pleaseee :3🙏🏽
Signal	I quit smoking back in November and the first couple days without nicotine I didn’t sleep at all and I just figured it was a short term side effect but it’s the end of February now and I still have issues every other night falling asleep and/or staying asleep i don’t even really think about having a puff or two anymore it’s just when I try to sleep I can’t. I’ve taken melatonin and it works sometimes and I’m on a tight sleep schedule and I turn off my phone and shit 3 hours before I go to bed but I still struggle. A part of me wants to go back to smoking because I’ve never struggled with sleep like this before! Does anybody know if this side effect will ever end??? I can’t find anything on the internet at all and I don’t want to start on prescription sleep pills.
Signal	Background: I've been dealing with this for 6+ years. I don't have any diagnosed sleep disorders, and doctors have had no idea how to help. I've been given melatonin prescriptions before, but they've made symptoms worse. I deal with chronic nightmares, a lot of restlessness, fatigue, and inability to sleep well. While I can fall asleep quickly, there are days where anxiety will forcefully keep me up. I'm now scared of going to bed, and I'm beyond depressed.My nightmares are incredibly violent. Most of them involve death, torture, fighting, monsters, end of the world scenarios, so on. They're vivid dreams and some are lucid. As of late, I've been waking up after 5-6 hours of rest, feeling exhausted. I then try to rest again, only for the nightmares to get worse. This leaves me having slept for 10-14 hours, only to feel completely exhausted and paranoid. Also, when I feel like I haven't been able to accomplish much, my body will try to push me out of bed the moment I try to rest. (Like now, for example.)It feels like I'm going mad. I just want to know what I have and be able to rest.
NotSignal	Hello. I had mild corona symptoms from from last wednesday. I am supposed to be recovering now, but I can't feel anything because I have developed bad insomnia. As soon as I go to sleep, I am aware of my body and lose any potential sleep. My doctor prescribed me Hydroxyzine HCL and it is still doesn't work, just tried. Been like this for 4 days already and it is tough. I am usually very active, 2 weeks ago before illness I ran 2 9mile sections. At work I walk at lunch for 4 miles. And I was about to unpack my mountain bike to go riding. Now I can't do anything.
NotSignal	Why? Why don’t you let me sleep?Why? Why do you keep me up? This lifestyles hard to keep.Just let me count the sheep.Why? Why can’t I stay asleep?Just let me fall in deep.Why? Why must you keep me up?Pretty soon I’m going to have to get up.
NotSignal	I work 12 am to 8 am, when I get home, if i fall asleep even at 3 pm and wake up an hour later I will absolutely be unable to fall asleep again.If I sleep at 9 am, while still tired the chances of me sleeping for 7-8 increases, but the amount of time before going to work increases.The issue today is I went to sleep at 1 am and slept to 11:30 am. and I don't work until 12 am. So that's 12 hours up.. before work
NotSignal	Hey - do you or someone you know have sleep issues ? I'm trying to gather feedback from insomniacs and entrepreneurs with sleep troubles, occasional or ongoing for my own start up project. There is a prize draw for a lucky winner: A free sleep therapy session. And here is the link to the survey [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/N9L2XJG](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/N9L2XJG) - thanks a lot in advance- julie
NotSignal	Having chronic pain that is a 8 or 9. Doctors trying to put me on anti depressant (zoloft) first to balance my mood.3 day on have not slept at all. Going crazy. Went to hopital a few days ago. Now what?
Signal	THIS IS A CONDENSED VERSION OF MY STORY. History: No previous mental health issues until this point, aged 29, this can REALLY happen to anyone. The Cause: Stress, I was in the process of emigrating which was all very 50/50 up until the last minute, along with this uncertainty and constant stress of the process, there was also work pressure which became too much. The Insomnia: I was a regular 8hr sleeper, maybe waking up once or twice a night to use the bathroom, then literally out of nowhere BOOM 3hrs of broken sleep then into work…. the next night the same…. The next night the same… this snowballed so fast it’s hard to comprehend now I’m out the otherside, the worst I can recall was 5hrs total sleep over 4 days/night…. At this point I could not function let alone do my job…. Luckily for me my work is project based and happened to be quiet at time, I took a week off to try and catch up on sleep and to try and recharge myself, but this was no use…. You see the vicious cycle is: You’re awake when you should be asleep > creates anxiety/stress > tired which feeds anxiety/stress> your body/mind then enters fight or flight mode(you must be staying awake for a reason it thinks right!?)>this then makes the possibility of falling asleep almost impossible, the worst I can remember of this was at the very start when I would be close to falling asleep and I would either get a rush of adrenaline or a physical spasm or jerk, torture, there’s no other word to describe it. I genuinely thought at this point my life as I knew it was over, this was a new normal for me, barely being able to get through the day and killing myself just to do that, all the enjoyment sucked out of life, it’s almost like you’re in a fantasy watching everyone else go about their normal lives, people who have had insomnia will understand this. My insomnia lasted a total of 6 months, I’d say 2/3 of these months were ‘severe’ …3-4 hours of sleep every night no exceptions or miracles. The Recovery: After trying numerous natural remedies (I knew I was beyond this, but to progress to medication I had to go through these options) I was finally prescribed with Zopiclone, this would help me fall asleep but the first time I would wake up that would be it, awake until the alarm, this would maybe get me 4 hours of sleep, it wasn’t the drug that was the problem, it was me: Over this period of insomnia I’d just developed a ton of really bad and anxious habbits that weren’t there before, having to have everything PERFECT before going to sleep, If I remembered something that wasn’t I’d have to get up and go sort it, my pillow had to be PERFECT…. Room temperature PERFECT … if any of these weren’t, I would get annoyed thus not sleeping….. the turning point for me arrived two pronged at the same time, I was prescribed Lorazepam/Ativan 2mg and along with this had just had my worst night sleep to date, all I can describe of the next day It was almost like my body/mind had gotten sick of being sick, sick of hearing my own voice talk about the same things sleep sleep sleep, sick of being tired, to the point where over night I completely let go of all caring, I’m so tired and bored I genuinely don’t care what happens now, sleep no sleep… whatever…. Keep my job lose my job… whatever… and this is how fucked up and cruel the body and mind can be… it was at this point of being so low, that I started to recover. Along with this new frame of mind (no doing of my own) and my new medication, I began to sleep again…. Initially 6hrs of broken sleep…. 7hrs of broken sleep….. 5hrs of solid sleep followed by 2hrs of sleep…. 4hrs of sleep followed by 4 hrs of sleep… etc. etc. In a little over 2 months I had my life back to a point where I was enjoying life to the fullest, but this medication had side effects, and I wanted to kick it and sleep naturally again, sleeping on Benzo’s is not as restful as sleeping naturally, best way to describe it is you’ll only ever feel like 7/10. The Taper: Over another 2 months I tapered off this medication, it’s as grim as everyone say’s it is, I found the initial drops to be the worst, once I got into the smaller doses I found the withdrawals manageable. I’m now completely clean and am sleeping 7/8hrs a night waking up 1-2 times, I’m proof that anyone can get this and ANYONE can beat this. Thank you.
Signal	I go through cycles of sleeping just fine and then there will be weeks of catching maybe 10 solid hours of sleep throughout a week. I’m in a cycle now and this is night 6 no sleep. I’ve noticed this time that when I am trying to sleep I’m disturbed by what I’m assuming are electrical pulses shooting through my brain. These keep me up and freak me out. They almost feel like mini bursts of adrenaline - like my brain is ass backwards right now. Tonight I ate 20 mg melatonin, smoked weed, did breath work and have been meditating through out the night and I feel absolutely wired, it’s 5 am here and I’ve been trying to sleep since 9.30pm. Shitty insurance has me hesitant on seeing a dr about this /: Any similar experiences?
Signal	Wanted to share my little piece of good news: had my first two nights of actual sleep without sleep meds in about 9 months!!! Fitbit tells me that I slept 6 hours 50 minutes Sunday night and 6 hours 10 minutes last night. Had alarms set, but I woke up before my alarms went off - like I used to do pre-insomnia. I feel good, and I’m happy about it. Wondering if it’ll last (I’m a pessimist) but will enjoy it while it does.
Signal	I'm very worried as I feel pretty calm and everything but my brain won't seem to fall asleep and I don't know why. I've tried a bunch of sleep stuff but nothing seems to be working. Why can't I seem to fall asleep and do any of you experience this type of thing?
NotSignal	Never manage to sleep and when I do I wake up and forget going back Tim the next night. Is this something a therapist would help you with too ? If not I don’t think I’ll consider one.
NotSignal	So I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety for a few years now, and it’s been pretty out of control lately. Ive also been having trouble sleeping. I tend to freak out and obsess over possible side effects of medications. I seem to struggle with worrying about my heart rate and I’ve tried certain antidepressants that have caused my heart to race and palpitations. My doctor prescribed me trazodone 50mg and I’m really nervous/ anxious to try It as I’ve read it could cause increased heart rate. Just wondering if anyone has had any problems/ side effects from trazodone?
NotSignal	I am not alive. I find no color in anything. Being awake feels like I'm suffocating and there's no escape. I lay in bed at night panicking about how much more it's going to hurt the next day, and how much irreparable damage is being done to my body and mind. Something has to give. I can't/won't live a life like this.I'm sorry if this is just bumming you out because I know so many of you are feeling the same thing, I just needed to get it out to some people that understand.
Signal	I’ve always had sleeping problems since I was 13 (19 now) but it’s at its worst it’s ever been now. I’ve done everything from stopping the usage of screens for like 6 hours , exercising , reading or trying to listen to relaxing sounds. I used melatonin everyday for like ever because it’s the only way I was able to sleep. I ran out a week ago too see if stopping would do anything different but I still haven’t been able to sleep. I’m going to buy some again today hoping I’ll be able to sleep again.If you guys have any tips or anything please help
NotSignal	Afraid to take it daily because of building tolerance so I’m wondering if there are some of you out there who have been taking it for a while and it still works for them??
Signal	I have to go to school soon but I can’t sleep. I’m going to feel horrible at school so I really want to just skip but I don’t think my parents would like it. What should I do?
Signal	Hey guys, lately i have been struggling with not being able to sleep due to the stress caused by my upcoming exams at uni. It never happened to me before, i was always able to sleep normally, untill at the end of the last semester one night i just wasnt able to sleep and now im so scared of not being able to sleep night after night. Its 1am as im writing this and it seems like this is going to be my third night on no sleep :(
NotSignal	So, there's this really strange problem I've noticed about a month ago. My body isn't as tired as my mind (does that make any sense?). What do I mean by that? Well, I'm going to sleep at around midnight, usually. But every now and then I just can't sleep. I just won't get tired enough, but on the next evening my body just puts itself to rest very quickly and I have a good sleep for about 16-18 hours. This goes on for 8-10 days. It isn't that strange to me anymore, except today. I was just sitting through the night, going on Reddit after I tried to sleep for 2 hours and then continued reading a book. Now, you should know that I train in table tennis basically every day, so if something is really wrong I will definitely notice the difference in focus and power. So, today I was getting back from readjng at 7am, made some coffee for me, put a bit of sugar in it and enjoyed a small breakfast. On the way to my training I noticed that the blood pressure in my head was out of control, didn't think much of it, since I'm used to headaches every once in a while. But the moment I put my head even just slightly lower than usual, it feels like my brain's disassembling itself. The pain got less when I got home later, but then I completely lost my sanity for the next few hours. I wasn't able to stop constant thinking about nonexistant things, it melted into the reality and now I still can't sleep. My body is weak af, but I just wont get rest. We don't have medication at home and it's 23pm so there really isn't a way I would get some. Now, if you're still here reading this, then I guess you understand what I mean. Maybe you can even relate to that, gone through this scenario yourself... How the fuck do I keep my sanity?Sorry, if this is kind of cringy to read, I have no idea what insomnia is actually like, since I don't have any references, but I thought this belonged here.
Signal	HiSo when I was younger I was like sleeping very well for 6 months or a year and then, a year without even sleeping and that. Then with 16/17 I started sleeping very very well until I was 19. With 18 years old I started to smoke a lot of marijuana and with 18, I tried to quit marijuana because I'm addicted to it. When I tried to quit, I couldn't sleep so I though it was because I had got used to sleep with weed. And I started smoking weed everyday again and I'm here, ready to turn 20. The difference is that now I can't sleep even on weed. I just can sleep very well (and not everytime) when I sleep with my boyfriend. But now even with weed I sleep aaaand even if I'm extremely tired I can't sleep. I can't close my eyes sometimes. And the next day I'm tired to death and I think "oh well I'll sleep perfectly tonight bc I'm tired" but it doesn't happen and I CAN'T BE THIS TIRED FOR THAT LONG
Signal	Hey guys, this is my third post in a week because no one in my family can understand my problem. Been having insomnia since December on and off, I know I have pretty bad anxiety but my dad doesn’t listen to me. My mind over thinks a lot and whenever I can’t sleep, I go into a spiral of thoughts.I never feel tired, even when I’ve worked out for 3 hours that day and practised good sleeping hygiene. This makes my mind think that my brain is losing the ability to sleep. I then go into a spiral of even more negative thoughts which keeps me up further. I know this is an irrational fear but I don’t know how to get it out of my head.When I do sleep it’s normally for 6-7 hours but I wake up 4 times. Taking a melatonin doesn’t really make me feel sleepy but it lessens the amount of time I wake up at night.At the moment I am not anxious of any other thing in my life except this. I’ve never had sleeping problems ever before in my life and it’s genuinely having a negative impact on my mental health. I’m very confused on what to do to make this better. Can someone please help?
Signal	Something about my partner being able to fall asleep in seconds makes my insomnia 10x worse. It makes me feel frustrated, angry, and restless - not at him but just at the fact that my sleep pattern is so far from normal. And then I can’t get to sleep because of my emotions AND my insomnia. Being breathed on or touched or to feel his body temperature even slightly emanating off him also ruins my ability to sleep. Needless to say, this double bed needs to be a king.
Signal	Okay so last night I finally managed to sleep after three days of sleeplessness. I went to bed earlier than I'm "supposed" to and I listened to a meditation. The next thing I remember is waking up, thought it was 1am or 2am but it was actually 5am. I see that my phone is where I put it when I go to sleep, and that I've put away my headphones. I open my phone and see I got to the end of the mediation. I have legitimately zero memory of getting up to put away my phone and stuff and then lying back down to go to sleep. Has anyone else experienced something similar, basically small memory loss? Also as I finally got some hours of sleep, I felt a lot better today. But now it's evening and I feel sleep deprived again, I feel that same strange detached emotional panic that sleep deprivation gives me. I know catching up on sleep takes time but is it possible to feel sleep deprived from past lack of sleep after a night's sleep? Thank you :))
Signal	I took 3 hydroxyzines tonight to help me sleep and even though I’m so damn tired, every time I shut my eyes my thoughts start racing and it snaps me back into wakefulness. I’ve noticed I usually can’t fall asleep until 6-7am even with it. I’m almost at my breaking point to where I wanna say fuck it and take like 7 or 8 more and just see what happens.
NotSignal	I get like 2 hours of sleep a night is there anything I can get for this as a minor I’m 16 in Florida over the counter stuff doesn’t work for me
NotSignal	The past couple months have been awful. I’m decided to call a sleep doctor today after another night of lying in bed for 6 hours just to sleep 4. Do I call a sleep doctor or primary? And any med suggestions specifically whatever doesn’t have crazy side effects. I’m okay with being groggy af in the morning totally beats lack of sleep I work nights anyway so I can spend an hour sitting on my ass pounding coffee till it’s fine to wake up. I just can’t do this anymore. I hate my body, I hate that it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do
NotSignal	I’ve been going to sleep at 6am and waking up at 2pm for the last few weeks. I decided to fix my sleep schedule, so last night I pulled an all-nighter and planned to go to bed at 11pm tonight. Been in bed for 4 hours and can’t sleep, even though all day I could barely keep my eyes open.
NotSignal	My parents don’t want me to get another bottle because they are afraid of me depending on it!! But I find no harm !! I take low doses and often relax on it only ! It just helps me sleep and wake up at a certain time! I’m past my sleep and I don’t feel tired at all!!!!
NotSignal	Hello, occasionally I have the night that I fall asleep and then I wake up 4-5 later, (for example fall asleep at 00:00am and then wake up at 4:30am) and then when I try to fall alseep again, I just wake up shortly after (for example 5:17am) then I fall asleep again and the same happens, why? this happens specially when I sleep well the previous night.
NotSignal	Hello!Over the past 4 months I’ve experienced an intermittent issue falling asleep where my mind will be so calm that I start to drift off and dream, yet after a few seconds my body will jerk me awake. This will happen repeatedly (10+) until I’m fully awake and no longer sleepy. Sometimes it’s my legs kicking, but most often it’s my arms / shoulders. The sensation is that of when you’re falling in a dream.Once this starts happening it usually takes me 2-4 hours to fall asleep, and then the sleep itself is fitful. I’ve developed some fear of sleeping itself because of this.I had a sleep study done and I don’t have apnea, and the sleep clinic seemed uninterested in anything besides selling people CPAP machines.Has anyone else had this issue? Any ideas or suggestions?Thanks!
Signal	I have a super loud mind. I can’t seem to not constantly be thinking about what I’m going to say, or talking. When I’m in bed trying to go to sleep, it seems like my brain talks to itself; keeping me up for hours and hours on end. I have to wake up between 6-9am everyday and I know I’m not getting enough sleep.I had a bad case of insomnia my junior year of high school. I would go to sleep around 1-4am and wake up at 5am everyday. It was awful and it affected my mental health and schoolwork a lot.I got a lot better about not staying up so late after my mom took me to the doctor after I had an incident where I started to get tunnel vision in my left eye while I was at school.But since March, I’ve been dealing with the same problems all over again. I’ll stay up until 4-6am every night and I wake up early and go to work or go running. It seems impossible to go to sleep and I’ve tried everything. Dark room, night light, melatonin, no electronics an hour before bed, tea, no caffeine. I guess I should note that I do drink about 1 or 2 cups of coffee every morning (otherwise I can’t even function properly.)I’ve tried kicking out caffeine, but I genuinely can’t live without it because I’m so fatigued all the time. My entire family are night owls. But they can actually sleep in after staying up late, I can’t. And when they go to bed, they go to sleep. I also can’t do that.Any suggestions on what to do??
NotSignal	Anyone else deal with anxiety because of chronic nightmares whenever they try to relax and sleep? Like I won't be thinking about it and I'll be tired and try to lay down. I close my eyes and suddenly I'm mid-panic attack. I narrowed it down to being worried about nightmares even though I'm so used to them that when they happen it doesn't bother me. Like I have nights I will wake up every hour or so from a vivid nightmare. But I never got bothered by it, since my thought process was always "Eh, just a nightmare. Nothing to worry about." and I'd go back to sleep. But lately I have had these panic attacks that always correlate with me actually having nightmares the next time I sleep. Anyone else experiencing this issue or have any advice on how I can try to battle this? I'm definitely bringing this up to my therapist because this is odd to me. Usually I don't have panic attacks when I'm at home relaxed, but now I just can't stop hyperventilating and panicking every time I try sleeping.
NotSignal	Ok, currently its 05:00 or 5am, I haven't gotten any sleep and i just heard a weird voice in my head. It kinda sounded like whispering but wasn't, i couldn't make any sense of it and it went on for about 20 seconds. is this because of sleep deprivation? Has anyone else experienced this?
NotSignal	Like melatonin and stuff. What would you say is too young? Specifically, is it okay for the ages 12 - 16?
NotSignal	I know that many people here are frightened by a prion disease called Fatal Familial Insomnia and Sporadic Fatal Insomnia, but there is good news. A lawyer is working on a cure that looks promising. Sonia Vallabh was diagnosed with a deadly gene when her mother died for a prion disease, it was devastating news for her. From that day on Sonia and her husband Eric Minikel decided to find the cure, before the disease kills Sonia. The treatment consist in an antisense oligonucleotide, this a molecule that, when it reaches the brain could reduce the number of prions . This can slow the onset of the disease. Although it is being tested, it looks promising and hopeful for patients with prion deseases.
Signal	I want to post my nightmarish story from the last 6 months here in case it can help anyone. It all started back in September when i took nightly small doses of xanax to see if it was stress causing what I thought was gerd (i had a constant pain in my chest which seemed to be after eating and laying down). Once i was doing better on it, i realized it was stress so i quit taking it. Now I didn't think i'd have to use a taper schedule since it was only .5 each night for a couple weeks. but by the second night without it, i was totally awake all night. zero sleep.This was the first nite of my life I didn't sleep at all. nothing. I was so scared because I had to work in the morning I started panicking. My body quickly attributed trying to sleep with panic, and by the next night, not only was I awake from xanax withdrawal, but I started getting these jerks that would zap me awake just as I was entering sleep. At the time I didn't realize it was jerks through all the confusion and panic I just thought I had blanket insomnia. The panic grew, and by the third night without sleep I was going crazy.. thinking I had to somehow detox from the xanax and it would fix everything. So I checked into a "rehab" place that I thought would help me wean off the xanax and also they could try different sleep meds on me to find something to work. They gave me trazadone, muscle relaxers, seroquel and nothing worked. I was insane by this point having just constant panic attacks day and night. I had tremors, I couldn't eat, i was suicidal, I was a puddle of goo.I went home after a week there because they couldn't help me. And by the end of the week I went to a mental hospital to see what they could do. Right away the doc gave me Zyprexa 7.5mg which put me out. The next day i was reluctant to feel better because I thought it was a one and done drug that woudln't work the second night. Oh but it did. It was a miracle drug I thought. The class antipsychotic. It was a sister to Seroquel but it had the side effect of insane appetite stimulant, and daytime muscle jerks. But as long as it wasn't nightime jerks I was fine. I left the hospital and got better every day. By the third night it wasn't putting me to sleep anymore, it just removed my anxiety somehow so i was falling asleep before I even took it at night.All was well and good, and by Christmas, i had weaned all the way off of it - I was getting my life back. I was almost to a point where I wasn't thinking of sleep anymore, it was just natural like it used to be.But then we traveled up to family's house for the holiday. It was time for bed and I had a little stress about something, and layed to down to sleep, and bam! a small jerk that triggered a panic that rushed thru my body, i was hot, i was cold, i was tossing I coudln't get to sleep again, and it was midnight, then 3, then 6, and i knew whatever I had was back.I didn't even have my medicine with me, so I had to call the doc and he sent over a script but it took a couple days. So I was on vacation without sleep for 3 days again, and this was reminiscent of Sept when this first started. Same story - no sleep at all, just laying in bed in agony, desperate for rest for my exhausted body and mind. No appetite for anything not food, entertainment, no drive for life. The hardest part being having to surrender to meds again, which to a girl in her late child-bearing years is detremental as the class anti-psychotic causes amenorrhea.During these 3 days I didn't sleep at all, I was able to deconstruct what exactly was happening to me, i had hypnic jerks which are normal muscle spasms that can happen on sleep onset and most people can just go to sleep fine, but when a person has panic associated with them, they cause a positive feedback loop where the panic reinforces the jolt and they become so much more powerful and frequent.So for two months I'm back on zyprexa but this time instead of confidence it's healing me, i know it's just patching a monster inside that when my dose gets low enough will reappear and terrorize me once again. It's a different life living this way - always wondering when it's going to strike.And by the middle of Feb it did just that - I wasn't even tappered off all the way again, I had about 2 weeks left to go when stress at bedtime sent me into a nighttime frenzy yet again, but this time I was armed with supplies. Magnesium glycinate, 2 types of cbd oil, valerian root, propranolol. NOTHING put me to sleep.By the second night I had one thing left to try - something I read in a forum dedicated to this condition was helping some people. I figured it was 50/50 but it would treat the actual jerks, not just releive anxiety. Gabapentin (an anticonvulsant). I took 100mg and i laid there listening intently to my body's reaction.. my limbs feeling warm, and a little bit tingly, something is happening. I feel some muted jerks, they just sort of bump, but they don't send my heart racing. I turn on my side, i'm drifting, it's now or never - and jolt! but it's slightly muted something must be happening, i take another 100mg and i turn on my back, my heart is slowing, i'm drifting yet again, drifting, and just like that....... it's 8am. i can't fucking believe it. I slept! And I wasn't groggy as if it put me under, it just helped the jerks. What is even better than that is - the next night I got to sleep without needing it. This condition for me is 95% stress related. So just knowing I have this pill I can take is almost all i need. This is an as-needed drug I can take if I ever have this again, am I healed?? Can I start living my life again??? It's been almost a week and I'm alive once again, sleeping great, in anticipation for each new day the way it used to be.In my research I found this facebook support group (facebook/groups/1429301273827892/) that really helped me find things I could try to combat this problem. I hope it can help you too :)
NotSignal	So, that’s why I wake up multiple times during the night and have trouble getting to sleep. My stomach always feel tight and prone to pressure and it became uncomfortable to eat and I could not go to the bathroom! Finally figured out what was wrong. Thank god.
Signal	My insomnia has gotten to the point where if I want to get more than 30min of sleep after lying in bed for 6+ hours I have to be awake until I feel like collapsing, the last time I actually did this I was awake for 74 hours straight then I finally conked out since then its been 30 min tops because I reaaaaally don't want to have to stay up for THAT GOD DAMN LONG just to get a night's rest.
NotSignal	Yesterday I wrecked my car, and somehow survived with some minor head trama a bit above my forehead where the roof caved in a bit as the car rolled. I got really lucky in that it's just small trauma, I think most of the pain if coming from bruised skin on my forehead, no real headaches, but I haven't been able to sleep. The people in the emergency room said I seemed fine, but the paranoid side of me wont stop worrying that I caused brain damage and I'm stuck awake forever. Before you ask, yes I've always been this paranoid when I have sleep issues, accident or not. Logically I'm probably fine and all the emotion from all this has been keeping me awake, but I got to know, what are the chances I'm fucked?
NotSignal	Its really fun to actually fall asleep at a normal time just to wake up two hours later and not be able to fall asleep again.
NotSignal	So I don't know if this is already a thing or not but when I'm having trouble falling back asleep from waking up at 3am I just imagine that I only have 20-30 minutes until I HAVE to wake up and go to work. I don't, obviously, but the psychology behind only having a certain amount of time before you have to start your day sometimes helps me. Everyone Is different and I'm sure many others have tried this but I hope it helps somebody!
Signal	I'm so scared right now..for the first time in my life I went an ENTIRE night tossing and turning. Not a single fucking hour of sleep. Lately my insomnia has been getting worse and worse and my sleep patterns have been changing too. Some nights I'll get a full 8 hours of un interrupted sleep (which isn't normal for me), and others I'll get these insane bouts of insomnia..however tonight was so bad that I didn't even get an hour. What the fuck do I do..I've never had such insanely bad insomnia. I'm scared that this is going to happen again tomorrow night...someone help.
NotSignal	I'm just curious. Was it days, weeks, months, years ago? (Wanted to create a poll for this question, but that option isn't working)
Signal	21f- So I’ve noticed that about once a month (always starting on a Monday) I have these awful nights. (Usually the week after my period, don’t know if this has a connection) Lately it’s been going like this. I fall asleep by midnight or 1 am (which is normal for me during quarantine) but I doze off into a dream and immediately wake up when I realize it’s a dream. That’s when everything goes to shit. I haven’t been sleeping until 5-6 am and that’s after taking at least 100 mg of diphenhydramine so I don’t think that’s working. I sleep hours after drinking it. I guess I could be sleeping during my tossing and turning hours but it feels really unlikely. I have a thyroid condition and my insomnia only started once I was diagnosed with that. My levels were fine a few weeks ago but maybe they’re out of whack again and ruining my sleep. What really bothers me is how I’m waking up once I realize I’m dreaming. Does anyone have any tips on staying asleep? I feel like I only sleep in a very light stage. Any advice, comments, or stories would be helpful
NotSignal	I can’t seem to stop my brain. It’s operating at a fever pitch and every two seconds I’m reliving a new memory - some embarrassing, some sad, some that straight up make me want to melt into the earth. And I can’t find the turn off button. I’ve tried music, candles, milk, listening to my prof’s lectures. Nothing works. I’m so tired and so lonely and sad.
NotSignal	Does anyone else have issues with falling asleep due to hypervigilance/hyperarousal due to PTSD/CPTSD or some other cause? Not only are the CPTSD symptoms an issue, I've also got super sensitive hearing. It's genuinely making my life a living hell, since I live in an apartment complex in a city of more than 4 million people (which is quite a lot in my country) with a staggeringly violent crime rate. Although I grew up in a violent environment for most of my life, at least where I grew up in rural towns of between 50 and 200k people nights were quiet. When I go home now I usually wake up within 3/4 hours because of the sheer silence. I can't leave the city because there's no work outside of cities (especially with COVID) and I can't move, because I inherited my apartment (I am very fortunate and extremely appreciative about it, especially since it's in one of the best areas in the city) and I am lucky enough to live within 4 miles of my workplace. Proximity to the office is vital, because traffic in this city is horrendous and I've spent up to 2 hours sitting in traffic on my way home at times. Does anyone know whether there's some way to deal with the hypervigilance? I'm currently trying to sort out my buget and free up enough money to see a psychiatrist, but it's going to take a while on my current salary. Over here a 15 minute psychiatric appointment will cost you around $70 while a decent salary range (more than I make) would be around $800 a month. It's also unlikely that a GP would prescribe a sleep aid here. Earplugs are useless as not only do they givd me ear infections, I've also got tinnitus which only really bothers me when I wear earplugs. Does anyone else have advice on dealing with similar issues surrounding hypervigilance/hyperarousal?
Signal	So when I finally DO fall asleep, I get up every 90 minutes or so to pee, and now I'm experiencing hallucinations during that phase when you're partially asleep but waking up, often a very vivid, terrifying things causing me to jump the f\*ck out of bed, terrified, and when the light comes on, I realize it was never real. Sometimes the hallucinations are auditory, and I'm starting to question reality.I'm reaching new levels of sleep deprivation I didn't think was possible. Battling insomina since like 2002, severe nocturia since 2011, and now this. I can't deal with this. I don't trust my own senses, or brain, anymore.
NotSignal	I watched all of dont fuck with cats and I’m just on edge now and I keep imaging really creepy shit and so I’ve been keeping myself up afraid to go to turn off the lights and go to sleep.
NotSignal	I haven't slept at all in 2 nights now.The problem I am having is that my body feels like it is buzzing with energy constantly, and my heart starts racing whenever I manage to almost drift off to sleep. I think my body is in flight or fight mode with an excess of adrenaline from being overtired. Has anyone had success with getting out of this body state?
NotSignal	hey, all my friends out there I was really suffering from insomnia until I came across this 100% free ebook that I am more than willing to share with you.&#x200B;if you want me to send it to you for absolutely free, just email me at [sarush346@gmail.com](mailto:sarush346@gmail.com)
Signal	i have gotten 3 hours of rough sleep in the last 48 hours and i’m so tired but i literally can’t fall asleep and there’s nothing i can take that we have in the house and i can’t go buy something because of coronavirus and i’m really struggling here
NotSignal	Hey all, as most of the world, since quarantine started my sleep has gone out the window. My 20+ years of dealing with an insomnia yoyo has helped by giving me the skills to take care of it. But i swear my pillow isnt helping, it's cheap and needs to be replaced. Any side sleepers with insomnia have a suggestion? I have neck problems and need support but as someone who struggles falling asleep I need something that I can also snuggle into. TIA!
NotSignal	I was just gifted a small vial of lavender oil today to help wth my sleeping problem. There is like a small metal ball at the top of the bottle, it has the same function as a roll on deodorant bottle. So I am apparently supposed to roll it on a few pressure points of mine and underneath my neck. I am actually curious if this will work, so does anyone know if this works or not.
Signal	I don’t know why this is happening to me. After coming back home from a hotel overnight, I suddenly had bad feelings from sleeping in my own room and I can’t sleep. The usual techniques I use for dealing with insomnia won’t work. I don’t know why but when I tried sleeping in other rooms, I have no problem.I’m not a believer but it’s hard not to entertain the idea that there might be a spirit in my room. Has any of you guys experienced this before?
Signal	I don’t even remember the last time I fell asleep before 4 am without the help of ambien or weed. I feel so exhausted right now and my head is pounding but I am just tossing back and forth all night long. It just feels like every night is a race against the sun and I’m so tired of it. I just want to be normal.
Signal	I just found out about it and realized it’s rare but I’m still horrified at the fact I can have it. I can’t fall asleep. I’m like tired but can’t fall asleep. Idk it’s probably just anxiety over it that’s keeping me awake. I’m just scared I’ll never go back to sleep again.
NotSignal	This is just me, but it doesn’t work for me. Like it sucks because everyone has been saying it has worked for them a lot but it just doesn’t work for me. It feels like I’m too focused on doing the method it makes me more not able to sleep lol.
Signal	Had a really bad bout of insomnia about a month ago. A few weeks of sleeping maybe like 3 hours a night yet still being pretty wired. Doctor prescribed I start resume taking anti-anxiety medication which was fine. Things seemed to start going back to normal. After I increased my dosage, I think I would sleep at 5 or 6+ hours a night at a reasonable hour. Big win in my book.Skip forward a month. Last night, I was feeling a bit antsy. I went to bed a my normal during the work week bedtime. Sleep for maybe an hour or so then woke up being wide awake. Laid in bed trying to fall back asleep but all these thoughts flooded my mind. Couldn't sleep so got up and tried playing some video games. Figured I'd just stay up at this point since I wasn't super tired. As soon as 6 am hit, got tired and ended up passing out. Slept for like an hour or so. Now I feel like crap. I think all the coronavirus shit and being stuck inside is getting to me. I try to avoid listening/watching the news because it depresses me at this point but that's all anyone wants to talk about so I end up seeing stuff even when I didn't intend on it. Plus I know people that are getting furloughed or laid off which makes me fear for my own job and concerned out their well-beings as well.Hoping this is a one time occurrence will be able to sleep normally tonight after getting this off my chest.
NotSignal	For the last month, I've constantly been waking up sometimes it feels like my throat has closed and I can't breathe while other times my mind just seems to wake up and I open my eyes.What could be causing this? I just want to be able to sleep through the night again.
NotSignal	I'm sure my alarm went off this morning at 8:30 am, but I think I woke up and turned it off and went back to bed and slept for hours. I can barely remember though. The memory is so vague every morning.I got to sleep around 5 am last night after looking at my phone until I was tired. It's 8:55 pm now so I'm going to head to the bathroom as soon as the clock strikes 10 pm, put my phone away, turn off my computer, and get ready for bed. I'll read a paper book if I can't sleep. Hopefully that'll help me stay awake in the morning and not go back to sleep in a daze.
Signal	I’ve struggled with insomnia for over a decade and it’s frustrating. I wanted to share this tho because it helps me sleep, especially when my thoughts just can’t slow down. On Spotify they have a podcast that is bedtime story’s for adults and it’s surprisingly very good at helping me fall asleep.
Signal	Hiya, firstly i have only just discovered this subreddit and I hope this post is ok. it’s been a while since I had suffered an extreme insomnia episode but I can feel that it’s happening again. I usually have issues falling asleep (my worst being three nights awake) but they’ve been fairly manageable the past couple of years. I was so tired yesterday arvo but didn’t sleep at all last night.... I drove 6 hours to visit family today and I still don’t feel tired. In fact i felt ABSOLUTELY normal the ENTIRE day. RN I feel dim but not tired. Basically I’m seeing the familiar signs of an insomniac episode. It’s currently 11:40pm and I’m wide awake. I absolutely hate sleeping pills. My friend swears by those sleep time/ meditation podcasts and I’m just wondering if you guys have any to recommend. Any recommendations would be extremely valuable rnPs worth noting that I took a LOT of breaks driving today. I also absolutely expected to stay the night at my family home if I felt too sleepy.... but I didn’t. I felt so ridiculously awake. Probably wasn’t the best decision to drive a long way without sleep but took my time and knew my limits.
NotSignal	Why did I let you go. Why did you mesh with my soul. Why did you leave me so cold. Why can’t I call you. Why do I think about you every night. Why did I get attached to your dog. Why aren’t the little things the same. Why did you move on without me. Why didn’t I win the game. Why aren’t you my one. Why isn’t sex the same. Why can’t you call.Why did I even start. Why did I ruin my own life.
NotSignal	Once you take the pill, how long does it take until you start feeling sleepy? Did you always feel sedation when you FIRST started taking the pill? Took my first dose of it last night at 15 mg. Didn’t really find it sedating or that it made me that sleepy. Took it around 12:45 am and I was still awake an hour and a half later. Not sure when I fell asleep but was up again around 7:20 am when my boyfriends alarm went off. Went back to sleep again. Forgot I set an alarm that woke me up again at 10 am then slept again until noon. Thinking of cutting the dose in half tonight.
NotSignal	So last night I went to bed, at 11:30 and I was so sleepy so I was sure I could fall asleep. The thing is I have some kind of black out from Let’s say 11:45 pm and 1:00 am. I don’t know If I fell asleep or not. I remember feeling myself so light as I was getting to a certain rythmn of breathing. I don’t recall any dreams. I know that after 1am I didn’t slept and at 4:30 I went downstairs on the couch trying to sleep there, but It was not a succes. I later realised that I on top of that, I am afraid of letting go. Am I the only one? What did/do you do to face that mental wall and fall asleep? at this point im ready to face my demons, and If the only way to do it is to face a number of sleepless night in a row, then let it be and I won’t care anymore.
Signal	I’ve never posted here (or anywhere) before but am hoping this might help someone. I’ve been an insomniac as long as I can remember. Over the years I’ve tried every over-the-counter sleep aid and supplement, vigorous exercise, yoga, cutting out caffeine, CBD, weed, binaural beats, noise-cancelling headphones, sleeping in a different places at different temperatures, reading, guided meditation etc. Some of these have helped me to fall asleep but I would always wake up several times during the night and have a hard time getting back to sleep. This past year I started a new job and was under a lot of stress. My sleep was even worse than usual and it took a huge toll on my health. My brain just didn’t work, I was in constant flight or flight, anxious and sick to my stomach. I was desperate and decided to try Ambien. Even that didn’t work! Sometimes it would get me to sleep but I would always wake up a few hours later even with the extended release version. The doctor gave me a note to take a couple of weeks off work but I didn’t feel right doing that so soon after starting and felt they would be better off finding a replacement. I quit my job (despite needing it). I felt bad about it but gave over a month notice. I had my blood checked to see if I was deficient in anything but everything came back as normal (including magnesium). I am physically very healthy and exercise most days. I started a new lower stress job and a low dose anti-depressant at the recommendation of my doctor but my sleep didn’t improve.A few weeks ago I came across this subreddit and saw a response somebody posted where they said that blue light blocking glasses and Magnesium Glycinate had worked for them. I didn’t a bit more research and decided to try it.I bought some $20 blue light blocking glasses which I now wear most of the time at work (on a computer all day) and any time I’m on my phone. My eyes definitely don’t feel as strained. I also started started taking Magnesium Glycinate (400 mgs) about an hour before bed and have been sleeping through the night for over a week now. I’ve taken Magnesium Citrate and tried a Magnesium spray in the past but apparently Glycinate is the way to go. I’m a little groggy in the mornings but that’s a small price to pay for a good night’s sleep. I’m so thankful to whoever posted that. It’s truly life-changing for me. I hope it continues to work and recommend trying out that combination to anyone else suffering from insomnia.
Signal	I can’t sleep at night. I stay up for days at a time and I’m prescribed temazepam, klonopin and even Xanax to help ease my thoughts and anxiety/depression but even they don’t make me sleep i can take extremely high dosages of all of them at once and I STILL CANT SLEEP now I’m hearing voices and seeing shadowy figures moving around and it just makes me even more paranoid, and i just got fired from work because of this shit
NotSignal	Now that we are in quarantine, we are using less energy on things(most of us anyways I'd like to believe), and this means our body is in less of a requirement of energy since we are less active now. I used to travel to school on bike a couple of miles before quarantine, now I'm finished taking online classes and rarely do much at all all day. So it's safe to say my body has rarely any use for much energy, thus I eat less and and sleep less. Sleep makes sense when the body needs recovery right? But spending most of the days inside requires very little recovery, and that's a valid reason for lack of sleep....? Is it safe to assume this?
NotSignal	Hello guys and girls,It might seem a little bit random but anyways I have to tell you all this. I wanted to thank everyone here on this sub, you all have helped feel me less alone with my problem and have been supportive when I posted a few months ago, right before my final exams.At the time, I could barely sleep for months and felt really bad. I feel like your wishes of succes helped me achieve a surprisingly good score (I was feeling really groggy through my whole exam session and could barely focus, so yeah I didn't expect much).Anyways, i made it! I made it through the exams, got rid of a lot of stress and even managed to sleep more again after some time.So yeah thank you people of r/insomnia and I strongly believe that you to can achieve your goals.Wishing you all the best of luck and some good resting! You're all part of an amazing and wholesome, supportive community!Lots of love,Kamiel(P.s. feel free to comment if you need support, I will try my best to help and I am sure there will be others!)
NotSignal	Sometimes, I like to imagine what it would be like if we had an off-and-on switch, or at least a timer. Like imagine that, you can set the amount of hours you need & then snooze!! I know I know, that's making us into robots (& there would also be downsides to it). But some days (or nights), that would be a blessing.😊 🌛
NotSignal	My sleepiness nights always come in pairs. After the first night I usually feel okay at work, I have a little extra adrenaline helping me out. However, the second night I can't ever get comfortable and I have that "dried out" feeling. It's like being that tired is making it impossible to get comfortable enough to sleep. I'm on my third night which is usually when I just collapse into bed and sleep for 10 hours, but it's late and I'm wide awake again.Ambien has stopped working. It worked well for about a year but I guess my time is up.I'm just extra worried about it now since during the time the Ambien was keeping it under control and I was actually sleeping pretty well I developed epilepsy. My focal seizures have been terrible the last few days and I think it's going to lead to a grand mal soon.Even the night I had my grand mal the first time I couldn't sleep after. Just good old "won't happen" when it comes to falling asleep.
NotSignal	this quarantine messed me up big time, i don't go to sleep till 6,7 or sometimes 8. i have to go to work at 8 today and iv'e slept 4 hours but i woke up every 2 and forced myself to go back to sleep. i kept trying but i cant fall asleep anymore.... any tips?
Signal	Currently I can't get more than 5-6 nights sleep a week, either I don't sleep/get two hours because I have something to do and the time my body want's to sleep is mid way through lecture's etc. Sometimes I take a few days of university so that my bedtime gets later (so I fall asleep like this; 2am,5am,8am,11am,2pm,5pm) I feel okay but it's not practical.If there are any drug suggestions bare in mind I've tried: Very strong non opiate pain killers, melatonin, anti depressants, the strongest antihistamines and a sleeping pill called amitriptyline.The only direct question I have is, does anyone have any advice for getting into polyphasic sleeping? Once I'm asleep it's hard to wake up sometimes and I'm curious if anybody's found it helped there poor sleep?Any tips or advice would be much appreciated, I used to get one or two a week and I'm really missing those days now.P.S. Sorry for the long post, I feel like sleep is a very complex subject and people's definition of insomnia varies massively. Going to sleep at 2 am is a bad habit imo but for some people that's enough to cause issues.
NotSignal	I wanted to make a poll but apparently that's not allowed :(. Anyway, here are my options:1. Exercise during the day. 2. Winding down/Relaxing before going to bed/Sleep music3. No devices before going to bed4. Fixed sleep schedule5. Healthy food/No stimulants6. Meditation during the dayI can't think of anything else rn but comment what method you've found best. Personally, I use sleep music/listen to a podcast but it doesn't work all the time.
NotSignal	I have a big problem, I was so tired today that i started having a headache so i decides to try to sleep. I lay in bad and when i am dozing off and feeling like entering a dream state my mind just rejects it and it feels like all that sleepy dozing off sensation disapears. It happened 3 times today until I decided to give up. And it only happens during the daytime.Unfortunate it's hard for me to go see a neurologist in this period so I am curios if anyone had the same problem and what exactly happens.
Signal	Is there something slightly more potent (not an antihistamine) that isn’t as “intense” as something like ambient or lunesta? The melatonin would work for me, but it always makes me vomit and have severe nausea. Just wondering if there’s something that’s a step up, but not a serious med if that makes sense. And melatonin makes me tired the next day.
Signal	My experience with sleep has been declining over the years. Back around five years ago, I could easily sleep 8 hours and feel prepared for the day, now, I can't sleep but four or five at a time. I have to force myself to go to sleep and even when I do I wake up in cold sweat and have an odd, looming hazy feeling. When I lay down I don't relax and think nice things, I'm stressed because I can't complete my assignments because I just don't have the cognition anymore. I used to love playing video games but now I can't stand more than an hour of them at a time. Is this something else or is it some kind of match made in hell between depression and insomnia? Are there any otc or prescription drugs that help with sleep? Thank you and goodbye
Signal	Any advice for how to push through? Sleep deprivation hits me HARD - I’m talking chest pain, dizziness, high blood pressure, sensitivity to light, headache, can’t think, etc.It’s so hard to push through a day and be productive when I feel this awful. It’s impossible for me to nap (my body stopped being able to nap when my insomnia hit), so really all I can do is lay in a dark room and meditate in misery.However, because I’m sleep deprived multiple days a week, I can’t just lay in bed on these days AND maintain a normal life. Any tips for fighting through the pain?
Signal	This may be a stupid question and have already been answered so I apologise in advance if that’s the case - is depression induced insomnia corrected through anti depressants? I know a friend who’s on Prozac and is now suffering from insomnia after having taken it. Prior to it she slept well even though she was depressed. I suffer horrifically from insomnia brought on by my depression and anxiety but don’t want to make it worse by getting on antidepressants
Signal	Wondering if anyone has successfully used Mirtazapine to combat their insomnia long term without any notable tolerance/side effects? If so how bad was your insomnia prior and how are you sleeping these days?
NotSignal	We fell asleep in one world, and woke up in another.Suddenly Disney is out of magic,Paris is no longer romantic,New York doesn't stand up anymore,the Chinese wall is no longer a fortress, and Mecca is empty.Hugs & kisses suddenly become weapons, and not visiting parents & friends becomes an act of love.Suddenly you realise that power, beauty & money are worthless, and can't get you the oxygen you're fighting for.The world continues its life and it is beautiful. It only puts humans in cages. I think it's sending us a message:"You are not necessary. The air, earth, water and sky without you are fine. When you come back, remember that you are my guests. Not my masters."
NotSignal	I was using apple cider vinegar putting a couple tablespoons in a glass of water to drink. I heard it's good for detoxing your body and weight loss. As well I applied some to my face and to moles as it has been shown to remove moles and black heads. It also can diminish scars and wrinkles (if not remove them completely). And it can tighten the skin closing large pores.I'm posting this here because I notice it makes me very tired by the end of the day. I sleep really well after using it. Perhaps it could be used to treat insomnia?
Signal	This quarantine stuff has thrown my sleep schedule in a downwards spiral. Like I would regularly sleep at 3am and wake up at 1pm when I had nothing to do but optional schoolwork (did none whatsoever and still graduated lol). However recently I've been forced to be productive and had to be ready to work at around 12pm. This wouldn't be a problem right? Just sleep at 1am and wake up at 11am and it's all good right? No apparently my brain thinks that sleeping at 1am when I have stuff to do the next day is a perfectly good cause for anxiety and thus no sleep, even tho I still would get like 10 hours of sleep. Anyway this has been going on for like 3 weeks and it's gotten old FAST. Like I'd sleep every other night, and the nights I do sleep it's from 6am to 10am. My body literally won't let me sleep until it sees the sunrise then it goes, "oh yeah sleep that's what I need" and I just crash for 4 hours. On the other days I just don't sleep at all. However one day I was so tired I went to bed at 10pm and slept for 11 fucking hours. For the first time in 3 weeks I actually slept like normal. I tried this again the next night and got 8 hours. Well tonight I was busy and couldn't sleep til 12:40 and sure enough I'm up at 2am on reddit. What the fuck is going on and is anyone else experiencing this?TL;DR if I go to bed at 10pm and I sleep fine, go to bed at 1am and I get anxious and can't sleep.
Signal	I really need to raise my biology grade and this insomnia thing is not helping. I don't think I will sleep tonight, I already have trouble sleeping in normal nights let alone when I am this anxious. I am going to try to meditate for a few hours if I can.What do you do to focus when you're sleep deprived?? The exam is at 12 pm :/
Signal	I normally take an Ativan to help me sleep at night. It relaxes me and I like the dreams it gives me. I’ve been on it a really long time and my doctor isn’t liking the fact I’m using it as a sleep aid so she prescribe me Lunesta (3mg). The only other sleep aid I’ve been on is trazodone which I hated cuz it just felt like a weighted blanket to me.So what is Lunesta like? I’m really hesitant to give it a try because I like my bizzaro dreams I currently have.
Signal	I have been prescribed trazdone (50-100mg / night) for over a year. Trazdone is a old school antidepressant than has a sedative effects. It's used off label for insomnia. I feel mentally dependant (like I feel like if I don't take it, I fear I won't sleep at all). Technically there is very low / no dependancy with trazdone itself. I've been self quarantined, my work is shutdown #unessentialI've been thinking, I could use this time to retrain my brain to sleep naturally, as I really really dislike taking the medication in general. It causes late night snacking(almost sleep eatting) and the morning grogginess sucks, even after over a year of use. I'm fine with a few days of no sleep, nothing else to do. Thoughts?
NotSignal	It is my birthday and it is 5:00am. I think I only slept about 2 hours and I still can't fall asleep. Am I the only one that gets this birthday insomnia? I am worried that I am going to be tired on my birthday now, and this is not how I wanted to feel...
NotSignal	Alternatively, how much sleep do you get per week on average? Im trying to gauge if I’m even an insomniac and if it’s bad enough to do something about. But if this is just how adult life goes (i’m 24) I don’t want to waste my time and money.Also I like data
NotSignal	Currently in a routine for the last 7-8 months of laying in bed for what seems like 6 eternities, becoming guilty about staying up, getting up and reading some papers until I have no choice but to either see the sun again and wither away just a tad more every day or my body to call it quits and fall asleep thankfully. Currently getting anxiety because I feel like I’m not getting enough recovery from exercise or anything.
NotSignal	Only to promptly wake up two hours later for no fucking reason.
Signal	I don’t think I can stand much more. They say it gets worse before better but I am dying. My quality of life is so bad right now because of this sleep deprivation therapy. I spend the whole day and evening fighting to stay awake and fighting headaches, pain and nausea from sleep deprivation. Then I go to bed at my usually scheduled time and cannot fall asleep. Even in spite of the fact that I couldn’t stay awake standing up just 30 mins ago. I am wide fucking awake. I can’t believe how bad it is. I can’t function like this. I have to be able to go to work. I’m a mess. I feel suicidal. How can I live like this? I’ve taken a sleeping pill (zopiclone) which I hate and am trying to get off of, but I need some respite. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like insomnia is going to cost me my job, my independence and my life.
NotSignal	Did anyone recently get really bad insomnia due to the quarantine? I haven’t slept well since the start of it, only getting about 2/3 hrs of sleep if I’m lucky.
Signal	I’ve had Insomnia for years now. Last year it got so bad I was having panic attacks before going to bed or when I couldn’t fall asleep. Fortunately, I managed to fix that and I rarely get them, but I still struggle with falling asleep and waking up multiple times per night. Recently, I’ve started to have nightmares and I’ve woken up crying multiple times. I’m just scared that if I keep getting nightmares, my panic attacks will come back.
Signal	Tried to post this in the anxiety subreddit but it wouldn't let me.Does anyone have any tips on night time anxiety? I keep waking up 3-4 times a night really thirsty, with a pounding heart and intrusive thoughts. I try really hard to get back to sleep and not go on my phone, but sometimes I end up just scrolling as a distraction and because I feel so awake. How can I let go of my thoughts and go back to sleep? Or how can I make sure I go to bed so calm that I won't wake up?Thank you!!
NotSignal	Here are some unconventional things that I've read or experienced that can help with insomnia:- smoking MJ. For some (read that again...some!!!) People it helps quiet the brain and relaxes you. I do know, and understand, that not everyone can smoke or has the availability to do so. - have a drink or two. Again for some it can help the body relax and such, but for some it might not have that desired effect.- have an orgasm. You do not need another partner to get off and be able to go to bed. I know everyone hears of a guy that has to "rub one out" before bed. This isnt just limited to men ladies!!!! Self pleasure is sometimes the best pleasure. You know your body. You know what feels good. But if you have tried that and it doesnt work. Change it up! Get some toys, try a lube that has cooling/warming/whatever effects to it. Try in a different position, or location (i.e. a warm shower, etc). Especially with the current times and social distancing, you are the main person that can activate your pleasure center. Having an orgasm releases so many feel good chemical reactions in your body. For some (asexual, etc) this might not be an option either and I'm sorry. These are just some ideas to try and help others who suffer from insomnia like I do. Love yourself 🖤
Signal	What do you guys do when you know you’re not gonna sleep tonite to be somewhat ok the next day?I had insomnia way worse when my job was mentally exhausting, but now my job is physically exhausting and I’m not really sure what to expect.
NotSignal	Hello all anyone know of a medication that helps with severe insomnia that dowsnt leave you extremely groggy the next day??Mt boyfriend wakes up at 1-2 am every morning and cant go back to sleep at all its effecting his work
NotSignal	Idk why this is happening but it started 2 years ago and it’s been really difficulty to deal with. I can sometimes fallback asleep if I drink a glass of water and sometimes I can’t. And most of the time I can fall back asleep if I eat some food that fills me up ( but I’m too freaking tired to cook ). I try napping but I find it difficult to fall asleep during my naps.So what is my problem ? I usually eat at 1-2pm then 2nd meal at 7-8pm and that’s it, i fast the rest of the day.
NotSignal	Pretty sure I caught the flu early March. And I have been wired ever since. This is pretty odd because I am usually fatigued due to other health issues. But it's been kinda nice? Other than my eyes and head.. they hurt.
NotSignal	If it did work, where did you find your therapist? I'm unable to find one via my insurance. My sleep has been getting worse and I really want to fix it :(
NotSignal	Figured out, even though im tired af but not sleepy at all, i can just do more work. I'm pretty bored and i don't actually enjoy watching shows/movies or reading books/comics/manga anymore. I cant play music cause i left my instrument at another place. It usually takes me 1-6 hours to fall asleep which is a huge amount of time wasted everyday with my eyes closed, no sound and my only thought being " sleep.. you should have gone to sleep an hour ago.. two hours.. three.. dammit! why am i not sleeping?". I do enjoy working, so i guess I'll stick to that for now. I know this isnt the most common post you'll see on here but oh well. Its a weird rant, but not really? I promise you i'm not drunk or intoxicated at the moment, but just really bored of the same old routine.Hope you guys are having a good night, maybe even chuckled a bit after reading this complete trash/masterpiece i wrote, but i suppose whoever is reading this is probably struggling to sleep at the moment soo.. F's.
NotSignal	Like what are the rules of cbt. All I can find are links saying it’s good or success or whatever but what actually is cbt. What do I do.
NotSignal	I don’t know where to go from here. I feel like I’ve tried everything and nothing ever works. I’m so depressed and tired all the fucking time.
NotSignal	Hi,I work in night shift and due to covid lockdowns I have to work from home. My work schedule is not fixed for every night therefore I sometimes logout at 3AM, 4AM or 5:30AM. During the last few hours of work I try to study/reaearch for further studies or personal knowledge as there is very less volume of work. Right after my shift ends, I continue the research/study and after that I go to sleep.There are two scenarios now:1) I used to sleep around 5 or 5:40AM but idk how I always woke up at 8-8:30AM and then I couldn’t sleep the entire morning, I used to force myself to sleep around 2-3PM but shortly after 3 hours I had to login work for next day and it would give me headache all night. I thought this was because I would get hungry, So.2) I tried to change the routine and started sleeping at 8:30-9AM but now I get disturbed by tons of things and again wake up by 1PM after this I cannot sleep till 5 and then I have work again.This is happening for 2 weeks now and for the past 3-4 days I have severe headache, this much headache that if I stand up from desk and look up I cannot, because of the pain I have to look down and bend a little Idk whyy.Please advice.Appreciated.
Signal	Im 16 years old but this started when I was ten. Please don't tell me "it's not real, its just school stress." I have experienced it everyday. I have had a MAX of 0-1 hours of homework a day, my average is 90% and not stressed ever. I also have it during all the breaks, and even right now. If anything, my condition is even worse when I don't have school.My mom has insomnia and my dad has apnea, so I know it's real. I'm physically unable to stay up past 1am, because my body shuts down. But I just lay there lifeless in my bed unable to sleep. I only sleep in 3 hour blocks max. My night usually goes like this: go to bed at 11:30. Fall asleep at 3am. Wake up at 6am, fall back asleep. Wake up at 9am and feel like shit, so i either get up or go back and wake up at 11 just for 8 hours total.I'm Canadian so based on life expectancy i'll have to live like this for 75+ years in total. Melatonin does nothing to help me fall asleep, and just makes me drowsy during the day so it's worse than doing nothing. Drugs do knock me out after like 3 hours but they keep me out for 12, and I can't live like that.
Signal	Sorry this a little long and mainly just venting.My insomnia journey started after I had to stop taking Gabapentin after becoming pregnant. I guess you could say I had some sleep issues before due to lifelong anxiety issues, but at least before I had no problem falling asleep. I would wake up sometimes during the night and not be able to go back to sleep for a couple of hours due to anxiety about problems or having to do something the next day. My psychiatrist put me on Gabapentin 600-900mg a day to help with everyday anxiety and a more restful sleep. After I had to stop Gabapentin, my life went to hell. It's like my brain forgot how to fall asleep no matter what I tried. After weeks of this and feeling suicidal, I finally got into a routine with unisom that helped me fall asleep. Six months after having the baby, I am back to not being able to fall asleep. I think it was partly triggered to life transitioning back to "normal" after quarantining. Now when I try to sleep, my heart starts beating fast and my stomach starts flip-flopping. Once I get past the point of no return I usually can't fall asleep until 3-4 am. I have three kids so I can't sleep in either. Unisom no longer helps. I feel sleepy and groggy but the switch in my brain won't turn off.A few days ago I had a video appointment with a nurse practitioner (I was going to see a psychiatrist but apparently he's booked far out). She put me on 25-50 hydroxyzine to take before bed. I was pissed when I realized afterwards that this was just another antihistamine like Unisom but I figured I would try it. Of course it doesn't work and has the same effect as Unisom. I told her I get very depressed and suicidal when I can't sleep and this is what she puts me on. I'm thinking about just drinking some alcohol before bed and see what happens. Is this a bad idea? I need something to relax my mind.
NotSignal	So basically for the past few days I haven't been able to sleep. Some nights maybe I do sleep, I can't really tell. Weird, I know, how would you not know if you slept or not, I don't know either. But if I did sleep, it must have taken me a SUPER long time because of this weird thing happening to me, it's sort of hard to explain but I'll try my best.So basically I'll be super tired right, and think to myself that I'll finally get a good night's sleep, but just when I'm on the verge of falling asleep (like the second I'm about to actually fall asleep) my brain's just like "nope, you're not tired" and I suddenly feel super awake, it doesn't take that long for me to be tired again though. It's like my brain is on strike or something. And sometimes after a while I just give up on sleeping and just go on my phone, even if I feel really tired.
Signal	I took ativan 1mg for six days straight for anxeity and sleep (hopefully I am not tolerant)... Any Alternatives? I have hydroxyzine (atarax) and my aunt has trazodone.
Signal	I feel so anxious about all of this. My insomnia was never this bad. My heart rate is so high, my thoughts don't stop, it seems like I'm dreaming but awake at the same time... All of this is scaring me so badly.
Signal	Do you ever lie in bed so long trying to sleep that you just get angry and punch your pillow? Not even the strongest edible can knock me out. And now I'm spiraling back into the bad place and I'm having the bad thoughts again and I just want to sleep.
Signal	I always thought as a kid that my non-sleeping or burst of energy at nights would eventually go away. Then college came and went... then graduate school... I now work a job that lets me make my own hours but it’s still hard. Who decided the world should be running from 8am-10pmish? I’d like to punch that person.
NotSignal	I took 10 mg one night and 15 mg the next without any improvement in my total sleep time. I’m going to try 20 mg in a few days but I’m curious what it’s been like for you
NotSignal	Hey,I hope that your sleep is getting better. I just wanted to ask in the group if anyone is interested in a free eBook bundle. It's over 263 pages. One eBook is about insomnia, second about stress management, third about anxiety, forth about meditation. Let me knowStay safeMatt
Signal	i now take zolpidem for insomnia. 10mg, which is more than i was supposed to have . i feel sooo funny & loopy. when i stand up i don’t walk straight & i’m hearing voices. i’m freaking out bc everything looks weird & i feel like people are trying totalk to me. i’m staring at my knees saying they aren’t mine. idk what’s happening to me. what do i do??
Signal	Sleeping has been a huge struggle of mine since I was little and my lack if sleep effects my life and mood in a big way, no motivation, no happiness, depression, etc. On my birthday I got really messed up, and it probably didnt help that at the time I was going 32 hours without sleep. And these past couple of days I've been up till 6-7am and wake up at 4-5pm
NotSignal	It’s 3am and I’m laying in bed listening to my wife breathe and my dog snore. Only 3 more hours of this until I get to get up 🙂
NotSignal	No. They're not dreams. They're memories. Most of my nightmares actually happened to me. C-PTSD is real. I'm afraid to sleep because I don't want to relive it again. I wake up in a panic several times a night. I've been in therapy for 4 years now but it seems to have gotten dramatically worse since the start of this year. The stress from all the change in my daily life has fucked my mental health. I had a routine that was working. Go to school everyday (even weekends), groceries twice a week, one night a week for socializing (I tend to self isolate), one day a week to visit family, and one day a week for an outting with my husband. One of my biggest triggers is being stuck in a house (due to being trapped in a house with an extremely abusive parent for 18 years). I stayed out all day everyday and I got better. But now, we can't do those things anymore. Fuck COVID and fuck the people who aren't following the rules and dragging this shit out. At this rate, I'll either be in the psych ward or six feet under by 2021.
NotSignal	Some advices falling asleep please? This happens to me every Sunday. I usually sleep about 5-6 hours a night and in weekends about 11 hours. Maybe I should start with changing that? xD
Signal	I had made a post about how I went a whole 8 hours of sleep every night for a week. Its now been a few more days and I haven't gotten any less than 7.5 hours. More importantly, I've stopped worrying about how much sleep I get or thinking about sleep at all. I tried everything from hypnotherapy, Benzos & ambien. A combination of CBT-I assisted via a coach in an app + lifestyle changes (working out) has changed my life. The biggest change has been educating myself about sleep and stopping all the various "sleep effort" rituals that I had trying to force my sleep. Now, I barely think about my sleep and even if I do wake up in the middle of the night, those stomach lurches and sweats of anxiety are absent. I truly feel like a new person!To the kind user that suggested CBT-I, thank you so much - you have truly changed my life. If I could beat my sleep problems, I'm confident all of you in this group have a solution out there.Talked to my doctor this morning and he's slowly going to taper me off some drugs I take during the day for my anxiety since my sleep is better.
NotSignal	How long does it take,approx, to recover from 6 week rly exhausting insomnia? i feel like i could get back on track slowly. Figured out that goin to bed later makes it 20x easier to fall asleep, relaxing teas, and walks help too. I felt rly dizzy after a month of bad sleep and i still do.. Hope it goes away soon..I had sleeping issues on and off back then maybe for 2-3 days but never this long and concerning -\_-Also: Is it ok to drink caffeine after such a long amount of bad/no sleep?&#x200B;Anybody had experience with this?
Signal	22(F) prescribed Trazodone for sleeping problems. The side effects scare me a bit; anyone have experience with taking it? Thanks in advance!
Signal	Hi there, I'm trying to wean off benzodiazepines, and I thought I would try melatonin again. In the past I have used melatonin for a period of time, and it worked. However, it stopped working after a few months. I couldn't fall asleep again.It has been quite some time and I have tried it again, it helps me to fall asleep initially at times but I am tossing and turning all night, waking several times and having vivid dreams/nightmares. I feel like absolute shit when I get up after having such a restless sleep. Does this happen to anyone else?
NotSignal	The heater in my house is super loud and keeps me up at night unless I use something to block out the sound. I have some basic earplugs I got from Walgreens and they do block out the sound but they hurt my ears enough to wake me up after a couple hours. So I switch between those and some noise cancelling headphones which hurt my ears in a different spot. So basically I wake up every couple hours to swap between them but the pain gets worse as the night goes on and eventually I can’t sleep at all. Are there any earplugs that really don’t hurt your ears? I tried a slim fit one from Walgreens and they were just as bad. Please help!
NotSignal	Both physically and cognitively I feel like a mashed potato.I’m so desperate for sleep I’m very tempted to try the “hit your head in a wall with the power of a thousand splendid suns” therapeutic procedure.
NotSignal	Ever thought you'd woken up from a nightmare, only to realise you're still in it? Realising only once you've woken up properly? Fuck me I'm so frustrated with my fucking nightmares! Go to sleep to get some rest, they said...Don't want too go back to sleep, too fucking uneasy and watchful of the walls to be awake.
NotSignal	Hello. I’m an 18 year old girl and I’m really having trouble with my sleep and could really use help. My sleep schedule right now is bed at 3-5am and waking up 11-2pm. I’ve had sleep problems for most of my life but lately have been extreme. Im like tired all the time, and then when it comes to the time I sleep, it’s a whole new feeling. My brains flooded with all kinds of random thoughts and ideas and daydreams, and they just keep coming. They don’t stop. Sometimes I can mentally like shut off, but it only lasts for like 30 seconds. This goes on for about 3-4 hours, as I’m just laying in bed with my eyes closed wide awake. It’s pure torture. I dread going to sleep at night and will just cry in my bed at like 4:45 in the morning. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Which is why I’m posting on here just to see if someone anywhere in the world can relate to me and help in any way. Thank you for reading. <3
Signal	My doc prescribed me Lunesta/Eszopiclone (2 or 3 mg) and he said I can take it for months.does anyone have experience taking this medicine for a long time? side effects? if you stop it, insomnia worsens or only returns to baseline?
Signal	I have been dealing with insomnia for my whole life. I would like to start by saying that I have already tried just about every over the counter medicine, prescription medicine, changed diet, routine, home remedies and nothing works. I've seen multiple doctors and nothing ever works. Currently I am taking Lunesta(I took it approx 4hrs ago and haven't so much as yawned). I love sleep. It is one of my favorite things to do. Typically I have very good, vivid/lucid dreams once I do fall asleep. I also have a fear that I am going to not wake up/die in my sleep. I've worked 12hr days, body completely exhausted, and then lay in bed for hours because I can't turn my brain off. I never know when I will fall asleep, and as I get older it has been getting more and more difficult to wake up. I set the loudest alarms(6-7 at a time) and will sleep right through them(probably due to not falling asleep until shortly before it goes off). It typically takes someone shaking me, or just naturally waking up on my own. This makes it extremely difficult to lead anything that would even resemble a normal life. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
Signal	So this is for the people who have to go to work in the mornings (5-9am)So it's nine o'clock and you know you have to get to bed soon.Ten o'clock hits and you start getting ready to go to bed,Eleven o'clock his and you're just laying there.Eleven thirty you trying to best to fall asleep.By twelve o'clock you're starting to get irritated because you are gonna have to wake up to go to work in some hours and you're mad cause it's late and you won't get enough sleep.One in the morning you are constantly checking your phone to see what time it is and your getting upset because you know you're gonna be exhausted.Once it hits two your thinking "well looks like am going to work on a no nighter"Three in the mourning you're mad as you can be and you are just about to start to get up because you can't sleep at all.You fall asleep randomly between three and four in the morning,(5am-9-5) you wake up. Tired as you can be and you have to push yourself to get out of mad. You're so tired and you look to see you have slept only a few hours.Then you get ready to go on with your day. Your tired all day and exhausted. All your think about is you really want to go to bed. And you really think that you're gonna fall asleep quick because you barely slept last night.You get back home and eat and all that.Then BAM your not tired anymore..It's already nine and you have so much energy. You get mad because all you wanted to do all day is sleep, but no, insomnia.the CYCLE repeats.
NotSignal	I tried to fall asleep last night and as I was about to I snored so loud I woke up. Also I get muscle twitches sometimes that prevent me from going to sleep. As a result I only slept for an hour. Has this happened to anyone here?
Signal	If you've seen any of my other posts you know my story and struggle with insomnia so far that just started about 4 months ago. I have tried every sleeping medication that you can think of and I got all kinds of tests ran (CBC, thyroid, etc). The only thing they found wrong with me was a positive ANA test but the results were so low it is likely a false positive- 1:40. (still getting it checked out though just in case). So I met this one girl who I kid you not was having the SAME exact symptoms as me online on a youtube video comments section about insomnia. (never feeling tired despite not sleeping and being completely unable to fall asleep) We started talking and we were shocked, we both had the exact same symptoms. The only difference is hers started after taking a steroid medication and cbd oil and mine started I'm pretty sure after taking a steroid medication from my dentist and smoking weed. I have a suspicion that maybe we both just had a bad reaction considering THC and CBD I've heard can mess with some people, although it is rare. This was a huge coincidence I literally was unable to find anyone who knew what I was talking about. She told me that she was able to fall asleep after taking l-theanine and GABA, so that's what I'm trying right now. Anyway, I know this sounds super weird I just thought it was crazy I found someone who had the EXACT SAME symptoms and story as me. We had even been going through it for the same amount of time and her sleeping problems started overnight as well. I'll try to keep updates on if the l-theanine and GABA works for me. I'm also going to be doing a podcast at 10:30 am central time on this guy's show named Daniel Erichsen. He does insomnia insight videos. Daniel Erichsen's youtube channel was oddly enough where we met eachother because he made a video covering her story and I could not believe the similarities! Anyway, this is crazy and I hope to talk to him, he seems like a great guy. Feel free to watch the podcast if you would like- my name is Grace and I will be on talking about everything going on.
NotSignal	People who don’t go through that sh** we do every night can’t understand how fuc**d up that situation is.You’re getting treated like you’re some kind of psychopath for making a drama out of a „natural“ thing. In my opinion it’s even worse than not being able to sleep. Anyone else same opinion?
NotSignal	Went to bed at 1:20 AM and next time I look at my phone thinking it will be like 2:30-3:00 AM, it’s actually 5am. The thing is that I don’t recall falling asleep and I don’t think I fell aslepp cause I can’t remember any dreams. Does it happen to you often?
Signal	I know very little about insomnia and I’m not technically diagnosed with it but I can’t fall asleep no matter how hard I try. My severe depression/anxiety is just causing my head to spin and I can’t wind down. Last night I slept 3 hours and at the moment it’s 5 AM and I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep at all. If I can’t sleep tomorrow night or the night after what will happen?
NotSignal	i'm guessing the answer is no, and it's something else instead. however, i did start staying up late because it was taking me 2 hours to go to sleep every nighti feel like i don't really need sleep to function, but i haven't gone to sleep before midnight in what seems like forever, so i don't have a lot to compare it toi know that, insomnia or not, it's still an issue, especially owing to the fact that i'm 14sorry if my problems seem trivial, or if this isn't really the right place to ask
NotSignal	Posted on r/sleep, posting here too. Throwaway due to nature of post.I'm female, mid twenties. So Friday night I was hanging out with a male friend. (We've been socially distant from everyone else and hooking up exclusively since before quarantine!) We did drink a couple beers as well as smoke some marijuana, though the effects had worn off (mostly) by the time we went to sleep. We also had sex during the evening, and ended up falling asleep around midnight.I woke up the next morning thinking that was it, though my friend was acting kind of strange. We went our separate ways, and later I texted him about it. He mentioned something about my actions being frustrating, and then said that he had been wondering if he had initiated it in any way...Turns out, throughout the night he would wake up to my hands grabbing all over him, which would turn into us having sex. He said this happened like five times (and he and I *do* sometimes have sex that many times in one day), and that each time he would fall asleep I would wake him. Eventually, he had to tell me bluntly to stop and that he needed to sleep.I don't remember any of this. I feel soreness that is consistent with having a *lot* of sex, and I 100% trust my friend, so I believe him completely. I asked him if I like appeared awake and he said that he thought so, but that it was dark and in the middle of the night and his memory isn't 100% clear of the situation now.I guess I was asleep? and initiating sex and having sex in my sleep? I have historically been a VERY heavy sleeper, like i have two alarms set because sometimes i turn off my alarms in my sleep, but I've never had anything like this happen before.Has anyone else dealt with this before?? A quick google tells me that its akin to sleepwalking, and is a "thing," but I wanted to reach out to this community to see if anyone had any insight. I'm kind of freaking out, and now I'm worried about sleeping in the same bed / near anyone because I'm afraid I'll try to have sex with them in my sleep. Thanks in advance for help.
Signal	Today is my birthday and I just turned 21 but that's besides the point! I'm a woman who had immense difficulty sleeping for about two weeks. On top of that, I felt incredibly depressed and wasn't motivated to do anything. The first week of depression/no sleep, I got so desperate, I called crisis lines and eventually admitted myself to a mental health hospital. Due to the irrational state of mind I was in, I didn't really participate in the group therapy and I tried to starve myself to death (seriously suicidal at the time). In addition to that, I also have BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder) and because of the lack of sleep, I look a little like corpse-bride. It was idiotic of me but I did NOTHING to improve myself while I was hospitalized due to the depressive state I was in. Instead of self-blaming and self-loathing, it's best to accept the bizarre situation and move forward. I'm now inspired to help others with mental health issues. It's unfortunate that I don't look as youthful as I used to be and I doubt men would find me attractive anymore. Oh well, c'est la vie. Also, I'm immune compromised and COVID-19 is still a thing. Omf lol. Note, mental illness is not anyone's fault. Sometimes it just happens and sometimes it takes over. Insomnia isn't anyone's fault either and same with depression. Although it can be difficult, highly recommend being kind to yourself and just doing what you can to improve yourself daily. It was stupid of me to not take the therapy but i was in a very irrational state of mind. I struggled with insomnia and internet addiction since I was 19. This completely changed my personality. Used to be loving, kind, hard-working, and very compassionate. Now, I am irritable, unmotivated, and lacking empathy. It sucks when you cannot feel. There's a HUGE part of me that wants to end my life but I'm only staying here because of my mom. I've struggled with suicidal ideation when I was 19. Guilt plagues me. Also lost most of my friends due to my BPD and BDD :( TL; DR: Struggled with insomnia since I was 19, didn't get sleep for 2 weeks straight recently and due to depression did not do anything to improve my situation. Was hospitalized but didn't do the group therapy. Lost many friendships due to other mental health issues. Feel suicidal.
Signal	I fell asleep at 6 am, woke up at 11(i go through it really badly). I feel like ivve beed doing drugs all my life and now i can't get sober. Like i'm in a fucking bubble and all the people who are near are just an illusion. Like i'm completely alone.I can't fucking cope with it. If i'll have another night like this i'll kill myself. I just want back into the real worldAnd it really fucks up my mind and i took up self-harming after 2 years being clean. Why the fuck i can't just sleep like a normal person
Signal	Hi so I had this shitty professor who graded me down based on his personal issues since he gives me no explanation, and that and plus other people like roommate or advisor who just get on my nerves and I can just feel their anger towards me in the form of jealousy Anyways this stuff keeps me awake at night. I really hate it when people are invasive with what I do with my life, why I make decisions, and if they are interested in my goals I just want to sleep and focus on the academic courses I’m taking now. I’ve been falling asleep at 2:30 and waking up from 10 am -12:30 am. I went it for New Years so it’s almost 5 am and I’ll probably wake up at 12 pm. How do I fix this sleep schedule and my anger accompanied by it. It’s really causes me anxiety, to the point I feel like I just want to scream especially if I’m near a lot of people in one room
NotSignal	If another person tells me all I need to do to get some sleep is exercise, I'm going to shit in my hand and throw it at them.I work as a personal trainer I know all about exercise, I also know it has done absolutely nothing to improve my sleep. People need to stop doling out t generic advice when people say they're suffering from insomnia.
Signal	Ok so my insomnia is worse than it was when it first started. I went to bed at 1am very sleepy and tired, I was sure I was going to fall asleep fast, but I was wide awake the second I went in my bed. I fell asleep at 6am. Its been like this for a couple of days. Now I can’t just sleep for the rest of the day because - I have an online lecture in 30 mins.- My parents who are not working during the quarentine would probably wake me up at 11 am yelling and tell me to to stop being lazy. I don’t know what do to I just want my normal sleep schedule back. More importantly, I want to get rid of insomnia.
NotSignal	So i've always been a light sleeper and recently i been getting sick of not being able to sleep some nights and others i sleep like a baby, or periods where i don't sleep for 5 days straight and one night i knock out. So i decided to look for some sleeping medication, came across night nurse, used it one night and i slept like a baby. however once it ran out i thought i need more of this, but its only meant to be used when you got the flu not for sleeping. So i then looked at the ingredient of the medication turns out Promethazine Hydrochloride is the drug i require (not the drink version that rapper seem to love) . i bought some and the recommended usage is 2 per night, it helped for a few days but now i've become tolerant to 2 and need more, i've gone up to 7 pill per night now to help me sleep. Then i realised this is possibility dangerous. So i'm wondering is it safe take these pills per night? what could be the long term side effects? how should i fix my sleeping troubles? Is there anyone who knows about medication and has any advice?
NotSignal	I don't have insomnia, but my boyfriend does. At first, I admit it, I didn't really see his problem as something too concerning and I just passively suggested to him to go to bed at the same time everyday and don't let himself take naps, just the normal things people say when they have 1 rough night. Turns out, he hasn't been sleeping more than 4 hours a night since childhood...he's currently 23. I'm massively worried about his health and if he's doing alright in there. On top of it, he gets really sad and even scared to go to bed because he knows he'll just lie there awake. I've done a lot of research...no alcohol, changing thinking patterns to not stress, doing some more exercise, but for some reason he won't listen to much of my advice? It honestly makes me a little angry that he won't do what I think will fix his problems, but ig he has valid excuses. He just can't stop drinking alcohol (because he thinks it helps him sleep even though I read to him research about how it impedes sleep quality) and the stress is something he can't control all the time and he's too tired to do any exercises with me. We don't live together and we are in a long-distance atm that's going to close in 2 months, but is there anything you guys suggest I do right now to help? Is there some attitude I should have when talking to him about his problems to make him more comfortable? I used to remind him to go to bed at midnight and texted him until he finished getting ready, but he recently asked me to stop because even though he got into bed at an early time it didn't lead to him sleeping. Is there any other system like that in which I can help that you think might work?Thank you for reading!
Signal	Been up since 1am and now its 7pm... its been like this for months for me. Its gotten better actually. 2 months ago I would’ve been up all night and slept all day everyday when my body finally gave out. I want to sleep its just my brain or body wont let me. I miss waking up in the morning. My body is out of whack from the 2-3 month hiatus of waking up at night and sleeping in the day.
NotSignal	For a few nights in a row now I keep waking up every two hours on the dot. Got to sleep at 9:30, wake up at 11:30, 1:30, 3:30, 5:30, and just stay awake after that. What gives? Does anyone else have this issue?
Signal	I know that this is the million dollar question, but I wondered if anyone has experienced similar things. My wife thinks that I am asleep, but I'm really just laying there. I know I'm conscious, but I'm still experiencing some dreams/hallucinations and my body feels very heavy. Nevertheless, when I get up I don't feel rested at all. Has anyone had a similar experience with this? And if so, what steps did you take to solve it?I've tried sleeping pills, malatonin, not napping during the day, exercise, etc. Thank you!
Signal	Just wanted to post an update of the progression of my insomnia. It has been 6 weeks when I suddenly came down with brain fog and disorientation and some neurological sensations in my body. The following day I noticed I had severe Insomnia, as in I would wake up 3 to 4 hours later feeling hot sometimes with night sweats (thankfully the sweats are gone for now). I would get alot of day time sleepiness in random times, usually when im helping my sister with hw lol. Anyways what followed was muscle aches, muscle spams (jerks during sleep and sometimes in the day), numbness around face, tingling sensations around hands and feet, stomach aches, consipation, loss of appetite etc. Now I cant seem to fall asleep or get sleepy at all. All the sleep i have been getting is always nonrestorative and in increments of 1-2 hours at most now. Im still waiting on seeing a neurologist and a physiatrist atm.It feels like hell, im not gonna lie. And many times I wish I can go back to being normal. I just wish I knew exactly what I have. Also need to schedule an appointment with sleep doctor.
Signal	I'm writing this at 3:30 am. I put on my playlist and started at my wall, disappointed again that I only slept for 3-4 hours, even while taking melatonin. All I want to do is just get a good night's sleep for once. It feels like I haven't had one of those since I was a kid. It's like I'm at the point of breaking. It's just so frustrating... I hate this so much.
NotSignal	Okay so I have two options here. I’m on suboxone and see my suboxone doctor on Tuesday and can easily ask her to prescribe sleeping pills AND/OR I could see a primary (haven’t seen one in years) and get maybe bloodwork done to find the underlying issue (can they still prescribe pills thoigh) regardless I’m desperate for some emergency sleeping pills.
NotSignal	I dont know what to do, I managed to get a job but it requires me to be up during the day when I’ve been sleeping most the day, and I don’t sleep at night. My sleep cycle is totally erratic and I don’t know how to fix it. My insomnia is 100% stress triggered so this isn’t helping…
Signal	I’m 22 and have had a completely backwards and screwed up sleeping schedule since I was 16. Some nights I don’t sleep for a single minute and even the next night after having no sleep at all. I won’t fall asleep easily. Other nights I fall asleep at 8pm and wake up at 2am. Sometimes I fall asleep at 9am and sleep the whole day until it’s dark outside again. It’s gone on forever, I’ve received counselling and medication and nothing helps long term.I’ve only had a handful of normal night sleeps in this entire 6 year span. It’s the main reason I dropped out of high school, and then college twice. It’s why I’m depressed. It’s why my social life sucks and why I can’t hold down a job. Does anyone have ANY little tips that might help me? Perhaps ones that aren’t mentioned commonly like “turn on night mode or don’t want TV before bed” etc? I’m sad everyday because of how it’s robbed me of my life for so long. My friends and family support me but they can’t truly understand and just get tired of me being tired. They want to see me do well and I’m just not. Thanks for hearing me out, I appreciate any responses.
NotSignal	After a couple all nighters, I finally fell asleep at around 1:30!! Felt amazing
Signal	**Summary**: I feel the need to talk about my experience with **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**. I have had insomnia for about 8 months (it's been hell) but now have been sleeping well with no aid for about 6 weeks after CBT therapy. Prior to trying it, I told myself I would make a post if it worked.**Disclaimer**:* Use this information to decide if you want to try CBT. There are books on how to do self-CBT but there's **A TON** of things that a Therapist or Psychiatrist will do better. Don't assume that I'm covering all the details.* I'm not done my therapy and there are quite a few practices we haven't even tried yet and there are problems that I still haven't resolved yet. I still have bad nights once in a while.* Everyone is different. Insomnia affects everyone differently and can be solved differently.* Your primary doctor/physician should be your first point of information regarding sleep and medication.* I’m writing this because I found that there is little information about CBT.* I’m not here for critique or to judge others. Insomnia just really really sucks and I thought it was ruining my life. (Or that's how I felt)## Quick description of my situation:* **My Insomnia**: Main issue for me is falling asleep rather than keeping asleep (there is really two different types). For 8 months, I either got zero sleep, or 3 hours at 7am when the sun was coming up. My brain just can’t turn off sometimes. I over think things a lot and it won’t turn off.* **Psychological Causes**: Depression and anxiety due to dissatisfaction at work, pathologizing sleep... I think. *I always felt that when I sleep well, I feel well. Or that a good day work had a direct correlation to how I slept the night before. Which is simply not true.** **Physical Causes**: Disrupted sleep due to loud neighbors, every other day I was changing houses by sleeping at my girlfriends, and due increased chemical dependence on drugs## My experience:So lately I have been seeing a CBT Sleep Specialist Psychiatrist. After my second or third appointment looking for more/different medication from my family doctor, he off-handily mentioned CBT as a highly successful alternative but didn’t push it very hard. Not sure if it was due to stigma with mental health or personal medical philosophy but we quickly moved on to the conversation of prescriptions and general sleep hygiene. Only on my 6th appointment, did I ask for a referral because I was starting ramp on my zoplicone dosage and felt that I needed to get serious about trying every option. I know medication works for a lot of people but I didn’t want to become dependent so early in life. After working at a pharmacy in the past, I saw people were dependent and it was scary when were out of stock and a customer was in desperate need of it for the very same night. So I asked for a referral and waited for my first appointment.So enough background... there are some valuable things I worked on with my Psychiatrist.1. Biggest and first thing was **breathing exercises**. And reducing heart rate. Like longer times breathing out. Shorting times breathing in. Practicing what ratio of time works best for me by using actual heart rate sensors. At home, I do it while watching a show before bed. If I start yawning, I take that as my queue to \~try to sleep\~. This is also useful for daily life when you're just stressed.2. Ultimately, **removing my need for the "perfect" night**. By the end, I should be able to sleep without everything being perfect. Like the space and noise around you.3. **Learning misconceptions** about basic sleep hygiene. A lot of the facts online apply to everyone differently. You got to learn what works for you.4. **Being comfortable with less**. Like a consistent 5*6 hours nights rather than on*and*off 8*9 hours every day. Also not fighting a bad night. Letting myself live within it. Doing some remote work if I am really awake and cut my losses when I need to.5. Learning **how I might be pathologizing sleep** is huge. Identifying why I feel the need to control my sleep. What are my fears.... What are my misconceptions? And asking myself if people can really tell when I'm tired and grumpy.6. A **general analysis to understand why I am stressed**. Similar to pathologizing things but instead focusing on constructive ways of dealing with my problems. Essentially, if you are happier with life, you might sleep better.7. Fully committing to be okay with a **lot of shitty nights** before it gets better. Especially if you are at risk of rebound insomnia from getting off drugs.8. Taking coffee only between 10 am and 11:30 am. Or between 1:30pm and 3:00pm. Look online about **matching your cortisol levels with coffee**.* NB: I actually like my Psychiatrist. Which is probably really important. I feel like I could easily cringe if I didn’t like them.## CBT Therapy info:* It was about a month between being referred and the first appointment.* We talk for about 1.5-2 hours every 2-3 weeks* Cost Upfront: $150-180* My insurance: Covered \~70%(Only for psychiatrists not therapists). I understand it’s not suitable for everyone.## Things that helped me outside of CBT:* **Taking a break from sleeping is huge!** It might sound confusing, but it’s just like when you are stuck on a problem at work or school. If you are restless, get up and read a book, play a simple game. Try sleeping again later. The longer time you spend waiting to fall asleep. The longer you're dragging on the process of staying up. * **Don’t look at the clock if you can**. I used a Kasia smart plug to turn on a low\*light lamp at 1:30 to remind me that I've been waiting too long. If I fall asleep early, I don’t notice it anyway. * \*\*Reverse psychology.\*\*Plan stuff to do like shaving your face or folding clothes. Eventually you don't bother getting up do it anyway because your brain will want to do the opposite and you'll feel tired.* **Journaling** good and bad nights, and days when I decided to medicate (+dosage) helped a ton. * Losing memory from lack of sleep really sucked. It helped me feel a little more in control and track my progress. * It was good for finding triggers that caused my insomnia too. * It was also useful when talking to my family doctor about getting prescriptions (gives on objective view)* **Not giving a shit about blue light.** * There are so many factors to consider. Watching a to show or playing Skyrim at 2am relaxes me way more than the downside of blue light on my brain.* **Making a plan during the day**, and sticking to it during the night to avoid emotionally driven decisions. Making fear based decisions causes habits and addictions.* **Trying only one solution every two weeks.** Dont complicate your results with multiple things going on at once. Like don't try weed and sleeping pills at the same time.* Working out and eating healthy* After my bad days: Lots of sugar, electrolytes, and water. Gravol helps with feeling dizzy and nauseous during the day.## Things I tried but didn't help me in the long term:* **Melatonin**: If I did sleep with it, it was quality sleep, but didnt really regulate my circadian rhythm. Its also not super recommended by people in health care.* **Phenibut**: Low dosage was good for once a week to catch up on sleep but its fairly addictive. You get awesome dreams on it I must admit.* **Prescribed Indica Weed** was amazing at first because I didnt feel hazy the next day compared to Zoplicone but tolerance built after two weeks of continual use. Soon I was up all night wondering why it wasnt working.* **Zolpidem** had no effect at all even after doubling my dosage* **3.75mg Zoplicone** was my main drug of choice and was able to use it for 7 months without exceeding three days a week (as recommended)* **Having strict bedtimes**. I saw online it was good sleep hygeine to be consistent. This is true for the average person but I was so far gone that it was just another stress to worry about.
Signal	For context, I've never had problems with my sleeping until the beginning of 2020, where I went through a month of severe panic attacks / nocturnal panic attacks (maybe? not sure) in which my anxiety plagued me literally 24/7. It started as health related anxiety; I had a random bout of heart palpitations one night, which convinced me that I had a heart issue and caused a trip to the ER. Of course, as a 21 year old female, the doctors found nothing wrong with my heart and sent me home. Afterwards started the worst month of my life, full of panic attacks (which I thought were heart attacks); these got so bad that, at night, I would have bouts of sleep paralysis for HOURS. I would be completely unable to move immediately after just dozing off, and at the worst point, I would not be able to breathe during the paralysis. This bad night was right before my doctor's appointment. My doctor explained to me that at my age and weight (healthy weight), sleep apnea would be unlikely, and she also did a full heart workup to ease my sake of mind. She said it was likely anxiety-induced problems. She gave me some Hydroxyzine Pam for my anxiety and sleeping problems (at that point, I had not slept in five days and was hysterical) and it WORKED IMMEDIATELY! I fell asleep perfectly fine the next day. I think the knowledge that I had medication that could possibly cure my problems eased my anxiety enough to where it helped. I was sleeping fine every night for a month, easily after taking a pill, and it even carried on for two months-ish after the pills ran out. I convinced myself that because the sleeping problems were probably anxiety-induced, I could calm myself down and sleep, as nothing was actually physically wrong with me. My months of easy sleep after the pills ran out also convinced me to cancel my sleep study (such a dumb mistake). Now, the horrible problem is back. It came out of nowhere! I haven't even been stressed out...how is this possible? Can anxiety come out of nowhere? I've just put in a refill on my pills because I laid in bed for five hours and couldn't fall asleep for the 2nd night in a row. I have given up on sleeping for tonight. This is because right when I am drifting off, my body will receive what feels like a shock (not a hypnic jerk; it does not feel like I am falling), but more like a slight panicked sensation. I will then suddenly suck in air like I have forgotten how to breathe. It happens EVERY SINGLE TIME I DRIFT OFF...FOR HOURS. What is happening to me? Has this happening to any of you guys? Is this normal anxiety-induced insomnia? I have very bad anxiety about falling asleep now, as I am scared that it is something physical (like brain problems causing me to be unable to sleep) and not just anxiety. However, I am self-aware and know that the 'anxiety-cycle' is me having these weird sleeping problems, becoming anxious that something is wrong physically, and then the problem getting worse because of said anxiety and not an actual physical problem. The prospect that it could be neurological just scares to shit out of me and gives me, you guessed it...more anxiety and worse sleep! I am rescheduling a sleep study, also, and actually going through with it this time. In the meantime, I just wanted to ask for any advice and see if any people have been through something similar where they drift off and have a panicked feeling, stop breathing and gasp awake, or this weird trance-state I go into right when I drift off where I am awake and feel so cloudy-minded and like I am disassociating from my body (only way I can describe it). Is this anxiety causing a fear to sleep?? A series of nocturnal panic attacks? Insomnia caused by anxiety? Panic disorder? Please help!!!
NotSignal	for me it’s OCD and a bit of ADHDmy mind just never shuts off it’s hell also got trauma which plays in my head just wanna know what is keeping you guys up
NotSignal	I was supposed to be on a long awaited trip today. I couldn't sleep at all tonight. My mind was going over and over on what was going to happen on the trip, plus I was supposed to be only one there driving which gives me anxiety. Plus I made a mistake of reading too much about 9/11 lately and that also kept me awake. At 8 AM I already felt like I was drunk and I had to call the trip off. I've wasted all day, not being able to do anything productive. My house is a mess. It's 7 PM and I am already anxious I won't be able to sleep today.
Signal	Hey guys. I started off doing mindfulness etc to fix my sleep and was in bed 8 hours and sleeping 5.5. With once in a while a sleepless night. This approach didn’t seem to be getting me on track very quickly, and I seem to be bouncing around a lot emotionally. I decided to incorporate sleep restriction. I gave myself a 6 hour and 45 min window for a week and my sleep stayed around 5 hours. This calls for dropping my sleep window obviously. So I am now giving myself a 6 hour window this week and last night now my sleep dropped to 2.5 hours. It seems the anxiety of knowing I have such a small window is fueling horrible sleep onset insomnia. And squeezing my sleep to less and and less. I used to go to bed a bit more relaxed knowing I have a buffer zone to fall asleep. It feels like SRT is creating more anxiety for me. I go to bed now extremely stressed feeling like it’s a race, and if it’s not immediate lights out, I’m screwed. Is this normal? Should I drop the whole SR thing?
NotSignal	Naturally I fall asleep around 12-2 am. Last night I slept over 10 hours. When my schedule is clear I rarely have insomnia, and a lot of times I can just make myself nap if I want. But when I have to wake up before noon for anything even as small as meeting someone for lunch, boom insomnia. Often it happens when I put myself into bed before midnight. My insomnia just kicked off this year especially with the pandemic and events surrounding that in my personal life. This is really difficult for work especially with my manufacturing job being pretty rigorous. I don’t have many hours there and the 1 day I was needed this week I didn’t sleep but I made it out the door and then decided to call out because I realized I felt so awful and couldn’t take a 10 hr shift. But I can’t just call out every time I don’t sleep yet I honestly suffer on anything less than 7 hrs of sleep (not that I ever get close to that these days but that’s just how my body is). I’m starting a new job this morning and I’m stressed yet excited for it, and here I am at 4:30 am I guess. It’s gonna be a weird day. I hope I stay awake for it, I can survive 1 all nighter but this isn’t sustainable. It’ll also be mostly night shift so there goes any hope of a sleep schedule. With my current lifestyle, serious meds will be problematic and I don’t even want to take them anyways. I guess I’ll go back to using melatonin, because emotionally draining nightmares is better than no sleep :). I love insomnia. Hope I figure out something thank you for coming to my ted talk.
NotSignal	It’s been a week and half of restless nights for me. I usually get 2-5 hours of interrupted sleep; the most I got recently was 6 hours. Now I know it’s extremely rare but with each day of sleep deprivation I become more and more anxious and believe it’s a possibility that I have fatal familial insomnia, even though it doesn’t run in my family...
Signal	Hi! Lifelong insomniac here. Had issues sleeping since a small seizure when I was two. I’m also ADHD, Depression/Anxiety, EDS (hypermobile joints), and some sort of Mood Disorder Current medications: birth control, Adderall IR 35mgMy doc just sent a prescription for 1mg Lunesta. I have tried many other sleep medications but never anything like Lunesta or Ambien because I used to sleep walk. Any advice? I’m a 5’ 22 year old female. Has this helped for anyone else with similar issues as me?
NotSignal	I (24M) have been struggling with sleep ever since I started university three years ago. Each year it has progressively gotten worst. I'm now in my last year and I feel drained every day. The lack of sleep has caused me to miss classes and has stopped me from playing sports and going to the gym. I eat less food and I'm starting to drink less water each day. It's just pure torture going through this. I'll get less than 3 hours or no sleep at all. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. It's a soul draining experience you don't feel refreshed for each day. I am now looking into getting help from a sleep doctor probably for insomnia. What can I expect from a sleep doctor?And are there any students with similar experiences?
NotSignal	I was wondering if someone experiences this... my insomnia comes and goes, I have fantastic nights and terrible ones too, I never know unless... when I go to bed and I start feeling this static feeling I would describe as electricity in my body, I know for sure I’m gonna have trouble falling asleep and/or staying asleep.Anyone else has it?
NotSignal	I have this happen to me whenever I take short naps... not just recently but for quite some time now. Is anxiety basically the root of it? It's like it motivates me to stop sleeping or napping, get up and do something lol.
NotSignal	So a reason for some of my sleep troubles is my sleep position. I’ve been sleeping on my stomach for as long as I can remember however I’ve learned that sleeping on your back is better for you so I’ve been trying to do so but I’m having a hard time transitioning. Any advice
Signal	For the past three nights, I didn't sleep at all. Funny thing is, the last time this happened was like a year ago. I have nothing to stress about (online school isn't BAD and I'm talking to my friends), but I can't seem to pinpoint what's the problem. I'm such a wreck, all jittery and dizzy. I even drank warm milk (which gives me nausea), but it didn't work. I admit, I haven't taken a walk outside for weeks, but I've been eating healthy and maintaining a schedule. I cried a lot, and I had a huge migraine the days before. I am a high schooler, so what would happen when I'm older? Does this shit even happen this young?&#x200B;What should I do?
Signal	[F 25 US] I already felt severely depressed all of yesterday. To the point where I was finding myself terrified of my own mind. I didn’t trust myself. By 9pm I was truly scared and contemplated whether or not I should bring myself to the hospital. But as someone who has attempted suicide and gone to the hospital multiple times, I knew that I would be better off waiting it out, just have to get through the night, ya know? Now it’s 5am and that terror is growing again. I don’t know what the fuck I’m going to do. I can’t keep living off of barely any sleep. I can’t do it. My mind is already struggling with its own imbalances and life situations - I simply do not know if I have the mental capacity to handle this sleep deprivation stress on top of everything else. I feel so hopeless. Panic panic panic. :(((((((
NotSignal	The thought of not sleeping is what keeping me awake ..and im soo frustrated about it ....all the time ...i cant even sleep well in the day..damm it ..dont know..its been like weeks since i slept well .
Signal	It does take me a bit long before I fall sleep but I've never laid in bed awake without changing position for an hour. although I don't look at the clock when I'm trying to sleep because it makes it harder and I'd be pissed that I'll not have enough sleep but it never felt like an hour or more laying in bed. Mostly I just get lost in thoughts and forget to close my eyes.My biggest doubt about having insomnia is that maybe it's because I'm always doing something. I sleep at about 2 or 3 am almost every night. and I think maybe if I go to bed earlier I'll sleep but I don't feel sleepy enough earlier. and because it didn't work for me many years before; I haven't tried to sleep when I'm not sleepy in a long time. in fact it seems like I can't bring myself to do it. in conclusion, I stay up spending time on my phone or doing things I should've done earlier and I will wake up before 11 or 12 in the morning, no matter how late I slept. is this insomnia or I just have a bad sleep schedule and need to try harder?
NotSignal	I am absolutely out of my mind right now😊😊😊I Love Insomnia Haha!!! Literally being driven to tears because of Insomnia!!! Yep!!!
Signal	About 2 months ago I was only, maybe, getting 3 hours of sleep a night. My anxiety was SO bad that falling asleep was causing my body to panic and wake up every time I drifted off. It felt to me like I was dying every time I stated sleeping. It was a terrifying feeling and my body would go into panic mode. I have NO idea why I was feeling this way, as it’s never happened before. Has anyone ever experienced or heard of this before? Why would your body go into a complete panic if you started drifting off? I was VERY stressed at the time. For most of February my sleep went back to normal but all of a sudden the insomnia is coming back and I feel like this sleep anxiety is coming back again.
Signal	I wake up and I feel like I’ve already lived a whole life time lol. I’m exhausted. Trying slowly to come off temazepam and tonight’s night of sleep was awful. I think I woke up 40 times. Here’s to hoping tomorrow will be better.
NotSignal	Elo, It has been two weeks but I can't seem to sleep at night. I kept being aware of my surrounding. I tried the navy sleep technique thing, I tried a hot shower before bedtime, not using a computer past afternoon but nothing seems to help at all.
NotSignal	does the body adapt to sleep deprivation? sometimes i don’t sleep for a week and my body works normal like he does not give a shit
NotSignal	So I had really bad insomnia like my whole life up until a year ago and now with all this it’s really bad again, like full force. I have no clue how to get myself back on track. Ik it’s kind of like the blind leading the blind but anyone know of any way to get back on track?
NotSignal	Another sleepless night, next to my husband who falls asleep within 5 minutes and stays asleep all night. He doesn't know how lucky he is. Every time I start to doze off my mind jerks itself awake. As if falling asleep is dangerous and I have to stay awake. I don't have night terrors. I'm a lucid dreamer so I enjoy my dreams and "have fun" in them. Why won't you let me sleep brain....ugh....
NotSignal	Sorry if thats dumb im a night owl and prefer my alone time at night. I really wanna wake up earlier..
Signal	I was diagnosed with insomnia in my younger years and after having bad experiences with melatonin, I've not touched it for the last 4 years, simply choosing to put up with my Insomnia.Getting used to the painful cycle of falling asleep at around 10:00AM and waking up at any time before 1PM hasn't been easy, with it resulting in me having to go without sleep on certain days.This recently led to my fiancée giving me Diphenhydramine tablets, asking I try them despite my protests (since any other medicine I've tried hasn't been as useful as melatonin)After taking 2 a night, I've been sleeping at a time I feel comfortable with and waking up refreshed, happier and healthier. My days feel far better thanks to them.Although the box advised I should take them for 2-4 weeks due to risk of specific side effects, I'm on my 8th week of usage and I find that when I try to sleep without them, the hours I sleep for are far less in comparison to when I slept without them before. If anyone has experience with Diphenhydramine tablets, is long-term usage safe? Because I feel if I was to experience the side effects (increased heartbeat, etc) I'd have felt them within these 8 weeks of usage I just need the reassurance these ain't doing anything to me and I can't see anything online that helps, so if anyone knows an answer to my question I'd appreciate it
Signal	Dear fellow insomniacs,I’ve been to the hospital (2nd time) a couple of weeks ago with heavy stress-induced insomnia. I have been given 100mg Traszodone, 15 Mirtazapine, 100 Quetiapine (plus 50mg retard) and 3.75mg Zopiclone. I know it is a lot of stuff and it scares me. But at least it put me to sleep instantly. I just could not keep my eyes open. Sleep lasted for about 4 hours, then I’d wake up and take 80mg Dominal & 3.75 Zopiclone, fell asleep again and felt fine the next morning. Yet since a couple of days the first dose, which put me to sleep so wonderfully, stopped working. I almost don’t feel a thing. I’m used to the effects of a medication wearing off longterm bur not after a couple of weeks?! Has anybody experienced this and what did they do? I think I can’t take any more Trazodone or Quetiapine... my doctor told me to tamper out Mirtazapine, which I started but I think it’s not helping clearly! He’s part of those psychs who think few nirtazapine works better, but I have adverse experience.My next appointment is on Thursday. I don’t know how to get there, because when my sleep gets thatvad again, I’ll start feeling suicidaland I can’t have that. I really can’t. Should I make do with as many Zopiclone as it takes till Thursday?Any answer is appreciated. Sorry for any mistakes, I’m German.Thanks a lot!!!!!Tinatic
Signal	I took ZzzQuil every night for a year, not realizing it was bad. I built up a tolerance to diphenhydramine (the main active chemical), and have just recently been informed that this was bad. i guess it causes dementia or something
Signal	No. Really. I'm diagnosed bipolar with a side of generalized anxiety disorder. Lack of sleep can trigger hypomania/mania in bipolar people. Fortunately, I've never gone full manic. I can usually tell when I'm on the verge of hypomania and can reset myself with a solid night's sleep, but the only thing that gives me a solid night's sleep is Xanax, which I don't want to take every night, but it feels like I don't have a choice. Melatonin does shit. Diphenhydramine does shit. My doctor prescribed me Seroquel way back when, but I couldn't regulate my body temperature and would overheat. Not an ideal situation. I'm at my fucking wit's end here and am just in this vicious circle of anxiety caused by lack of sleep and lack of sleep caused by anxiety, which I know you all know very well. I just wish it would stop.
Signal	Ever since school was let out, I've had a lot of trouble sleeping. At first it wasn't that big of a deal, but now I'm scared for my life. Recently I've been seeing things. I don't know if they are hallucinations, demons, shadow people, whatever they are they scare the living shit out of me. I can see them though the crack from my door. And sometimes from my window. It looks like a shadow, but I can tell its not a shadow. Sometimes they have eyes, but most of the time i can't see their faces. They peek over the door looking at me, looming over the door. Whenever I see one, my heart stops and then beats so hard It's like it's gonna come out. They terrify me. Can someone tell me how to get rid of them or to how to stop seeing them? Please, I need to stop seeing them.
Signal	When i was unemployed i slept like a baby. Generally could pass out from 11pm to 7am without waking up at all in the night.Now that i have a job again i'm back to my weird sleep schedule. I go to bed at a time that would give me 8 hours of sleep but i find myself sometimes waking up at 3am, sometimes later than that around 5am.If i wake up around 12am-3am i can usually get back to sleep, although it might take a bit of time. However when i wake up after 3am and before 5am it feels like it's impossible to get back to sleep. The instant i wake up, my mind is racing and i'm thinking about all kinds of stuff and lying there trying to sleep is futile so i get up and try to go about my work at an early hour... This sucks though because i generally feel like shit throughout the day if i wake up this early.I'm sure other people here have had similar issues. I'm generally kind of an anxious person so i'm sure anxiety has something to do with it. I've tried CBD supplements to help me sleep, didn't help... Has anyone found something that works?
NotSignal	I guess I’m starting to have lighter sleeps now. It literally felt like I wasn’t asleep and I woke up 1 hour later. I’m terrified.
NotSignal	But when I try describing it to parents, they don’t believe me and for some reason I’m not able to see my doctor
Signal	Honestly not sure what to post or why I'm even typing really,I'm 16 male from England, no clue why I told you that but enjoy that info. I've had insomnia for like 3-4 years and I've told my dad I struggle with sleeping so he got me some medicine to take and it had no effect it's really impacted my school work and I just feel like I'm crazy because I don't sleep and I've tried to talk to a few of my mates about it and they just make jokes it's so shit, what can I do or do I just have to live like this for ever?
Signal	Hello, this is my first post on Reddit so I'm not quite familiar with how to use it.&#x200B;For the past week and a half, I've been experiencing pretty extreme insomnia, which I think was originally caused by taxing my CNS from heavy lifting in the gym with not enough rest, paired with drinking. This originally caused my body to become extremely sore at night and unable to sleep, extra strength ibuprofen didn't do much. The first week I slept around 6-8 hours in the span of the total week, some nights 1-2 hours, other nights 30mins. Around the 4-5 day mark, I had built up some extreme anxiety around not being able to sleep and just an overall feeling of helplessness. On the 5th day, I had what felt like a panic attack that lasted the entire day, I couldn't eat food and I've never experienced anxiety to that degree before so I ended up going to the emergency but left shortly after being unable to wait 8-9 hours(Canadian healthcare). The last couple of days I slept 3-4 hours(30-45min periods) a night, in which I was relieved to be sleeping at all, at this point my pain from the gym has almost completely subsided after seeing an osteopath.&#x200B;I had a doctor's appointment through the phone today and they prescribed me with Lorazepam 0.5mg, I'm posting to ask if I should bother taking this? I'm extremely scared of withdrawal symptoms and my doctor prescribed me a dosage of 30 pills without informing me at all about how to use it or any information about the drug/my past mental health/withdrawal symptoms/or addiction. It was about a 30-second phone conversation and basically all the doctor told me is I won't be dependent on them at this dosage and amount. If someone could provide some insight about this drug and if they think it is worth taking it for my situation without talking to a psychiatrist first.&#x200B;About myself: 21M, 160lbs, 5'10. 600mg of ashwagandha daily to cope with stress. I've been dealing with minor depression and lack of motivation before this situation and have never been prescribed anything before.&#x200B;I appreciate all feedback, thank you.
Signal	Last time I had to fall asleep 4-5 times in one night, didn’t do much for me because during the day I felt very tired. Never had good sleep but the excessive interrupting started days ago, I wonder why? I even took caffeine pills (usually works for me) twice but it did nothing for my energy.Generally speaking I have anxiety and depression, but I felt like I was doing much better lately, besides that I never had such a consistent “waking up multiple times” problem, it was more of a “taking a long time to fall asleep” but I could do 6-8 hours decently.
Signal	So Recently my sleep schedule went from bad to awful, I’m trying so hard to fix it but I just can’t sleep. I’m not diagnosed with any sleeping disorders or given any prescription drugs regarding it, so I take drugstore melatonin 10mg. Although I’m taking about 5 a night sometimes and I’m not sure that’s healthy, still I’m unable to sleep, I’ve been awake for about a day now, just as I was starting to fix my issue too. Should I see if I have a sleep disorder of some kind or does this just happen?
Signal	Does anyone else have this problem? Every time I try a new sleeping pill or tea or anything it works fine the first time and maybe even a second time but after that is like I become immune to it. Like tonight I took this tea to help me sleep it worked already twice before so I thought I had found the one but then it just didn't work tonight and here I am not being able to sleep. It's frustrating
NotSignal	i just hooked up with a guy and he’s amazing and the sweetest person in the world but we were going to sleep and i said i should probably warn you i have terrible insomnia and he said ‘just come here. close your eyes and just stay here and you’ll be asleep in no time’ and he was so sweet about it i hate that it didn’t work. now he’s asleep and my restless leg syndrome and anxiety have spiked again. i asked him earlier how long it takes him to fall asleep and he said ‘5 seconds if i’m trying to go to sleep.’ i hate it here i wish i could just sleep
NotSignal	idk I always wondered about this, what are your thoughts and experiences about that? how it affects thought process and perception of reality? I hope I have or hundred characters now
Signal	My doctor prescribed me trazadone for sleep, a low dose of 50mg once a night. I took it for two nights in a row but the grogginess is horrible. It lasts the whole day up till 9pm and gave me a super bad headache. I didn’t take it tonight because of that but now I’m up (its 5am), anyone else had a bad experience? What should I do
Signal	I've been going to sleep in the afternoon because I'm just so exhausted that I can't keep my head up. Then I wake up between 9pm and midnight, and stay up all night. It's been an issue for decades, and I've never figured out how to flip it around.Are there any sleep therapists who keep office hours at 3am?
NotSignal	It only beats fast and hard at night :/ it bounces my body up and down. I can even feel it strongly in my ear and fingertips

Signal	So my problem for the past three months ever since quarantine started is that I wake up after between 3-6 hours (usually 4) and it takes me like 3 hours to go back to sleep. This worked fine when I didn’t have to get up for work but now that I have to be up early for work it’s hard to get enough sleep, especially because knowing I have to wake up stresses me out. I’m not having problems falling asleep though. So the doctor prescribed me Trazadone, I tried 25 mg and still woke up. And then 50 and it was actually worse and I was more stressed and woke up again and couldn’t fall back asleep for a long time and even then it wasn’t as much sleep as I wanted. Now with the work week coming up I’m trying to figure out what to do. I’m getting scared I’ll have to quit this internship because I won’t be able to work if I’m exhausted every day. I think I want a different medication or to be recommended to a sleep specialist. Some people say it takes a week for trazadone to work is that really true?
Signal	I know these have been posted a million times but I’m just here to get something off my chest. All of my life I’ve been a great sleeper. I would get that familiar heavy tired feeling pretty early and would lay down in my bed and be gone in minutes. Most things wouldn’t faze me (anxiety over school, work, whatever) and I could still sleep. I would have the occasional bout of insomnia (one specific time I can remember is the day before senior year of high school started) but I always got out of it and it never lasted very long.Well, I started having issues falling asleep during July, but I had just started an SSRI (Celexa) so it made sense. I was using Trazodone to initially fall asleep, but then I slept like a rock. Then, after a few days, I didn’t need the Trazodone and could fall asleep naturally. The issue seemed to resolve until the second week of August. I started requiring a higher dose of Trazodone to sleep, and it still took me forever to get to sleep. A few weeks of bad sleep later (I stopped the SSRI I was taking), I now require 100 mg of Trazodone to sleep, and even then the sleep I get is shallow and I feel unrefreshed in the morning. I’m easily woken up. I’m also having muscle twitches everywhere, random crying spells, lack of concentration, weird/strange thoughts, and I don’t care about anything related to school like I used to. Once I wake up in the morning I can’t go back to sleep. I used to be able to nap during the day too but even that is gone. I’m so scared and upset because I think I could have sFI or some other prion disease.
Signal	It takes me hours to fall asleep, I usually fall asleep at around 2 or 3am, and I wake up multiple times at specific hours during the night,usually it’s at around 4am, between 5 and 6am, and 7am. And if I move to check time or I’m uncomfortable , It will be hard to fall asleep again. If I fall asleep after 7 am, I will most likely wake up at 9 or 9.30 am and that’s it. So I sleep for 6 hours max, but usually less, because I struggle falling asleep when I wake up. The only times when i can get 8 to 10 hour sleep is when I don’t sleep for 36 hours.
NotSignal	my dog can't sleep properly because I keep turning over in bed, she hasn't had a good night's sleep for months because I can't maintain a good routine. I know I could at least try to reduce the problem, but no, as I already know I won't be able to sleep, I take the opportunity to make my situation worse and get agitated before bed, and she can't sleep because of me. okay, maybe this is a deserved curse on me, but she's just a dog and loves to sleep with her human, she doesn't deserve to be restless because of me.
NotSignal	First, turning my brain off. It’s like a child that doesn’t want to go to bed. I get in bed, put my head on pillow and brain decides to start thinking, asking questions, analyzing or worrying. Alcohol tends to shut it up, but I want to dial that back!Second, I do fall asleep (without alcohol). I go through a sleep cycle, wake up...well, now I’m well rested and wide awake. I quickly lose patience with how long it takes for my body to decide it needs another round of sleep - going through this right now. Fell asleep, was dreaming...now wide awake.Thoughts and suggestions???
Signal	It's 3am and I'm very tired. I have lots to do tomorrow and I need to sleep, yet I can't. I just lay in bed with my eyes closed yawning. This isn't just a one-night thing, I'm like this every night. I have anxiety and maybe thats why I can't sleep but insomnia runs in my family and I'm not sure if I have it. What do you guys think? Any tips on actually falling asleep?
Signal	I was prescribed seroquel for sleep and suspected bipolar disorder, 150mg every night. I lowered myself to 100mg as 150 was making me stupid as hell during the day and making it really hard to function and care for my son. However last night and two nights before that, 100mg wasn't even making me sleepy. I ended up taking 200mg each night in order to get some sleep. I have been on the seroquel for about 3 weeks now. I was wondering if it were possible to build up a tolerance? It was the only thing helping me sleep and now I'm really scared I'm going to end up right back in a bad spot. I ended up in inpatient psych care because I was so desperate for sleep I wanted to hurt myself. I do not want to get back there again.
NotSignal	I got in bed about 930 intending to go to sleep. It is now 1230 and im no where even close. I usually end up passing out around 2/3am, and unless I have to work a day shift I wake up around 11. I feel like I still get a normal amount of sleep but it just takes me forever to get there. I have to have some sort of naration playing or something to listen to (music doesnt work, only talking) I absolutley cannot fall asleep to silence. Im just wondering does this seem abnormal, even though I still feel like I sleep a full 6/8 hours at a time? Im kinda boderline whether I should see somone for it or not.
Signal	Hello you wonderful people, have had a breakthrough recently regarding my weird insomnia habit I have had for 10 or so years I think. I cant switch off in my bedroom at home. When I moved into a grandparents house temporarily to wait for a mattress to be delivered, suprise, suprise I could sleep. I was dreaming as well, atleast 4 or 5 dreams it seemed and building up some good sleep. Also my erectile health seemed to be getting better I was waking up with morning wood for the first time in ages.My bedroom has been conditioned over the years with rumination, overthinking and anxiety from having arguments with parents, like a timeout room. However, the atmosphere nowdays is much better and my bedroom is minimalistic and decluttered but somehow its like ive conditioned the bedroom with all these feelings that I cant switch off. Its like I never feel tired in my bedroom and as soon as I leave the house when either my mum drops me or i walk to my grandparents I start yawning. Over the years this sleep deprivation has caused me some shit with depression and I'm sure many other things, its the anhedonia that really bugs me. I feel depressed because of the lack of sleep. It is really ruined/ruining my life in every aspect and I'm sick and tired of it.Has anyone else ever been in a situation like this? And can I sort this out as I can't sleep round my grandparents forever, I want to recondition my bedroom but I don't know where to start.Thanks guys.
Signal	Night owl here. Can't sleep no matter the time.Since about 10 years ago, I started having periods of insomnia. Every year, every spring (and only spring, for some reason) I couldn't sleep for a week or 2. I used to take pills to fall asleep then, and they worked like a charm. But not anymore. They don't help me fall asleep, but they do prolong my sleeping. And my only problem is falling asleep, and not staying asleep. I'm having real trouble falling asleep. And it's only getting worse. Last night I slept for 14 hours because I didn't sleep 2 whole days prior to that. Usually, if I go to bed at 4 am, by 7 I'm asleep, but not that day. I was tossing and turning and got sick of not being able to sleep for days, that I just grabbed my novel and read 200 pages. I was tired, I was sleepy the whole time, but I couldn't sleep.I'm considering stress as the source of my insomnia, but the most stressful time in my life was last autumn, and I didn't have any problems sleeping then. I have the habit of reading 10 to 20 pages every night before bed. Google said it will make me fall asleep easier. But it doesn't. I also read that regular exercise can help with insomnia, and I've been exercising for the last month, 4 times a week (haven't skipped a day). That also doesn't help. I also read that exercising shouldn't be done later than 3 to 4 hours before going to bed, so I never exercise later than 10 pm.I also started drinking cocoa, eating bananas, trying to sleep in a pitch black room, anything I read on internet, and nothing works. And it's becoming a problem, because I have to study, and no sleep means no studying. Writing a diary and listening to relaxing music also doesn't work. Does anyone have a solution for me?
Signal	hey guys,so I've had long term problems with exhaustion and insomnia, but it's always been on and off. recently I had to start retaking antidepressants (zoloft 200mg) but that was at least more than a month ago. I had bad insomnia for about a week (classic antidepressants) and took over the counter sleeping aids to try to knock myself out with. they helped during that short time and things went back to normal for a little bit.fast forward to now. I've again had another insomnia lapse over the past four days now, and haven't been able to sleep more than an hour most nights. when I "sleep", it's always very light - my brain doesn't seem to switch off, so I'm actively aware of what is happening.I decided to take half a sleeping tablet last night to try to get some shut eye, but now more than 12 hours has passed and I'm still insanely groggy to a point where standing makes me feel dizzy. I hardly slept last night even WITH the help of the tablet, it just made me super sluggish. what should I do? I had to call in sick for work today because of it
Signal	I get lonely when I'm supposed to be sleeping but can't and my husband is snoring away. Tbh all I want to do is wake him but I'd feel guilty especially bc he works so hard to support us (I'm disabled and can't work) I've had horrible insomnia that's just been even worse the past month I just end up staying up until he leaves for work and I finally fall asleep at like 6 am then I sleep all day and feel guilty.
NotSignal	i just found this group after going through what you'd guess. i read through a number of posts and it struck me how all the symptoms, experiences, and larger thinking on it is exactly the same i experience virtually daily. it is true suffering to go through - and all of you understand. i have no words or advice just the deepest recognition of how dealing with this is something that takes over your life. one can feel enslaved, helpless. it is pure suffering. please hang in there everyone. my best to all of you going through these hard times
NotSignal	I was wondering if anyone with chronic insomnia experienced relief after moving one’s residence. My insomnia began 1 year ago after a traumatic experience in this apartment, and my mom keeps telling me I need to move out and get a fresh start elsewhere. But, I’m skeptical, since the problem seems to be fairly ingrained in my psyche now - so what’s to stop me from bringing the problem to a new location?Any thoughts/experiences?
Signal	Hi all,I am not sleeping at all. Now I have decided to continue the day awake to try and make me as tired as possible to knock me off tonight - hopefully it will. All I hear is thoughts, worries, increased heart disease, increase risk of stroke etc. Let me fucking sleep you stupid idiot. I have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid, always felt different. Had good and bad grades depending on how I slept. Always hyperactive, my brain works at 200%, very curious, reads a lot. Although, I have a low span of concentration, high anxiety, stress and depression. Not easy. If anyone relates to this, as a kid to sleep I used to turn my head on my pillow quite fast from right to left as a clock. Used to make me tired and think about other thinks. Worked. Now it bloody doesn't. I've changed. I looked on Amazon for some products to help (obviously had enough - affecting my student grades) and found some interesting stuff. Bought them and going to test soon. Here's what I bought- Zenflore (pills for stress and anxiety) - Weighted Blanket (Never tried one before. For stress and anxiety relief)- BioOnics Sleep Supplement (called "Pause")I have no clue if this work. But being in my desperate situation this WILL. My perseverance and my desire to live (even sometimes I can doubt that) will make me succeed and bloody well sleep. Wish me a good night and I wish you one too. Any advice is always appreciated. Always love to learn.Best regards,Tar2ed
NotSignal	I keep taking my meds at noon which make me stay up later because I am guaranteed to stay awake the rest of the day. (With my depression I sleep a lot but when I take my concerta it’s like my morning coffee. It I don’t take it I won’t stay awake throughout the day and keep taking naps)So when I wake up late, I take the meds late so it keeps me up late, and repeat. I feel so chatty right now and sometimes want to talk to someone new just because I feel so talkative. I know I should sleep but my head is filled with so many ideas and thoughts that I want to get down but I just can’t think straight. I can’t get comfortable in bed and it’s not like I need to be awake for anything other than doing chores around the house. I wish I could use this time to be really productive and work out but I just zone out and lay here waiting until I can relax enough to even curl up. I’m sorry for this whole post probably being incoherent but I just don’t know where else to go to talk. Does anyone else relate to this?
NotSignal	Hi everyone. I have recently posted here on how I overcame my insomnia using acceptance and commitment therapy from Guy Meadows. I just wanted to make another short post here that will hopefully help some people especially with sleep onset type of insomnia. I think a lot of trouble of falling asleep stems from ... trying too hard to fall asleep. Remember, normal sleepers do nothing to fall asleep, literally nothing except for closing their eyes. So if you can't fall asleep, tossing and turning, chances are you are doing too much of mental work without realizing it.So here I came with a quick recipe to catch yourself in the act of applying too much of mental effort to fall asleep. Try it on your next bad night. First, calm down for a couple minutes and allow yourself not to sleep for these couple minutes. Then for about 20 seconds force yourself into sleep. Force hard, so you can feel physical tension in your head, like if you are pressing on your brain. Memorize this sensation. Now, stop this effort and for another 20 seconds try hard to shut off you mind, really try to keep it numb and silent so you again can feel physical sensations in your head, like physical tension, pressure. Now, stop these efforts. Memorize sensations that you had while forcing yourself into sleep or trying to keep you mind numb! Now, just lie still and relaxed and don't try to sleep, just be present and don't apply any mental effort to fall asleep. If after some time you find yourself awake, check out sensations in your head/mind. Anything reminiscent of those forced attempts to shut your mind and forcing yourself into sleep? These sensations can be very mild, but after some practice you can learn to catch them. Do you feel that you apply some mental effort into nodding off? Do you ACTIVELY waiting for falling asleep and trying to assist your brain in shutting off? Stop it. Return to just being present in your bed, calm, with no intention to assist yourself into falling asleep. Just like a normal sleeper, do nothing, do not actively try to fall asleep and you sleep will return.My sleep returned to me as soon as I learnt to do nothing and stopped gently forcing myself into sleep. I hope this advice will be useful for someone here. Good luck.
Signal	Insomnia is a new thing for me. Up until a week ago, I could have been described as one of those "hit the pillow and I'm out" kind of sleeper. But that changed when I accidentally skipped a step in my sleep routine: taking Benadryl an hour before bed.Rather than take Benadryl to fall asleep, I used it as a means to stay asleep longer. But 5 days ago, I forgot to take it until right before bed. Internally I panicked, and didn't sleep one minute that night. Though I was able to fall the asleep the next night, having been awake for 40+ straight hours, one night later the same internal panic set in despite following all the steps of my usual sleep routine. I knew I "needed" to get a good night's sleep because I'd be working a 24-hr shift the following day, and that pressure caused another zero-sleep night. Despite trialing mindfulness apps, guided meditation, exercise (2:00 AM jog anyone?), the more time that went on the more my heart pounded and the more pressure I put on myself to fall asleep. It's gotten to the point now that I get palpitations from merely laying in my bed (even in the daytime without the intention of sleeping) or from listening to guided meditation.A lot of times I've heard insomnia described as an ability to turn off one's mind, a problem with decompressing with the previous day, worrying about external things. For me, I get anxious thinking about the sleep itself, which in turn leads to no sleep, which feeds back to more anxiety. Does anyone else deal with the feedback loop, and if so, how do you deal with it?
NotSignal	Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish you all a happy, peaceful, stress-free, joyful, contented, and restful 2020.I understand each of us face insomnia, and must deal with the effects, but my hope and prayer for you each is that it not rob you of your ability to enjoy and embrace the beauty that lay around you. Love well all that you come in contact, rise above petty arguments, toss aside bitterness, and be the person you were created to be.2020 - your year of triumph awaits you.
Signal	I'm becoming increasingly concerned at my sleep habits. My body is becoming increasingly exhausted. It is to the point where it feels like I've been awake for days at a time. I used to think it was going to bed late was the issue. But then I began going to bed early and the same problems began happening.I go to bed. Have an insane dream. And wake up three hours later. Then, every hour, I will wake up. This has been happening for atleast 8 weeks now, with a couple of dates sprinkled in of "good" sleep, where we'd last 5 hours. Should I seek medical attention? It's getting to the point where it feels like I've been awake for 4 days. I have an insane headache, and my mental state is just not great.
Signal	hey everyone, sorry if the formatting is bad, I'm one mobile. I'm really stuck here. I currently take lithium carbonate and seroquel. My psychiatrist has told me I have a parasombia a couple years ago and redisgnosed it a couple weeks ago. I have issues with sleeping through the night and a bit of sleepwalking. but it always comes in cycles of over sleeping and undersleeping.my doctor has told me that he can't give me sleep medication because of the current cocktail, which took a couple years to make effective. so no one really wants to change it (I'm a minor so it really feels like it's not my decision, and feels like I have no say in my mental health:/ )a couple months ago I really began struggling and the best thing my doctor could reccomend was 5mg of melatonin. I tried that. it worked (after kicking in) for about a month, then nothing, I tried taking 10mg (w/o consulting anyone, I know I shouldnt but I was and still am desperate) once again worked for a month then nothing. I've been by this same doctor I cant go above 10mg because of, once again, current cocktail. so now the melatonin has 0 effect, the sleepiness some get from seroquel is long gone. and I'm stuck. the last few days I have gotten less that 3 hours of sleep in total, all unresstful, waking up every 10 minutes, nightmare filled. I cant take it anymore, it's really effecting me and no one seems to understand.I've tried everything I can find. adjusting temperature, how I'm sleeping, when I'm sleeping, not eating before, no phone/blue light, asmr, making my bed- nothing is working and I'm snappy w everyones, crying a lot, generally unwell. I'm looking for any kind of guidance, I'm struggling.sorry this is a mess, thanos for any suggestions.
NotSignal	Has anyone taken Amitriptyline for sleep? Doc has recently recommended; I’m always weary about drugs, yet hopeful. Thanks in advance.
Signal	Sometimes I just can't go to school because I'd rather catch up and get some good sleep at home rather than fall asleep in half my classes because at the end of the day I'll be more tired and in worse shape than if I had just stayed home. My parents just don't get this. They claim they had insomnia when they were kids and they went to school on no sleep all the time. I think they're lying/over exaggerating. I've been waking up 6+ times in the night not knowing how much actual sleep I got and certainly not getting more than an hour or two of actual REM sleep for about a week. I've had bad insomnia, not being able to fall asleep and walking up several times in the night, for a long time, but this past week has been even worst. I don't know how I can even try to continue to get good grades when I'm not even able to catch up on sleep when I need to.
NotSignal	I used to skip school often at around 8yearsold. I would often fake being unwell and my mum/the nurse would assume I was sick. I would then be put to bed to "sleep of my illness" I liked this time my mum was always very attentive and nice to me. As I got older I would get anxiety about going to a very high pressure school, often being tardy and, when things were really bad, getting into school at lunchtime. I prize sleep above all else but have awful self control and no schedule.The only time I ever got it right was the year of my important exams in secondary (highschool), I would wake up at 6am every day to music do 40squats, have a cold shower, make pancakes and go to school. I would workout before bed and fall asleep at around 9 or 10.It was the only truly slef structured year of my life.How do I get back there?
NotSignal	Another night, another battle. Anyone still trying to fall asleep? What are you up to?I just specced out a ultrawide curved gaming pc with VR headset , rtx 2060 amd 8 core Ryzen 7. Using a Pentium 4 right now :/
Signal	Made an account just to post this. Tried Google but all I was getting was tips on sleeping better. It's 4am and I need advice. Some BG: My sleep schedule is horrible and always has been. I suffer(ed) from sleep anxiety over the past 5 years. It's been better now after practicing sleep hygiene, meditation and going to therapy about it. I suffer from seasonal affective disorder where I get depressed and insomnia. What I'm struggling with is having consistent quality of sleep. If I have a good workout, I will sleep amazingly that night. I will have a great day, I'm happy, cheerful, super productive, and feel invicible. However....., I will guarantee 100% sleep like absolute shit the next night. It's like my body is still thriving off that energy and I'm not fully tired. Either I fall asleep like usual but have awful, jolting awake from anxiety sleep, or bad dreams, or generally waking up feeling like shit. Or I can't sleep until like 2am. I'm anxious, Irritable, exhausted, can't focus at work, feel sad, dizzy etc.Exercising every day isn't an option because I need rest days or am sore. Or sometimes (like tonight) even exercising on a good day doesn't help my sleep. I'm having a really hard time because this literally alternates every single night. It's super annoying and declines my quality of life. I don't want these extreme highs and lows of sleep. It's not worth it. I want to sleep average so I don't have to battle through the zombie days. The good days are not worth how crappy I feel the bad days. Even if I take melatonin it doesn't help. Doctor prescribed sleep meds but I have too much anxiety over becoming reliant on it to take. I sleep between 10:30pm-11:00pm and wake up between 7:30am-8:30am for work. I exercise regularly, eat okayish. I have good sleep hygiene, I meditate regularly, use a white noise machine. Might be worth to mention I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. Not on medication as I can still function, therapy and CBT help so far. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I need advice please or to know if anyone else is in the same boat. Not so much advice on sleeping better, but how to stop this cycle of very good sleep and then shit sleep. I hate waking up like I didn't get any sleep and the struggle to get out of bed. I'm sick of this. Thanks in advance!
Signal	It never fails, I wake up at 4 am every day. This has been going on for 4 years. I wake up in a panic and I have to breath for 2 hours to calm myself down to go back to sleep. I just got tested and don’t have apnea. I notice I get a nightmare, but it’s never the same. It’s like a different one every night at 4 am. I’ve been doing meditation now for 2 weeks. It’s not working. I don’t know what to do. I need to sleep.
Signal	Hey guys, anxiety giving me problems later, and it shows on my sleep. Woke up yesterday and today with no "oh I have slept so good" feeling at all. All I remember I not being able to sleep at about 3am and then boom, 8:50 in the morning comes and I wake up. My guess is, wouldn't I be able to remember the time between 3 and 8:50am, if I hadn't slept at all?Is it possible that I slept, but still feel tired the next morning?
NotSignal	Hi everyone, so I’ve been suffering from insomnia for like 5 days already. Firstly, I was struggling with falling asleep, it usually took me more than an hour to finally get some dream. Frankly, this problem disappeared on the third day and I am able to fall asleep when I want to and it will take me a few minutes. But, along with this problem I had another one, I was waking up in the middle of the night and I am really sick and tired of this, you can’t even imagine how much it annoys me. I fall asleep at 11:30pm, but I wake up every night at 3-5am (by the way I’m not struggling with falling asleep after I wake up). Can anybody help me with this? I really really want to get rid of this, who faced the same problem?
Signal	my problem is that I can lie there for as long as I want, feeling tired as shit, totally relaxed and not anxious but I just don’t sleep. Most people say their brain still feels activated or their body doesn’t feel relaxed and that’s why they have insomnia but I feel totally relaxed both mentally and physically. Still no sleep. I’ve tried a few medications (I take antipsychotics daily but currently on a non sedating one, benzos are useful but I can’t take them often, weed is the best sleep aid ever but I can’t smoke anymore, hydroxyzine useful but doesn’t seem to help anymore, currently trying clonidine but all I feel on that is more physically relaxed.)Anyone else relate? Anyone successfully treat insomnia where you’re tired as shit, not anxious, not activated, but still not able to sleep? I’m reaching the end of my rope here and hearing from others who made it through the same thing would be encouraging.
NotSignal	I didn't know where to put this, this has been going on for MANY YEARS since I was 12 or 12I'm awake 100% not tired yet, I'm hearing weird noises. I'm alone in the house, I have prescriptions for different reasonsMy neighbors are sleeping, the person across the street is sleeping. There is no reason for these noises yet I hear them. Does anyone know what this is?
NotSignal	Ever since the covid lockdowns, my sleep schedule has been extremely messed up. I’ve been finding it extremely hard to actually fall asleep at night, every time I close my eyes to sleep I have a rolodex of ideas explode into existence preventing any mindless rest from happening. Struggling with feelings of hopelessness and definitely loss of inspiration in life have been huge factors presently, all I want is to feel like I have a purpose and to have a decent nights rest. Anyone else experience an endless flow of ideas all throughout the night preventing sleep?It ranges from things I want to do, ideas that may work, items i want to purchase, life goals, skills I want to achieve, and the list goes on and on.
Signal	Short post. Like many of you in lockdown who already had problems with insomnia.Am getting \~3hrs max sleep and then wake up again. Doesn't matter if I've been away for over 24 hours, still only get 3hrs sleep. Live in UK. Am a carer for a parent with MS, very vunerable. Cannot get support, GP doesn't phone back and due to shoulder injury chronic pain etc am just totally burnt out every day and exhausted.There is stigma about medicines which were made legal such as THC oil. Have found myself desperatly seeking advice and am willing to try anything. I don't know where to go from here. 32 male, single living with vunerable parent and already struggling as had been living this isolated life since last November when made redundant. I am sorry if this is petty or reads as a complaint. Am searching for advice. How to sleep.... where do I go from here?
Signal	okay so i’m really fed up of this. the last time i’ve slept for a good amount of time was around 2 weeks ago, and ever since i messed up my sleeping schedule again. i’ve been sleeping for 3-4hours every single night for 2 months straight and i managed to sleep early but then it got messed up again [it’s out of control, my insomnia is horrible]. and now i’m here in my bed wondering wtf to do to be able to sleep early like i did 2 weeks ago. help me. keep me sane i’m tired of this
Signal	Starting Seroquel today for my insomnia(not sure the dosage yet) after being on trazodone for a couple months as well as an SSRI for 2 years, what should I expect??
Signal	I am a 39 YO F who first experienced insomnia at the age of 21.I’m going to tell you my story...I think it’s great to share a “you’re not alone...here’s my experience”...but curious if anyone else has also had it a very long time? How have you gotten through life? Especially having kids and a career? Are there things you’ve done to otherwise enhance your health since insomnia is so hard on your immune system...well, so hard on everything really!I am not sure what triggered my insomnia, though I have a lot of theories. At 21, I was away from home for the first time, attending college in another state. I was a very insecure person, coming from a home with a verbally abusive parent and being much of a nerd/outcast through ELHI. Being away from home was great, but I had no friends at college and I was dating a guy with anger issues. It was also the first time in my life when I felt a sense of responsibility. I was studying hard, working full time at a bakery, and also started exercising. I really got into weight training and quickly lost 10 pounds of fat. I wasn’t overweight to begin with, but after a few months of this routine, I got down to 132 lbs at 5’9. I started to eat mostly protein and vegetables...and also protein bars with the fake sugar! I started using supplements, including Ripped Fuel. At this time (early 2000s), RF was primarily pseudo ephedrine. I started waking up in the middle of the night, starving and jittery. I should also mention that a few months into college, I had completed a full Accutane treatment, as I had bad acne. Not sure if that drug impacted my sleep, but lots of people have reported ongoing issues from having taken it.Anyway, once my insomnia continued for a few weeks, I went home to see my family doc about it. He said I’d lost too much weight and prescribed a benzo to help me sleep (I think Trazodone). That helped for awhile, though I felt groggy the mornings after taking it. But eventually it stopped working as well. I went through upping dosage and trying other medications. They’d work for awhile but then gradually would quit helping. I eventually learned that there wasn’t really any drugs on the market meant to treat long-term insomnia; everything was for short-term use. I eventually transferred to another college in a larger city. There, they actually had a sleep specialist and sleep lab associated with the city university. The doctor there told me that most of his patients are older and overweight, that typically insomnia - at least long-term - is associated with lifestyle and health factors. In my case - being young and not testing positive for any health issues that could be causing the insomnia- it was likely that the issue was psychological, meaning I’d either got into the habit of expecting not to sleep, so I didn’t, and/or else I have depression or anxiety. He prescribed me to another Rx, and for several years, I went through rounds of different meds or no meds and just kinda got through life. At one point, I took ibuprofen nightly, and at another juncture, was on Remeron which caused me to gain a lot of weight. I’m shocked that I graduated college and got a good job, though I will note that my life outside of work was mostly empty. I think the lack of sleep makes me more anxious, so already being a socially nervous person was just escalated. I mean, I had some friends, but nothing really close because I just couldn’t give much of myself. I was a notoriously flaky person, often canceling plans or just not showing up. It also made dating a hell on earth. I’d get so nervous that I’d have a really bad night of sleep before a date that it would end up being a self-perpetuating thing. I wouldn’t sleep and then either I’d cancel the date or else I’d be what I perceived was OFF (meaning, just acting weird or uncomfortable). I ended up taking an antidepressant for awhile (Wellbutrin), which helped the insomnia somewhat, but more than anything, it helped with my anxiety. I eventually weaned myself off of it once I felt I’d gained enough confidence to wing it on my own. By then, I was 30-31, independent, established, all those things that made me feel that I had enough footing to possibly not need an antidepressant. That was successful, but I will say that’s it can be dangerous to come off of an antidepressant or anti anxiety drug. Always talk to your doc on a safe way to do so. I was in a funk for about a month.By the time I was 34, I still had chronic insomnia. However, I owned my own home, was starting grad school and had a great job. I hadn’t taken Rx for it for years, and was really getting through by getting daily exercise, eating healthy, and doing a deep breathing routine. What I mean is that I was using natural remedies that were helping me sleep a bit more, but mostly were helping me power through the day. This was around the time that I met my husband. We crossed paths via an online dating site. He is 6 years older than I, and also never married. In one of our first email exchanges, he mentioned he has chronic insomnia. Our first date was short. I had one beer, got super intimidated, super tired, and told him I needed to go home. He walked me back to my car, where I explained to him the significance of my insomnia, and that if he wanted to see me, this condition comes with the package. I basically said it means I’m not the most exciting person, that there’s a lot of staying at home and general introversion. He texted me later that night, telling me he’d really like to see me again.We got married 3 years later. Turns out, my husband’s insomnia is as bad as mine, and he’s had it for just as long. And his dad has it. We had a child two years ago, and as we are both older and already sleep-deprived parents, I can tell you it’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever done. We’re not sure that we will have another child because going through another 1-2 years of less sleep than we were already getting seems overwhelming and insurmountable. What I will say is that it has been easier for me to fall asleep since gaining a family. I have such a deep feeling of stability and support. Being on a routine (b/c of my kid) and getting worn out each day from chasing a toddler has certainly left me exhausted by the time I get to bed. I do still have problems staying asleep, but it’s not every night now.Here’s a few things to leave you with: I share my story because I want others who have chronic insomnia to know that it doesn’t have to mean that you can’t have a full life. Yes, there are things I’m sure I missed out on because I didn’t have the energy to pursue them. I think the big thing I’ve learned about insomnia is that it can often perpetuate itself...what I mean is that if you don’t expect to sleep, you probably won’t. The other part of that is that I was able to do more once I just accepted that I was likely to be tired while doing whatever I was doing. Going to the gym, having a big party, leading a large work meeting...I got used to being able to do things I used to think I couldn’t do because I was tired. I worked through the issue, and honestly - oftentimes - I can forget I’m tired. If you are a young person who is dealing with insomnia, just know that it is likely that it will pass. Chronic insomnia is still pretty rare if you are young and healthy. I told my story in part as to illustrate that there’s a ton of stressors that young people have to carry. I never felt more anxious than I did than when I was in my 20s, early 30s. It’s a time when you’re trying to be independent and find your place in the world. Or at least, that’s my view of it.Here is how I am reducing my insomnia today: 1) Taking stressful people and situations OUT of my life. Now, not always possible, and also stress is very much based on your assessment of something and you can totally change your assessment. BUT if you CAN, get negative people and situations out of your life. My husband is a kind, gentle and totally supportive partner. My employer is very progressive and my boss is very relaxed and understanding. Having a stable and balanced home/work life has gone a long way to helping me feel relaxed, and thus able to sleep better at night. Like that one doc told me, if you don’t have any bodily health issues, your insomnia could very well be coming from a mental health issue. 2) Reduce inflammation, especially through diet. I eat less sugar, carbs, don’t have heavy meals before bed, etc. 3) Get some sunlight everyday or at least get one of those lamps that mimic natural sunlight. Getting sunlight, especially in the morning hours (as I understand it), helps your circadian rhythm. 4) Exercise, so many reasons to do this, not just to help with insomnia. 5) Do not do anything very arousing within the 3 hours leading up to bedtime. I don’t online shop, make calls, do social media, read news, work, etc. I have found that watching a slow-paced movie or show helps me nod off. Even more so than reading. I need more light to read than to watch a show. I just turn down the brightness on my monitor at night.Looking forward to hearing about you and how insomnia has impacted your life. So glad to have a community on Reddit where we can share our experiences, offer a sympathetic ear (technically eyes), and share what’s helped us.
NotSignal	I tried to kill it but I only got some legs. They regenerate. So now there’s a pissed off centipede in my bedroom waiting for its legs to regenerate to get revenge. I should be comforted that it’s probably not going to be very active tonight, after this injury. But I could hear it scuttling away and it sounded like the sound that I thought was a mouse. I don’t know why it is so loud. It was a pretty big bastard. But I’ve had confirmed mice make less noise...And yes, I know centipedes are harmless to humans. Yes, I know they eat other insects that would bother me. Yes, I know, I know, I know. If it was smaller, not in my bedroom, etc., I’d try to relocate it. I really would. But nah, once something is in my place of sleep... that’s it. It’s either dying or I’m not sleeping. I guess he won.
NotSignal	I got the Philips hf3430 today and I am loving it it rises my mood instantly. I had a very bad sleepless night, got up, got the mail and had 30seconds of blue light and literally all the grogginess from the bad night was gone! Apparently it can help with insomnia as well, does any of you have any experience with this?
Signal	I finally went to the doctors about my insomnia and was prescribed 5mg melatonin capsules, curious to hear about your guys experiences with it
Signal	I also took my benzo meds which usually help but nope! Imagine how it's like for me trying to sleep without benzos even.
Signal	Im 19F, over the last two weeks i have regressed a lot in my sleeping habits. I can’t seem to be able to sleep alone. I fall asleep when im with someone but im incapable of falling asleep alone. I have tried everything for the past two weeks. It all started when i started watching “dark” on Netflix. I feel pathetic and im just tired cause im actually very exhausted and all i want is to fall asleep. Now i have resorted to sleep with someone if i can’t fall asleep within 3 hours. I don’t know what to do HELP.
Signal	I can’t sleep again. I have school in a few hours and I every time my head hits the pillow and I close my eyes I feel stimmed, it’s like my mind is clear, but I have this mental drive. I have a very important school year ahead of me, but this is holding me down. Every time I sleep I end up falling asleep 2 hours ahead of the night before and eventually I hear the birds chirping and I have to rough it for the day. If I go to school with 5 hours of sleep I can’t learn, I don’t remember anything and I can’t concentrate. I have tried sertraline and it worked for a month or so, but then my symptoms ended up being worst then before. I have also tried melatonin and it sort of worked, but was kinda shit. I have tried meditation and those bedtime stories apps, but they don’t work and I don’t enjoy them. I’m going to arrange to see my doctor tomorrow to see if he can prescribe me something. If anyone has tips I could really do with hearing them.
NotSignal	I litteraly can't sleep. Ive been awake for three days and my body is tiered but I can't sleep. I've done a bunch of things to help me sleep but it's just not working.
NotSignal	Hi guys, I'm new to insomnia so apologies if i sound out of touch or ignorant. I just cant seem to understand the reasons for it.I'm usually away at uni, but since the quarantine I have been at home with my family and have found out that my 25 year old sister suffers insomnia and she cant sleep until early hours of the day. My parents are both 'understanding' about it and they will make as little noise as possible during the day which has also lead to my dad playing his guitar much less (which he loves to play). But in response to this, I have noticed how awful her attitude and behaviour is; she is loud when we're asleep, she doesn't offer to clean up around the house, pretty much only offers negative energy the majority of the time. I will say that she does have good days but on those days she doesnt improve her attitude or behaviour, it still remains shitty. I made the mistake a few days ago suggesting that it's probably brought on by other factors like constant screen starring, being in the exact same surroundings all day, watching films until late etc. I understand now that this was a wrong mindset to have and to especially say to her, but she didnt explain it to me, instead she just passively aggressively dismissed me. But I want to understand it. I want to not have feelings of resentment towards her. I'd really welcome some advice/insights about it all as I feel incredibly ignorant about it all right now. Also, is a known side effect having a shitty and 'the world is about me' attitude? I assuming it isn't, I believe that my parents have only enabled her attitude and behaviour.Again, apologies if I have come across like an ignorant ass, I'm just trying to understand it all.
Signal	Hey all, I symphathize with all of you. Insomnia leads to a miserable life. It is not easy what we are going through.&#x200B;I am curious what books you read when you get out of bed? Also, what light you use? I dont want to keep myself up.&#x200B;Thanks!
NotSignal	A lot of articles write about eating 2 kiwi’s before bed to help improve hour sleep. An example: https://thesleepdoctor.com/2013/11/26/kiwi-super-food-for-sleep/Has anyone tried this? I’d like to hear your experiences
Signal	Boys,I've always been someone that had to be exhausted from a long day or similar or else I wouldn't fall asleep, well at least not in a reasonable amount of time. I doesn't matter what I do, I've tried several things like meditation, counting sheep, drinking a big 'ol glass of warm milk. I usually lay in bed for hours thinking, just thinking and I believe it may be anxiety(don't wanna self-diagnose) because I'm afraid of a lot of things the future beholdsThe reason I just realized it (again tbh) was that I was high the last few years. Not all the time obviously but like the last 4 years, it must have been less than 10 days where I **had to** sleep without smoking something. I was always the *1 Joint before bed* kinda guy. I must have legitimately forgotten how much trouble I had sleeping before I started smoking and it must've been one of the reasons why I even liked smoking before bed so much.So now I'm trying to quit weed and wanted to ask what you guys do or take to combat insomnia
NotSignal	So when its time to go to sleep I usually stay awake watching my phone or something and waking up the next day sucks. And every time I try to fall asleep I still cant. But here is the deal, I have this feeling like I dont really want to sleep, wtf is going on?
NotSignal	How the heck does this work?I am trying to shift my bedtime to 10 and wake up somewhere around 6.I just woke up. Is the most important part if I fall back asleep to not stay asleep past 6?
NotSignal	I have anxiety so I panic when things don’t go as expected. This has caused more than a few problems. The past month has been a mess of public holidays and overtime. During which, I got confused over how much I was supposed to be paid and sent a couple of messages to my boss asking for clarification. The second time he snapped at me, apparently feeling I was accusing him of something. That was never my intention.I was hoping to let things blow over and hold back for a few weeks, but it happened again with an actual pay issue this time. I know I’ll need to bring it up, but I’m sure any attempt on my part will just make things worse.I keep ruminating over what I’m going to say and what can go wrong. For the most part I don’t even care what happens, I just want to understand what is going on and have some stability, but my mind will not let it go. I can understand where he’s coming from and why he sees it that way, but it really doesn’t help. I keep spiraling on the subject, getting more and more agitated. I put off sleep because whenever I close my eyes that’s all I can think about. Everything I try fails because the moment I relax the anxiety comes back. It’s been stressing me out for the past couple of days and knowing I might have to bring it up tomorrow is making things worse.I mostly wanted to get something out, so I posted on here. Thank you for listening.
Signal	Ive suffered with forms of insomnia for nearly two years now and have experimented with a number of things.I would constantly be woken up way too early, and started covering my eyes with a light but dark-colored scarf and wearing noise cancellation headphones. That seemed to get me about 20% improvement. Followed with some magnesium sups that gave me maybe 25% improvement... thinking that stress was my main issue.The big fixer came when I took magnesium sups that also had seratonin precursors in it, namely L-Tryptophan (the magic turkey amino that makes u sleepy) and 5-HTP.From what I read L-Tryptophan turns into 5-HTP which naturally turns into seratonin in your body.I started having deep, dreamy sleep, and was able to sleep in, everytime I took this sup. Before I would always wake up like 5-6am. Now I can sleep until 10am.When I stopped taking the sup, sleep went bye-bye. I played around with it and other similar supplements to try to isolate what was causing the deep sleep, which led me to believe that I have seratonin deficiency.From what I understand seratonin naturally turns into melatonin at night, but straight up melatonin rarely worked for me... higher up the amino chain worked... Some of you may have tried this and still have insomnia but in case you havent seen explored this yet, please research on seratonin and its related aminos, to see if it may be of help.I dont take antidepressants/SSRIs, because they havent helped me. But take note that taking seratonin precursors in addition to these drugs can put you at risk for very dangerous Seratonin Syndrome.Always talk to your doctor and be safe. And keep trying new things!I'm happy that I've made progress, and seems to be working so far.
Signal	Any opinions, warnings or advice for taking Belsomra? Insurance won't give me Lunesta, which I've had before & it worked but insurance won't let me have it until I try Belsomra - I've been taking sleep aids since 2007. Started with pain+pm like Tylenol pm, tried all of those and they stopped working. I take Seroquel, Klonopin, Melatonin, CBD, and I use marijuana medicinally and still it's impossible to fall asleep and get real sleep.Ambien did absolutely nothing. Trazadone helped somewhat for about a week. Then I found Sonata, it saved me. Until a few months ago when the side effects of sleep paralysis, vivid dreams, waking up crying & in contorted positions.
Signal	Hiiiiiii. Hope everyone is on their way to a good nights rest. I’m currently taking Doxepin 50mg and catapres .01 and I sleep like a damn baby every night. This was after suffering from insomnia for 10 plus years and trying every single med that didn’t work for me. Well now it’s 5 years later, and I just can’t stand the weight gain from the Doxepin anymore. Thinking of switching. What sleep meds have YOU taken that work and don’t cause weight gain? Wishful thinking??
Signal	Used to smoke weed for a long time and quit, did it once one night like 2 weeks ago and I got mad anxiety ever since I haven’t been sleeping barely at all. I went to the docs and took temazepan but could only take it for 10 days so I went cold turkey and now I can’t sleep. I get so fucking anxious now thinking about going to sleep, Slept for about 15 mins two nights in a row. I’m seeing a psychologist, I just gotta know that I can recover from this and it won’t be my whole life :(
Signal	Despite being a college student, I have had severe, chronic insomnia for the better part of a year now. I oftentimes go 3-4 days a week without sleeping, and it has been taking a toll on me in every aspect of my life.I’ve been prescribed a boatload of meds by my psychiatrist - not at once, but just to test out (e.g. guanfacine, clonidine, trazodone, xanax, ativan, ambien; and of course OTC options). However, barring the benzos, the meds rarely put me to sleep and primarily just induced even more drowsiness in the morning, so I don’t usually bother taking them.On nights I’m particularly frustrated with my insomnia, I end up stacking my meds. Tonight I took 2mg guanfacine, 0.1mg clonidine, and 2mg xanax... and have not slept a wink. Highly frowned upon, I know :/, but my insomnia has been ruining my quality of life, health, social life, mental well-being, and productivity (as a college student) for months. In the spur of the moment during the middle of the night, my thought processes tend to be a little rudimentary and short-sighted: I just need rest, and would do anything to get it.Even with all these meds, alone or stacked, I still often spend hours on end laying awake. At a certain point I often just give up and get up for the morning, but am obviously exhausted for the rest of the day.I know that my medication troubles / the underlying causes of my insomnia can only be resolved by a physician, but in light of COVID-19, my University’s health service center has canceled all non-essential appointments. In the meantime, I just wanted to seek any advice from people who have coped with similar issues regarding sleep deprivation before I can further my professional treatment and eventually (hopefully) get it resolved. I would greatly appreciate any advice, tricks, or suggestions on how you guys have lessened the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation on mood, mental health, and physical well-being. I am open to trying any supplements, any suggested lifestyle changes... meditation apps... prescription suggestions... podcasts... anything whatsoever that has helped lift up poor spirits after day(s) of sleep-deprivation.Thanks again!
NotSignal	Hi. I'm 13. On Monday night, I got no sleep. On Tuesday night, I got 6 hours. Last night, I got 3 hours. Now, I'm here awake at 3am again. I do everything I possibly can to sleep. My whole life seems to revolve around it. Nothing helps. Please help, I'm beginning to feel insane.
NotSignal	I've finally managed to get an appointment with a sleep doctor. It's very expensive here and it's really hard to get an appointment. I've been requested to submit information on my last two weeks of sleep. I was thinking about this and if I was to do this, it would not reflect how severe my insomnia is because I take a lot of sleeping aids. I could go cold Turkey but then withdrawal from the aids will also give an inaccurate reading on it.Has anyone had any experience on this and can recommend what would probably be the best way to go about it? Thank you.
Signal	I'm going through a really bad phase of insomnia which all started around christmas eve. I was out with friends on christmas eve and ended up falling asleep on my friends couch and awoke early and quite hungover. That day I was so tired all day but when It got to bed time I didn't feel any more tired and just stayed in my current tired phase. I ended up not sleeping for the next 5 days (i got 3 hours after 1 10mg zolpidem on the 5th day - my doctor prescribed me these, but used to give me zopiclone which i found worked better)So I ended up going to an out of hours doctor (back home with parents) got zopiclone and slept okay with zopiclone for the next 4 days, then I stopped zopiclone, didn't really sleep the first night off, second night off was pretty bad but next night was okay, then last night I was half asleep half awake still 2 o clock i decided enough was enough and took half a zopiclone slept from 2am-3.05am then was awake ever since. Probably should of taken a full tablet but I had to be up for half 7.So.. today I am wrecked I feel completely off my senses are ruined, sounds that are really far awake sound close and my perception of everything is off, my eyesight is terrible so I text in sick and it's my first day back today I feel so bad.I hate insomnia, this is like my fifth "phase" of it to go through. Literally one bad night can spiral out of control for me and I go into this weird phase of just constantly tired but unable to sleep.
NotSignal	This seems to be happening to me on a more frequent basis. Typically I'll be extremely tired all day during these days and then get super awake as soon as my shift ends and the cycle rewinds.I'm incredibly excited for our imminent systemic collapse so I won't have to deal with this any longer.
NotSignal	We are Well on our way into that part of the year where the sun is out 24/7 and its literally going to be impossible to sleep
Signal	It seems to take like an hour or an hour and a half to put me to sleep. I take it around 9 and don't fall asleep until 10 or 10:30. I'm in bed when I take it and haven't been watching tv in bed. I'm only using my bed for sleep.I'm sleeping like 12-13 hours on lunesta when I don't set an alarm. Normal? I'm on 1 mg. I sleep fine. Some waking up in the morning before I wake up wake up but I sleep through the night.
Signal	Here's what I've tried with no avail... a) melatonin (I have to take 30 mg for to even make me sleepy, which I've heard isn't safe) b) I megadose magnesium (8-12grams, although a lot, magnesium is very safe in high doses, it primarily becomes a laxative in those ranges ... helps but not strong enough to combat rebound insomnia c) exercise, up to 3 hours of cardio, at least 6 hours before bed time d) benadryl, works well but makes me very jittery and have anxiety the next day e) have tried numerous herbs aka chamomile, passion flower, st. johns wort.... all of them make me a tad drowsy, but are very weak for DRUG WITHDRAWAL INSOMNIAIs there anything I am forgetting that might work while I taper off this anti-depression/sleep med (Remeron/Mirtazapine) ?
NotSignal	Prolly not original but neither is my brain or insomnia
NotSignal	I remember feeling though as if I fell asleep, I didn’t actually sleep. Not in a tired way, I’m talking about time wise. I’d fall asleep and then wake up feeling like no time had passed. Now, I don’t know why but that concept to me is strange. I felt like I could easily deep sleep every night, now I don’t know. I have to be extremely exhausted to get that feeling again. I feel like a lot of people take it for granted, and that’s perfectly fine. It’s such a nice feeling though, to feel well rested. I’m capable of going to bed at a “normal” time, but whether I like it or not, I’m going to be waking up almost every hour until I decide it’s time to actually get up. NOT a good feeling :(
NotSignal	Hey all,It’s my first time here. I get bouts of insomnia that are awful and usually tied to my mental state of minds. Recently this week I had been doing terrible over the course of 3 days I barely got 6 hours. Then I got a new mattress, sheets, comforter, and pillow and I’ve been sleeping amazing the last two nights. I’m still just as stressed and nothing has changed but this has been a nice reprieve. If you’re interested it was the purple mattress, sheets, and harmony pillow.
Signal	Currently having one. I’m about 120 lbs and I’ve taken 1mg before, didn’t put me to sleep, 2mg before, didn’t put me to sleep, so I’ve decided to take 4mg tonight and although I usually get bad anxiety from any sleep medication (Advil pm, Tylenol pm), this time it’s a full blown panic attack. I’m actually borderline impressed I’m even able to type this right now. It’s extremely uncomfortable and I keep feeling like I’m dying or something. I just wanna sleep like a normal person so I’m wondering if anybody else gets anxiety on melatonin.
NotSignal	Been struggling with insomnia for about 5 months now, lately it has been better but since last week my sleep has become completely unrefreshing. I don't have trouble falling asleep, however I keep waking up at night. last night I slept 10 hours in total, waking up maybe 3 times or so. The only reason I can think of that would cause this is anxiety, as insomnia keeps triggering my sFI fears, but man I don't know. My doctor is dismissive of the possibility of sleep apnea and keeps insisting on not getting a sleep study for some reason, and I don't know what to do at this point. Oh well.
NotSignal	So I’ve always had trouble sleeping but lately it’s been much worse for the last few weeks. I’ve been having less that 3 hours of sleep from not being to sleep and having to wake early.The worst thing about it is when I close my eyes my thoughts and the images I see go all crazy and like flash in my head. I sometimes hear explosions in my head randomly when I’m trying to fall asleep and it gets me extremely scared because it’s so loud and real.Can someone help explain this a bit?
Signal	Hey guys,I haven’t been able to sleep correctly in 2 weeks and it has caused me to feel as if I’ve lost my mind. The outside world feels like a blur, looking at my phone doesn’t look right either, I’ve lost perception of time, and i feel very hopeless.I’m very fatigued and when i try to go to sleep, my mind doesn’t shut off. I’ve never had issues like this before (I usually fall asleep with no problem) and I’m scared as shit. I was prescribe someAnxiety meds that calm me down but they don’t help my brain rest ( I still feel awake). I feel like I can’t even think correctly, like I’m no longer going to be functional again. Has anyone gone through this before? Please tell me I’m not alone. If so, please tell me what helped you.
NotSignal	To get some sleep. I’m not even tired. I want to get in a car, roll the windows down, drive down town, enjoy the summer night air, take a walk across the bridge, talk about life, feel beautiful. Anything but to lay in this bed, alone, without a drop of drowsiness.
Signal	I don't know if it only happens to me but with all the sleeping pills I've tried so far when I take them before sleep and sleep like a baby the main problem comes when I wake up since when I wake up I'm still feeling the effects of the sleeping pills, meaning I'm still sleepy from the sleeping pills I took last night. I've tried reducing the amount but if I do that then I end up waking up in the middle of the night like if I never took any sleeping pills.My question is simple, those who have the same problem like me, what do yo do to reduce the effects during the day? To avoid being sleepy during?
Signal	I wrote on here a few weeks ago on how i couldn't sleep do to the fear if someone coming to get me in my sleep. My sleeping habits git better for a while, but its been a week and I cant sleep till 2 or 3 a.m. whenever I try to sleep and lay down my body starts to get this weird pulsating feeling like ik getting shivers down my spine. The first time this happened my heart rate went really fast. My family thinks its anxiety but I dont know what it is. Any advice?
NotSignal	Like wtf do you think I’ve been doing for the past three hours, baking a pie??Actually yes, I was baking a pie.
Signal	I have really bad insomnia, my meds don't work and my only way of being able to fall asleep is listening to my special audios on my phone (typically asmr or certain videos) and that's the only way I can get to sleep but my dad doesn't believe that and isn't letting me (albeit he does it rarely but still) and I got no sleep yesterday and was looking forward to tonight to sleep... This just sounds like me being a brat but this is literally the only solution I've found to work in 7 years.. I'm so tired and I was looking forward to sleeping tonight but my father has now taken it away (yes I'm typing on my phone cause I snuck it to the bathroom but I'll be yelled at if I get caught tomorrow with headphones on..) I feel sick and I just wanted to sleep and I'm so deprived that I've started crying and I hate it..
Signal	It's my third day on Zopiclone for insomnia. Been taking 5mg 30 min before bed and it made me sleep 10-11 hours straight each night. Normal? Lmao. I'm used to 3-4-5 hours of sleep because of my insomnia..
Signal	The past couple months I have physically been unable to sleep, the sleep I do get is when I unintentionally pass out and then I wake up dazed back in the same position as last timeI suffer from pretty terrible depression as is and this is making everything 10 times worseAnd when I try and just sleep at night, if there's no stimulation my mind races and its not uncommon to bring on panic attacksI'm going insane
Signal	I’ve been suffering from chronic insomnia for years now, when I was younger they told me I would grow out of it, I’m 21 now and I can’t sleep, I’ve always had problems with my sleeping habits. After going through two back to back traumatic experiences I slept with the lights on & on the floor for 2 years even tho I had a bed that was completely fine to sleep in but I just couldn’t do it (I was 15) & now it’s to the point where I chew my nails down till their bleeding when I try to sleep and I can’t control it. Idk who to do to for sleep help, rn with COVID & trying to social distance I’m at lost where to go for help. Is there any way to get help online? What doctor do I go to? Or should I try natural sleep aids, I’ve tried several brands before but they never helped. But if you have any recommendations that have helped you please let me know. Sorry this is all over the place.
Signal	I’m new to this group, I’m from the UK (it’s currently 4.30am) and ever since we’ve went into lockdown I’ve been struggling to sleep. It seems to be getting worse every night. I feel so unbelievably anxious and exhausted, every time I feel sleepy I try to switch off but I just can’t, my mind won’t let me and I all of a sudden feel really hot which makes me get out of bed! Don’t know how to tackle this... any advice welcome 🥺
NotSignal	So I have been using tea/night lights since I was young. Even now at 22 I’m using them. My doctor says have a dark room will “cure my insomnia” but without a night light or tea light I get panic attacks or stay up all night worrying. But it takes me longe to sleep with tea lights on. I tried Tylenol PM but it’s not safe to take it every night. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to turn my phone off an hour before bed but let’s be honest it’s impossible to do so
NotSignal	So basically everybody (family, friends, counselor lady) tells me that I should just relax and I try, I try my hardest to relax but just can't, I just really don't know what's happening or why this is happening but ive been sleepless for two days now (not on medications since day 1 btw) the counselor lady tells me that I just need some sleep a good long sleep that I am unable to do its been getting worse for about 2 years now and I just really don't know what to do anymore, people say that it'll all be fine but I'm having doubts about what they say, I would sometimes suddenly dream about waking up but not being able to move during this dream (sleep paralysis or smthng not sure if it is) there are things I'm hearing inside my pillow and walls and it scares the living shit out of me how do I stop these dreams from happening and should I just get some pills or smthng I'm not really good with this whole mind over matter thing that they tell me to do
Signal	I've been waking up every 1-2 hours in the past few days. I can usually fall back asleep, but I still wake up afterwards. I tried CBD, melatonin, sleep tea...Nothing helps. What could be causing this?
NotSignal	I’ve heard that night owls choose not to sleep and insomniacs can’t sleep. When I can, I go to bed at 4 am and wake up at 1 pm, I can’t fall sleep before at least 1 am no matter what and I know I don’t choose to sleep at this time
Signal	I was just wondering if anyone here has experienced anything similar to what I am about to describe. I've posted here about my situation a couple of times, but this whole idea of not sleeping/not sleeping well is fairly new to me and I am still working on all the proper steps to getting it figured it out. It started about a month ago, with a week where my sleep was very broken up/nonexistent despite never having had any sleep problems before. I didn't feel " sleepy" (but was definitely exhausted) and could not rest. I was shaky, sweating profusely (soaking through clothes and having to take multiple showers a day), having heart palpitations, mind racing, eyes twitching and not staying closed when I would try to sleep, felt like a light show was happening on my eyelids when I closed them, dizziness, feeling off balance. Really just a bad time.The week following that, I slept normally with no problems. 8 hours or more a night, sleepy feelings coming to me and putting me out around the same time every night. None of the symptoms I described above were happening.The next week, I began to have trouble again. It was not as bad as the first week, and symptoms as I described were not as prevalent (no profuse sweating, and the rest of the symptoms described were either much more reduced or nonexistent). I had one night where I didn't sleep at all (around this time I started smoking weed a little bit before bed to help me sleep, it definitely has been helpful), and the rest were full of very broken sleep. I had trouble falling and staying asleep during the night, and felt like sleep that I did get was not very deep or restful. I would make up for it with cat naps during the day. This kind of pattern lasted for about two weeks. At least I hadn't lost the ability to sleep like I thought (SFI became a big fear of mine). It wasn't great sleep, but it was still sleep nonetheless. I think the weed helped me get back on track. That leads us to this current week, starting on Saturday night. This past week, I once again have had almost zero issues with sleep. Solid 8+ hours every night, sleepy feelings coming to me, falling and staying asleep with no problems. Last night, I had a bit of trouble falling asleep, but I did still did sleep. I was worried that I wouldn't based on how I was feeling, but it ended up being okay. On the nights where I can't sleep, it always feels the same, the only thing that changes is the degree to which it affects me/how bad the symptoms are. In general, I feel like my brain won't shut off even though I'm not thinking about anything in particular, and I feel that the most prevalent symptoms aside from the first week have been my heart racing and my eyes feeling twitchy when I close them. I don't know what changes during these times as I have been trying to establish routines and good habits in order to facilitate sleep. Avoiding caffeine at all costs, trying to have a bedtime routine of sorts, things like that. It seems like nothing really changes between the stretches where I can sleep and the ones where I cannot. I am also still working on getting this all figured out. I have a thyroid condition but have never seen an endocrinologist. My primary care doctor is not sure how to approach the symptoms I've been having and seems in general to not know how to manage my thyroid issue properly. I have an endocrinologist appointment on Monday, and I'm hoping that they might be able to give me some answers and that maybe something will come up that explains what has been going on with me. I have still been smoking to help in the meantime.**TL;DR:** Just wanted to see.... Has anyone ever experienced these types of fluctuations with going between being able to sleep completely normally for days at a time and then experiencing insomnia for days at a time after that? What causes it, if anything at all?
NotSignal	My bunny keeps hopping and my bed and demanding attention each time I close my eyes. She is driving me nuts. Not only can I not sleep, but I can’t even try to sleep cause of her. I still love her but for the love of God..
NotSignal	Does anyone know of some great books they have read that help to truly understand sleeping and how to combat insomnia? I’ve looked online but couldn’t find much. Thanks!
Signal	It all started with anxiety from severe depersonalization. I started feeling lots of brain fog and even confusion. Can’t think straight, and just totally outside of my body.Then one night I got crazy scary thoughts that felt uncontrollable as soon as I closed my eyes. It was overwhelming and since I couldn’t think clearly, it was hard to even get control of the images and thoughts. It’s like my brain was talking to itself. Eventually I gained control but couldn’t sleep. I was so anxious. So it all stems from anxiety.But I’ve been feeling a lot better recently. And I still can’t sleep.... the confusion is worse. I can’t tell if it’s me overthinking from dp or if it’s sleep deprivation. Not sure if it’s temporary or permanent...My question right now is: how long does it take for benzos to start working? I’m trying out 50mg trazadone and so far it’s been 3 nights with absolutely no results. I also tried 7.5mg of Restoril for one night and it literally had zero effect. Also in the ER I only slept one hour. They left me with no medicine. I’m at a loss. I don’t want this to be forever. I have no history of sleep problems and as far as I know it doesn’t run in my family either. Is this episodic or did I break my own brain?I’ve also tried: hella melatonin, meditation, exercising, showering before bed, rescueremedy, CBD oil, teas, podcasts, music, silence, no silence, etc in terms of the natural route. Nothing has worked.Please tell me this gets better... because I’m afraid for myself. I’m only 24.
NotSignal	Until the other night I've been fine, but then I went to bed especially late and birds were tweeting. That was a little annoying and kept me up a bit, but not for too long.Then the next night I went to bed slightly earlier but couldn't fall asleep because I kept thinking "I bet the birds are going to start tweeting soon" and subconsciously listened out for it, so ironically I couldn't sleep until they started. Then the NEXT night I went to bed much earlier but the same thing happened, until last night I found myself becoming alert with a pang of anxiety every time I was about to drift off, before I eventually fell asleep after - you guessed it - I heard the birdsong.I guess my subconscious mind is now caught in this habit. I think it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy now, because I go to bed hoping it doesn't happen and therefore it does. It's not a huge problem rn with lockdown, but I definitely don't want to still be only able to sleep at dawn when regular working hours come back around. Any way I can distract myself and slip away? My brain is being a real asshole right now.
Signal	The gummies I found have L-theanine and other natural supplements. Most sleep aids have the opposite effect on me and I built up a resistance to melatonin. I was off for a while tried the gummies and I’ve been sleeping more consistently.I used to wake up in the middle of the night and have a hard time falling asleep due to an overactive mind. Most likely I suffered from anxiety induced sleep inconsistency coupled with some unique brain chemistry. It’s not perfect and my sleep schedule is still irregular but I’ll take the small victories.
NotSignal	Now most of you have at least some problem with a lack of "sleep drive" - lying down for a long time without feeling the sleepy feeling come on, no matter what you did during the day to coax the sandman to show up at night.Those who have recovered even partially, and gotten the natural urge to sleep back, how specifically did you do it? Any CBTi programs, self training. Mostly interested in finding ways without dependency on pills.
NotSignal	I've never really been able to fall asleep easily, it usually takes around two to three hours on average, although once I do it's very common that I go into very deep sleep, like sleep through earthquake (which has happened.) Though whenever I'm trying to fall asleep I will randomly notice that although my mind is trying to fall asleep, my eyes will be wide open staring at my wall or something. I don't even notice it very much either, I can't fall asleep when it happens, but it's almost like nothings different than from when I close my eyes. Also, I twitch my thigh very violently for some reason when I'm about to rest, it happens every night too. Does this happen to anyone else?
NotSignal	Hi all,getting more brighter over here in OZ. I usually use eyemasks as my bedroom is bombarded with windows, especially as the sun rises lol. I find that folliculitis (scalp cystic acne) becomes too strong when I wear the mask for too many nights or sometimes I believe it occurs due to the 'pressure' or the light chafing between the strap and the skin. I was wondering if anyone else had this issue? Maybe a differnt mask may work with a softer material and tug?
NotSignal	It’s 1:42 am and I’m salty af towards people that can just sleep. Like just fall asleep. Like I can’t do that. I try and try and try. I listen to music, I have a warm rice bag, I have a comfy fan with a slight breeze. NOTHING WORKS.
Signal	So, I already have talked with my doc about how my natural sleep cycle is the 2 AM to 10 AM cycle, but it's never been an issue. I would just lay down when I was tired around 2 AM, fall asleep in a half hour or so, out like a light, maybe wake up briefly once or twice, but fall back asleep. Except now...I've always had migraines which are triggered by lack of sleep, and when I had a week long period of migraines last month, I thought the sleep issues would go away once my migraines stopped. Well the migraines left, and yet, still, for the past week and a half, doesn't matter how tired I am, when I go to sleep, if I turn off electronics for an hour or two before sleeping. I lay down, tired. I can't fall asleep. I lay there for hours, it starts getting light out, and then maybe I fall asleep briefly for an hour or two. If I DO fall asleep around 2 or 3, then I end up waking up at 6 or 7 AM anyways and can't sleep afterwards. This has just come out of nowhere. I know I've probably had some hormone changes lately, so maybe that's it??? But I'm really at a loss. I know it would be best to talk to a doc about this, so if people can't give me really indepth advice, I'd still appreciate some pointers on what sort of questions and information to go into the doctor's office with.
Signal	I have been doing great with sleeping since I started working. I took a week off to regenerate. Instead of that after some days I started not sleeping well, falling asleep at 3am which isnt that bad for me but wasnt a thing since I started working. I always have problem falling asleep, not staying asleep. I instantly started having anxiety again which ruined this even more. Then for the first time I slowly managed to stop my sleep anxiety since that always causes me insomnia.Just when I succesfully stopped my sleep anxiety, it was refueled by the fact I started to have sore throat along my parents, during the pandemic not the best thing. I still cut off anxiety and got to sleep early yesterday, only to have nightmares about being infected and dying and waking up after less 3 hours of sleep. I can count on my fingers how many times I wome up so early,.. I happily took a nap in the afternoon but besides that I cannot sleep at all. I feel this dizzy before the sleep feel which always knocks me out, and I am completely relaxed. Despite this I still cant fall asleep at all. Idk what else I can do, this is driving me nuts.&#x200B;I worry I will lose my job if this continues to escalate into more severe insomnia.
NotSignal	What are other sources of bluelight that can interfere with sleep aside from digital screen
NotSignal	Do yall not even feel sleepy anymore even when you havent slept for days??
Signal	So at first zopiclone wasn’t working. I took a break and changed my diet and it helped restless legs syndrome which helped me fall asleep on zopiclone. I had to transfer to diezapam. 10mg and I’m still not tired? This worries me, I don’t understand what else I can do. I have a sleep routine and I do a lot in the day. I’m tired of not being tired at night. I don’t rlly wanna try any more meds because one they only give them to you for short term, and b- I’m just a bit worried about other meds. The benzo’s and Z drugs all work pretty similarly so pointless going in that area. Lavender/ bath/ music/ reading all that stuff isn’t working. I’m not anxious about anything much I feel pretty relaxed apart from when I don’t sleep. I’m not racing with thoughts. It’s tiring now as I thought I had it under control. Any techniques other than the generic ones anyone can offer?
NotSignal	So basically I've been sleeping at very late hours for about 6 months and for like 2 years I've been hearing and seeing things whenever I try and sleep, it usually happens that when I try to sleep. This had happened to me last night, I feel asleep at 2 which is pretty early for me and then I suddenly woke up again in the middle of the night very tired and I could hear people moving in my room and a shadow of a hand appearing above my wall, when I managed to turn myself around I felt like I was falling back asleep but then I suddenly saw cats above me staring at me with very big green eyes and then from there I acc fell asleep. This has happened to me a couple times and it sucks! Cuz when I wake up I'm not only from sleeping at my usual late times but also because I keep waking up and seeing shit haha
Signal	Has anyone experienced lying down in bed for several hours without sleeping? That happened to me tonight. I went to bed at 12:45 am and I tired my best to fall asleep. I kept my eyes closed and my room pitch dark. I finally got out of bed because I was starting to get hungry, I couldn’t believe my eyes that it was almost 5 am and I didn’t sleep.
NotSignal	I’ve known for a while that I’m a Wolf Chronotype (energy peaks in the afternoon and evening) From around 10am-4pm I feel balanced without food cravings. Then gradually from 4pm onwards (peaking around 1am) I- crave sugary/fatty food- become very excitable / obsessive / motivated but without sense of perspective, which drives me to stay up late. Could any one shed any light on the neurochemistry & biology of what is happening in my body and give me some understanding of what to do?
Signal	For a few months now, I have been sleeping around 6am and waking up around 12pm or 1pm. Even if I exhaust myself, there was no way I could sleep sooner. I felt tired to my very bones but couldn't sleep sooner. I had tried everything. A few days ago I had very painful periods cramps. It was so painful that I didn't want to exist. And just like that, I drifted to sleep at 10pm. I woke up at 2am, listless and in pain. I had no pain killers and I couldn't sleep until after 7am. I couldn't sleep enough.For the past four-five days, I have been sleeping around 3am and waking up at 8am. I haven't gotten enough sleep. I have just cut down on caffeine entirely. I hope I sleep sooner tonight./rant
NotSignal	I've seen lots of people recommending it, and I have googled it and I've seen it comes in various forms such as capsules, e-cigs, etc. I've been struggling with insomnia since I started antidepressants back in December, so it sounds like something worth trying. But I don't really understand how it works. Can someone explain the basics to me, and the best form to take it in? Also any positive experiences would be great.Thanks in advance 😃
Signal	So this is a update to the post I made 3 days ago. After not being able to sleep for 2 nights due to the side effects of Prednisone I stopped taking it. I still couldn't sleep on the 3rd night so at 2 am I had the hospital contact ENT for me. He told me to take melatonin. Went to the pharmacy and took 5 mg. Was able to sleep for about 3 hours but woke up every 40-45 min. Spoke with my primary physician next day. She told me to try a higher dose of melatonin to see if I sleep better. Tried 10 mg. Slept for 1 hour, got up, was up for few hours then again slept for 4 hours. Same experience woke up every 45 min. Spoke to my physician again. This time she asked me how do you feel when you wake up? I told her that I feel like my heart is beating very fast and very loudly and I am drenched in sweat. She told me that means you are having panic attacks in sleep. The two nights of not sleeping has cause my brain to be afraid of sleeping to the point I get panic attacks by sleeping. How messed up is that. She gave me trazodone. Tried 25 mg last night. Slept 7 hours but again with waking up every 45 min. No obvious side effects. Since I already have a sinus issue I can't tell if it gave me stuffy nose or my heavy head/headache. This time I was much calmer when I woke up. Maybe because I knew what was happening and that I was not dying yet. I am going to try 50 mg trazodone tonight. Lets see how that goes. Whole last year I used to get back from office at 5:30, sleep for 1-1.5 hour and then again sleep from 11 to 7 like a dead man. I hope I will be able to get back to that kind of sleep some day. If anybody has a positive experience about sleep anxiety I would like to hear about that. Thanks for reading!
Signal	I have not been able to fall asleep from the anxiety that the pandemic is causing me. I have never in my life woke up past 2pm and now I'd consider that an early start. Is anyone else having similar issues?
NotSignal	I just started cbt-I yesterday with a sleep doctor. I am on a sleep restriction. Sleep at 1:30 wake up at 8am. Today I thought I was going to sleep really well, but I ended it getting an hour or less of sleep. It’s just that my anxiety takes control of me at night. During the daytime I’m good most of the time, but for nights since it’s so hard to control your thoughts when you’re very drowsy, my anxiety just takes over and my hearts starts racing and ruins the whole night. I could’ve easily slept more but I stopped myself to stay on sleep schedule. Any tips on how I can deal with this issue?
Signal	Hello all!I’ve never considered myself to have problems with sleep at all. Honestly, I loved sleeping and was always the person that could fall asleep at a concert or in random places within a couple minutes. I’ve never been one to be afraid of the dark, either. Well, around two weeks ago I had done magic mushrooms for the first time. Though I’ve done psychedelics before, this was insanely different and an awful experience. I had extreme ego death, breaches of reality , and every time I closed my eyes I would still experience visuals and odd feelings that were just plain scary. After this experience, I’ve found it extremely difficult to sleep. I’ve gotten maybe 3-5 hours of sleep every night since then.I used to sleep in complete darkness with a fan running.Nope, not anymore. I need the TV on and playing something overly wholesome, like a cartoon. I’ll try to close my eyes and everytime I feel like I’m on the edge of sleep I get ripped out of it. I’ll open my eyes and see a lot of snow, and last night, for the first time, I experienced auditory hallucinations when I was waking up. It kind of feels like I am constantly in that between-sleep-and-awake dream state. I’ll constantly wake up every 30 minutes to the hour.However, it seems like in the morning or daytime I don’t have as much as an issue. I can take a prolonged nap pretty decently.Honestly it feels like my brain is afraid to have my eyes closed for a extended amount of time, like I’m afraid of what I might experience.Anyway, the world of insomnia is entirely new to me so I wanted some recommendations on where to start. It seems like melatonin is the go-to, but the side effects of nightmares and my insane fear of sleep paralysis holds me back.Anything that may help? Thanks so much!
NotSignal	I slept 30 mins before going to bed on the couch as i’ve been doing for the past 3 months and I always have dreams during this short period of time idk why and tonight this dream triggeted me in some ways and I just can’t fall back asleep. I went to bed at 1am. Tossing and turning. I looked at the time thinking it’s maybe like 2 am, but no it’s 3am. My fitbit registered that I was asleep for 2 more hours but I doubt I was and the graphics are too clean and regulars for me to have been actually asleep. fuck me. I hate this cause i’ll be stressed out tomorrow to actually fall asleep and get a bit of rest.I’ll probably go back to my bed in 5mins and continue to breath in and breath out till 5am and then i’ll watch a show on Netflix. If tomorrow turns out to be another sleepless night i’ll go crazyyyyy .
NotSignal	Hello everyone, I hope you are doing good.We have created a WhatsApp group for meditation, exercise, self improvement and to listen each other, we also talk about our daily life and other stuff. If anyone is interested into joining, just text me and I will add you. We have people from around the world ( 80+ ) and is quite helpful. Have a nice day/evening/night. :)
NotSignal	I can’t sleep My parents don’t believe I have insomnia and down play itI don’t know if I can contact my doctor since carona I’m only 15 and I feel desperate. I’ve always had insomnia but never this bad before I’m having a hard time thinking I’m self diagnosed Please help
NotSignal	This has never happened to me before. I just stay awake thinking about stuff. My brain just won’t shut down. I’m not sure if that’s linked to the fact that I’ve been feeling kinda depressed for a few months now. I only manage to fall asleep by listening to some sounds I find relaxing (rain sounds and things like that). I used to listen to those sounds even before having these sleep issues, but I did that in order to relax.What can I do? Thanks for the help.
NotSignal	Welp, I’m an idiot. Was on autopilot and took a VYVANSE instead of Melatonin... Tried to make myself throw up, to no avail, so here I am.
Signal	So I've had insomnia for about 7 years now. Usually I switch off between benadryl, melatononin, Nyquil (sick or allergies) or indicate CBD cannabis edibles. I'm sick with Pneumonia and looks like COVID too so I can't go order or buy Cannabis and I can't work for two weeks so I need to buy something cheaper. I have insurance. Benadryl doesn't work half the time and makes me anxious and grumpy, melatonin gives me nightmares and Nyquil either doesn't work / gives night mares. I take Ativan for anxiety but it will only let me sleep for 2.5 hours. My NP just gave me Trazadone today. What can I expect? Does it work? Any other meds you've tried that help? I can't take Ambien cause it gave me hallucinations and make me puke and sleepwalk and sleep-text people lol. Please give me some advice (and yes, I'm in therapy, I've tried yoga/ meditation/ supplements etc...) :)
NotSignal	Im not sure if this is the right sub, but whenever i try to sleep (even when im tired), i cant if its too dark. This is a recent problem that appeared on me, i dont know what happened to cause this problem. I used to sleep peacefully at the dark and in silence. Now, i only can sleep if i have my TV on. Whenever i try to close my eyes, i just see some shadows moving and if its too silent, i start to hear little things. This will cause me insomnia, because I need to do other activities to distract from that (like eating, going to phone, etc). Im curious what would happen if i Just go stupid and turn all of lights off (even if im scared) and test my fears with my eyes closed to see how much i can resist. Will I go insane and hallucinate? I used to get sleep paralyses, but not anymore. What can I do to sleep peacefully at the dark and in completely silence? This is really causing me insomnia lately.
Signal	For the last few weeks, I've been going through a terrible bout of insomnia. On average, I'm getting around 3 to 5 hours of sleep a night, sometimes even less. I'll stay awake for hours, usually going in and out of a very light sleep. More recently, the mere thought of going to bed has filled me with utter terror. When I get into bed, my heart starts to race like crazy, my breathing increases, and my mind starts to race. I want to sleep so badly, but at the same time, the thought of going to bed makes me want to puke! It also doesn't help that I'm a night owl. Even before my insomnia, I would stay up until four or five in the morning, usually getting up between twelve and one. In recent weeks, however, I'll often toss and turn until around eight, nine, or even ten in the morning. I'll then wake up between one and two in the afternoon, feeling groggy and depressed. Every so often, I will manage to sleep well, but I can never do it consistently. Thus far, sleep hygiene hasn't worked. What can I do?
Signal	title says it, but has anyone else experienced this? i take Diphenhydramine almost every night because it’s the only thing that helps me sleep but when i’m just starting to close my eyes to try to sleep, but still completely conscious i hear weird noises. it sounds so loud like someone loudly talking directly into my ear or beeping and random machinery sounds. sometimes i hear full sentences of total nonsense and it’s just so annoying when i’m trying to fall asleep. the second i open my eyes the sounds stop. i’m not crazy right??
NotSignal	Fell asleep so good just before midnight and now I'm wide awake. Been awake since 4. Might as well just get up, because if I go back to sleep now, I'm gonna sleep through my alarm clocks. Anyway, how is everyone else sleeping tonight?
NotSignal	I just feel like the only way I’m tired is if I was up almost all night the day before. It’s 11:20 now and I gotta get up at 5. Yet I’m not tired and feel wide awake. Gotta love it!
NotSignal	I have been trying to sleep since 8 pm, and it’s another night that I can’t. So I will just start the day. I have a morning workout and then work... so here we go.
NotSignal	Hey everyone. Looking into CBD oils because I am desperate to stop my anxiety-ridden all-nighters once and for all... I just want to know what it's like to feel well rested for once haha. Anyways, I'm looking into CBD oils and I want to know what exactly I should be looking for. Looked online but majority of them seem like paid advertisements.. If any of you have recommendations that would be awesome as well!
Signal	I've had on and off insomnia sense a very young age. When I was younger it would last a couple days then back to normal. When I was pregnant my insomnia came back but melatonin helped with it. Now almost 5 months after having my baby and not even 50mg and a couple shots will make me sleep. There's been no new stress in my life, baby has been sleeping through the night for a couple months. I'm on depression, anemia and anxiety medication as well and the big side effect is drowsiness for 2 of the meds. I'm going crazy with not being able to sleep.
Signal	I have an exam due soon. But not sleeping fucks with my brain and I can’t concentrate on the work.I have about 3 sleepless nights a week. This fucking sucks.
NotSignal	I don't want to brag about it. But I actually feel really good now!Things I've done yesterday:- no TV- Meditated for 30 minutes- Took magnesium- did some stretching massaging for my neck and jaw- went for a 1.5 mile walk in the eveningLet's see if I can keep this up!
Signal	I've been dealing with insomnia for the last 3 years. its much better than it was when it started which I'm thankful for but i still have some bad nights. going on a week of mild insomnia now and i feel like the main culprit is my knees hurting no matter how i lie down. i have to shift all night. this is a problem for me most of the time but the last couple months i actually wasn't feeling any pain and sleeping so much better. i attributed it to a new bed, but the pain is back so clearly that wasn't it.
Signal	I realized that most of the posts I am reading here are from people who are worrying about something. That's what keeps you awake. No, you're not gonna die. I mean, we're all gonna die, but you're not gonna die RIGHT NOW because you didn't sleep for a few days. It usually takes more than that to kill you. Anxiety is something that is manageable. It takes a lot of time, patience and courage and some people may never be able to manage it. But IT IS possible to manage anxiety. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder a few years ago following an energy drink overdose. Yeah, I overdosed on Rockstar Energy Drinks. I nearly died. I had arrhythmia for a while, was on a lot of fucked up medication. Today, I am (somewhat) healthy. I eat healthy, I exercise, and I sleep better, but I do have insomnia still, but nowhere as bad as when I was recovering from this. I remember being the whole month of June 2015 awake. I just couldn't sleep. I was awake 24/7. I started reading on the internet if it was possible to be awake this long. I was conscious the whole time. I had lost a lot of weight. (from 175 to 128 pounds). I was so scared to die that I changed my diet for egg whites and vegetables and water because I believed that anything wrong could make my heart go nuts. You guys need to find sources of relaxation. Meditate is good thing. Listen to relaxing music on your phone with good headphones. That's a good start. Meds are bad, I quit benzos and other meds cold turkey even though I could have died from withdrawing this quickly, but at the end of the day, nothing beats natural remedies. Exercise, Meditate, Relax. Have a pet dog, have a hobby, have a safe relaxing zone where you can be alone. Stop worrying.
NotSignal	Will trazadone work the night I take it? Or will it take weeks to kick in?
NotSignal	Almost certain it’s paradoxical insomnia cause last time I looked at the time it was 2:10am and when I checked again it was 6:40am and the sun was starting to rise... However I can’t rememeber dreaming. Plus I can’t find any signs on my body that i’ve slept so maybe I just rested and didn’t slept?
NotSignal	In that experience I was not thinking of covid, global warming, politics, etc. There was no emotional content in what I mentally wrote and I am pretty sure that was useful in helping new sleep.Has anyone tried this?
NotSignal	Is this legal to purchase online? I am guessing not.
NotSignal	I recently developed poor sleep from stress I'm guessing and it's pretty horrible.i used to not sleep for two days in a row but now I stick to a schedule, meditate and take zinc, magnesium and fish oil and I have no problem falling asleep however I only sleep 4 hours and wake up at the same time at night.any tips how I can continue my progress to add 4/3 hours extra? I'm also adding CBD to help my body regulate hormones as it's amazing for that (cannabinoid system).
Signal	My insomnia is so bad I withhold from taking a pill for my horrible anxiety because the anxiety keeps me awake. An Ativan or something, it would be lights out....At least for 3 hours and then I'll go another 24 hours with no sleep no matter what I do.
NotSignal	Hi guys, I really love this community because it makes me feel less alone (even though I wish for us all to escape it). Personally, my biggest fear with insomnia is that it will take away all chances of being able to live a successful and happy life (catastrophizing, I know. I wish I didn't do it so much). Is there anyone here or do you know of anyone with chronic insomnia who still manages to lead a relatively successful life with regards to work, school, family, social, etc.? Just looking for some hope, thank you.
Signal	I fucking hate bipolar 😂😂 It’s 2 am, i can’t sleep, i can’t eat, cause my thoughts are racing so badi’m on a shit ton of sleeping pills but i’m still not tired at allidk what to do anymoremy parents are gonna get mad that i didn’t sleep, and they’ll start doing things like taking my phone away
Signal	Hi all! I’ve been taking trazodone 50mg for about a year to help with sleep issues. It really seems to help, but it definitely does a better job when I take it nightly. I’ve read online that it isn’t great to take when you’ve been drinking, so I typically skip a dose when I’ve had anything to drink. I was wondering if I should continue to skip when I drink? Because it’s more effective when I take it daily, I hate to miss a dose. Have any of you experienced adverse effects to taking trazodone after drinking? I don’t drink every day but do tend to drink more on the weekends. Thank you!
NotSignal	Just a little background, I've always had trouble falling asleep, but lately I've been doing better. I can fall asleep less than 30 minutes after I lay down in bed and put my phone away, it's great. But earlier this evening I wrecked my car after a catastrophic mechanical failure, and I ended up driving into a concrete wall head on. The airbag deployed, and I blacked out for a moment before I stumbled out of my car. All things considered, I could be worse off. But now every time I close my eyes, I see, hear, and feel myself driving into that wall all over again. I can't relax, and I can't put my lights out because the dark is even scaring me now. Does anyone have any advice?Tldr; I was in a car accident, and now when I close my eyes I see it all again. Help.
Signal	I only got 4 hours of sleep in the last two days. I just took a trazadone and im literally shaking cause of this thought. Ive been dissociating because of my insomnia and it’s horrifying
NotSignal	Just a little vent/looking for some support...I was doing really well with my insomnia until the positive cycle was broken last night by another "episode" even though I did not change anything about my sleep routine. Really it was broken on Wednesday night when I didn't sleep until 5am, but last night was much worse. I did not sleep at all last night, and had another episode of twitching, shaking, jerking, and hallucinating with my eyes closed throughout the night. Seeing flashes of light, mind racing with nonsense thoughts. I have a neurologist appointment on Monday that I have waited month for, but I didn't want to let my insomnia spiral again over the weekend (one sleepless night quickly became 4 for me when this first occurred), so I went to my primary care doctor about the episode I had. She saw me when this first started happening and she knew the history of how it started, what was going on, etc. She prescribed Ambien temporarily so I can at least survive the weekend and get to my neurologist appointment on Monday (if anyone has any positive stories about Ambien, that would also be awesome). I hope it works. But based on my symptoms and their patterns, she is concerned that I may actually be experiencing partial seizures and/or that I have a tumor on my pituitary gland. In addition to these episodes, I've also been having headaches and feeling pressure on my eyes a lot of the time. Needless to say, I'm a little terrified. I just want answers and to feel normal again.
NotSignal	I stay up every night till about 3 or 4 am. Is this unhealthy?
NotSignal	I think half the reason why I can’t sleep is because I have anxiety and can’t shut my brain down. I have been reading while in bed for about a year now to try and distract my mind from worrying thoughts. I think this has helped some. It’s definitely not a fix all. I still have trouble and have to take some form of sleeping medicine BUT there are days that the distraction is very helpful. I’ll just let myself read until I notice I’m falling asleep while reading. It also helps with the not staring at the clock and getting mad that your still awake, causing yourself to wake up even more. I can’t stand just sitting in bed waiting for sleep. Anyways, some help is better then no help. Just felt like sharing.
NotSignal	I panic and jolt when I can’t sleep, which has been an entire month. Eventually, I can sleep but hardly. I get migraines and I usually manage 5-6 hours of sleep but it feels like I have not slept at all. I’ve just sort of accepted my fate, I’ll probably suffer for this for life or end never sleeping again. I’m tired of panicking and irritating the people around me when I can’t sleep. I’ll just try to rest my eyes (the next best thing) and if my partner finds me dead one day at least I wasn’t causing her to suffer or my family with me!
NotSignal	1. You don't have to but you can close your eyes.2. Relax the muscles in your face.3. Take a breath and put your shoulders down.4. Try and clear your mind by imagine a calming scene for 10 seconds. (alternatively, think 'don't think' over and over for 10 seconds.Sometimes you get to sleep shortly after that, and other times it just calms you down and makes it easier to sleep later.
Signal	Cross Referenced from my post in another sub. \*\*So, I've been dealing with insomnia for a quite a while. I've tried every supplement I could find including melatonin, valerian root, etc. In my experiences I've noticed that vitamin and mineral are peculiar and mysterious. It's hard to figure them out, for example;\-5000 IU of Vitamin D, leads to nights of waking up fully alert and unable to sleep. Vitamin D from from the sun doesnt affect my sleep at all\- Magnesium Glycinate of any dosage seem to produce great sleep sporadically, other times it produces insomnia. On top of this, it always produces severe anxiety, so I stopped it.\- Magnesium sulfate (oil spray) helps with easing off to sleep. However it may play a roll in waking up in the middle of the night, fully alert and unable to sleep.\- I've recently increased my uptake of calcium via milk , yogurt and cheese due to a broken bone. Prior to this injury, I eliminated dairy from my diet. This change in foods consumption doesn't seem to play a role.All things considered, if these vitamins and minerals affect sleep there must be some sort of sliding scale that dictates the effectiveness of the nutrient intake. In essence, take more of this supplement and less of that. I just cant figure out the correct dosage. I'm seeing a sleep specialist to work on other possibilities for insomnia. So from a supplement perspective, what do you think?
Signal	I've always had issues with insomnia, but growing up it was always blamed on the cell phone. Somehow a psychiatrist managed to convince my mom I must have had a second cell phone keeping me up even when they took the "first" one away. This lead to me being misdiagnosed and ended up taking trazodone and Seroquel, both which would knock me out but make me feel super sick. If I didn't get to bed right away, I'd be dizzy up until I fell asleep. Also, I'd stay groggy for hours after waking up. I've tried melatonin, Benadryl, a few other sedatives, and nothing seems to help. Lately, I've been feeling this crazy feeling of something crawling out from under my bed and grabbing me. I just feel terrified. It all started when I was laying down on my side, and I swear to God I heard my bed creak and it sink right behind me. It's been days since that's happened, but Everytime I am starting to fall asleep, I feel the bed move, or something causing the bed to sink near my body. It's freaking terrifying, and it sucks cause the only way I can get comfortable is sleeping on my side with my back facing the rest of the room. I've tried nightlights, soothing music, etc. I'm just trying to sleep, man. Any suggestions?
NotSignal	I haven’t slept in i think 3 but i don’t remember days too much. anyway, my boyfriend keeps telling me to go to urgent care but i feel like it would do much help. what could they do? give me a pill and send me on about my day. I might sleep for a night but it won’t fix the problem. plus i really don’t want to go to any doctors office in the age of COVID. it would be nice to sleep though. it’s getting hard to i guess preform actions, and i’m becoming, like my movements don’t make sense. Like right now it’s 1a.m and I for whatever reason i thought it would be a good idea to get up and derangement hair. i put a huge glob of conditioner on my hands only to remember that my hairs in braids and it doesn’t need to be detangled. stuff like that. i also can’t swallow anymore (i managed to eat 7 saltines today.) and my necks getting real stiff too. idk , just feels like my bodies shutting down and i can’t get a grasp on it.
Signal	All my life I've had insomnia. Usually worse during summers when I'd stay up several nights in a row. My mom tells me doctors used to give me sleeping pills as a baby cause it was that bad (just post-USSR). The past 5 years I've used all kinds of sleeping pills (and drinks) every night. Sometimes they don't even work. Tried suicide several times and failed. Nobody will see this but whatever. I want to sleep. Just let me have a good night's rest.
NotSignal	When we first met, I used a white noise machine. She couldn't sleep with it, so I switched to Hearos ear plugs, which worked well for years. The past six months or so, her snoring has gotten really bad. Some nights, I have to sleep on the couch (maybe once or twice a week).I just tried Amazon's Echo buds because they have noise cancelling (I also played white noise through them). But they were super uncomfortable to sleep in, didn't cancel as much noise as the ear plugs, and when I laid on my side, they would start emitting a loud whistling sound.I'm looking for other options. Was wondering what you all used.Thanks!
NotSignal	Black seed oil has numerous testimonies of people saying it cured or helped treat their insomnia, along with being anti cancer anti imflammatory immune system booster, anti fungal and anti bacterial. You have to get the potent kind, amazing herbs and bionatal makes the best black seed oils
Signal	I’ve read medication tolerance is a major issue among a lot of insomnia sufferers (and I struggle with this too). Has anyone tried finding a number of medications that work for you and alternating the nights you take them? I’m wondering if this would prevent tolerance formation if they are drugs with a different mechanism of action.
NotSignal	1) Do you recall dreams or not and how frequently do you recall said dreams?2) Do you still feel energized throughout the day physically but mentally exhausted?3) Do you feel weird when you wake up like somethings off and that goes away after awhile?Just want to see if other people are like me because I don't dream or at least recall them anymore and haven't for awhile. I also feel energized physically I walk 25k steps a day and whatnot yet I can barely think straight or write coherent sentences due to like severe brain fog. I also feel weird when I wake up like I woke up from a light sleep despite thinking I slept from 12 to 6:30am
Signal	I'll try to keep this not too long. I have to be up at 7 a.m for a stressful job and i'm terrified of not falling asleep. I've been on 30 mg mirtazapine and trazadone but I broke the pills into small pieces which i'll ingest one small piece of because I heard 7.5 mg is the magic dose. I remember the days of getting sleep naturally. I remember periods of time where I would OVERsleep for christ sake. Not recently though. About two weeks ago I went a night without sleep, and since I didn't have to work the next day I didn't care too much about it. I hate the feeling of getting no rest so I shut my blackout curtains at 6:00am because the suns coming up and kept eating melatonin gummies and doxylamine succinate (maybe that was causing a reverse effect?)When the 2nd night of no sleep came I begin to seriously worry. I remember all I could do is lay in bed on youtube watching shit that I was not at all even interested in while experiencing adenhonia (i think thats the word - lack of joy/extreme boredom) so I stayed up the whole day basically just trying to get a full nights rest. It never came.By day 3-4 my face became completely colorless. I looked like a ghost. I kept trying to contact drug dealers trying to get some thing to knock me the fuck out to no success. I began feeling overly paranoid and when I would get up to leave my room the thought of turning my door handle and leaving the room gave me the most intense anxiety I've ever had. I decided to go to urgent care because I dont have a doctor (just got medicaid) I asked for trazadone, but they gave me about 10 .25 xanax which I thought would SURELY work. They kept trying to test me for covid and I freaked out because I didn't want to know if I had it and finally they let me go. I mixed the xanax with alcohol and fell asleep... only to wake up 15 minutes later. On day 5 it felt like my mind was tired but my body was awake. I kept falling into an almost sleep but it felt like my body would put itself into adrenaline mode the moment I fell asleep zapping me up into a panic attack. I laid in a dark room all day listening to my favorite radio podcast (the ricky gervais show) and here's a weird side note: I can no longer listen to that show anymore. It's like I have PTSD from this last insomnia stretch and I just can't listen to it anymore.On days 6-7 I started drinking large amounts of vodka but for some reason it just would not get me drunk enough to fall asleep. The last thing I remember is my family coming into my room and me crying like a baby and they had to carry me out to the car. I was taken to the hospital and spent a week in the psych ward. Weirdly enough, when I was there I was given remeron and trazadone and slept like a damn baby. I think its because the room was nice and cool, and only had a bed. No electronics to keep me up. My blood alcohol level was .35 when I got there.Now I'm out and guess what? still not sleeping. I'm always stressed out. I'm there, and I'm not there.It's like what Ed Norton said in fight club: I just wanted to sleep.
NotSignal	If not able to naturally fall asleep within a few minutes of hitting the sack, I've tried the following to work well1/ Getting into a plank position until I start sweating. This usually works in sets of planks so your muscles start to ache and a little perspiration starts to form.2/ A cup of hot green tea with a spoonful of honey. Very soothing and relaxing. 3/ Lavender infused oil steam on my night stand. The smell is soothing and makes me want to stay there on my bed. Question: Have you tried any of these aforementioned techniques? If so, how did it work out?
Signal	I always have trouble sleeping but I don't really think I'm actually an insomniac. Like around maybe 2 times a week itll take me at least 2 hours to sleep but that's all. But tonight it's been almost 4 and a half hours, this sucks! I have plans tomorrow and I'm going to have so little sleep because I feel tired but I just cant sleep right now. Also, when trying to sleep time just flies, I'm tossing and turning in bed for a bit and a half hour just passed, that's crazyy.
NotSignal	Am I able to take zopiclone with a concussion? I’m not sure if it’s safe, and all the pharmacies are closed so I can’t ask
Signal	So after far to many years with sleeping issues (taking hours to fall asleep from ages 15-25 to problems falling asleep and waking up and not been able to fall back again 25-29) I can happily say I think my problems are solved.Unfortunately this is still with aid of a drug but non the less I feel so much better now, I’m happier and actually look forward to night time now.Recently a large part of my insomnia was due to been hypersensitive to the sounds of my heart beating when trying to sleep, the other key factor I believe was just a dread of haveing to sleep caused by years of insomnia, a couple of weeks ago I was prescribed 10mg propranolol as needed and since I stated takeing that (once at night, sometimes once in the day) I now fall asleep quickly, I still wake up after every sleep cycle but thankfully I don’t find it that hard to sleep again and normally get a min of 2, often 3 sometimes 4 or more.I don’t know if it’s because I’m now sleeping like a normal person now or the propranolol but I feel great and just wanted to share what worked for me and to say don’t give up hope.I also take about 0.3mg of melatonin around 8pm as I think propranolol has been linked to effect the natural production of the hormone.Edited the dose of melatonin
NotSignal	I'm too nervous to go to sleep and when I do, I'm only having an hour or two at most before I'm startled awake by a nightmare. It feels like I'm in a cycle since my sleep deprivation is making it worse.I've tried changing where I sleep, making my bed time routine more relaxed and earlier, exercising a few hours before sleep, even burning incense but no luck.Relatable comments and advice are welcome and appreciated.
NotSignal	I had sudden insomnia since the beginning of the year, it worsens in the 2nd week whereby I slept 1.5 hours and sleep 8 hours the next day, and 1.5 hours the day later.During the break near Chinese New Year, I was able to sleep 2 to 3 hours very near to early morning.
NotSignal	I’m not sure if you would classify this as insomnia but I definitely have some kind of a sleep disorder. I cannot fall asleep naturally until 3 am at the earliest. But when I do fall asleep I can sleep until 1:30 pm if I don’t set an alarm. You might think I just have a fucked up sleep schedule, but even when I have to wake up for school at 9 in the morning I will still not be able to fall asleep until 3 the following night.
Signal	Prescribed seroquel for insomnia , was told to take 1 or 2 at bed time , first night I took 1 did nothing to me but gave me stomach pains and a headache, tried taking two the next night same thing ? I've read stories that people would get knocked out by this drug but it seems to barely have an affect on me ? Previously taken ezoplicone, mirtazapine, amateiptyline and trazodone might try and go back to the trazodone at least that made me tired
NotSignal	I just don't know how to sleep. I close my eyes and then do what? My heart is racing after getting 3 hours of sleep in 48 hours and I don't know how to sleep.
Signal	Well since you probably did it anyway I'll make this short and sweet I have nothing else to say except I haven't slept in almost two weeks now and I'm really REALLY fucking tired and angry and sad and I hate myself and my self destructive habits are back and that's it oh and one more thing FUCK I can't do it irl too many old people in the house can't go outside neighbors will hear sorry nevermind I'm just bitching if anyone has any tips which who am I kidding if you did you probably wouldn't be on this sub they'd be appreciated
Signal	I haven’t slept for days and I’m just so exhausted
Signal	Today, after almost a year of waiting, I finally have an appointment in a sleep lab. I will probably stay here for two nights, and hopefully I'll already have the diagnosis Tomorrow. I really really hope that this will help me. This is my last piece of hope, so wish me luck
Signal	I was once prescribed ambien for my insomnia, but lost my script after becoming addicted to benzos. Now that Im off benzos and probably wont get a new ambien script, Im gonna have to ask for something new. Which meds have you guys had good experiences with other than ambien?Just found this sub and its way too relatable
Signal	I think i have been experiencing insomnia for the past few weeks, falling asleep takes me 3+ hours and I constantly wake up, averaging 2 or 3 hours a night. It's fine during the holidays because I haven't got anything that needs my undivided attention, but now school has started and I can't focus on anything for longer than 20 minutes. I don't want to rely on caffeine too much because I think that will totally eliminate my ability to fall asleep at all. I haven't dealt with this before in such severity.
NotSignal	Okay look I need a thought to hold onto to fall asleep. Happy and neat thoughts don't always work out. So I cling to a memory in order to fall asleep. Doing so traumatizes me. How else can I fall asleep.
Signal	i have been prescribed hydroxyzine and seroquel and NEITHER help me fall asleep/ stay asleep. i feel like i’m going crazy.
Signal	Hi, I've struggled with sleeping in a healthy manner my whole life (stayed up too late reading, didn't want to "shut my brain down" to fall asleep, scrolling through social media before bed, etc. etc.) Within the past two years I felt as though I've gotten my sleep habits to a better spot. I'll still never be a morning person but willingly putting my phone/book down and a skosh of melatonin has helped me fall asleep at a semi-decent time.For whatever reason, these past two weeks both my partner and I have been waking up for no reason in the middle of the night and haven't been able to fall back asleep easily. We are both somewhere in the middle of the Light Sleeper to Heavy Sleeper spectrum, a loud or sudden noise will wake her more than me but when it happens it usually requires a roll over and we're back to sleep. However for the past two weeks, we both have been waking up anywhere from 3:30-5am and just being wide awake. It has happened quite literally every night, including weekends. I don't know what to do and I've never heard of this before. I'm exhausted. Once or twice we could blame it on the neighbor (she loves falling asleep to NCIS? that opening song bumps lol) or the cat, but after two weeks of just waking up to nothing and not being able to fall back asleep I'm getting to my wits end. I can still get probably 3-4 hrs of sleep a night, but I was doing much better at 6-7. I can't figure out what could be causing this? There's been no new additions to our usual routines, no new medications/prescriptions, etc. It just started happening and it hasn't stopped.Has anyone else experienced something similar? I've tried upping my melatonin dosage (from 3mg to 6mg) but I think that just puts me to sleep faster and doesn’t keep me asleep. I don't know what else to do since our routine was good before and during all this.
NotSignal	Lack of sleep is killing me. Going on 2 hours today. Help me! Tips tricks anything please
NotSignal	I JUST FEEL LIKE SCREAMING!!! IM SO FUCKING TIRED I WANT TO CRY MAN WTFFF
Signal	I have serious anxiety and can’t fall asleep. I obsess about how much hours do i sleep and it gives me more anxiety. I haven’t properly slept for weeks now today was really scary I fought hard to fall asleep but woke up three hours later and I can’t fall asleep even though I controlled my anxiety. And the next day i feel so broken my head would be pounding with pain and i feel scared to go to sleep knowing that this will repeat again. Tried sleeping pills but makes me feel even worse willing to try anything now please can anyone help me? I desperately need it i am even at a point of contemplating suicide.
Signal	I’ll preface by saying that I take Adderall (immediate release; lasts only about 4-5 hours) almost every day (usually twice a day when I do). Due to it’s strong, stimulating properties, if I take it too late in the day (around 7PM or later) it will almost always keep me up all night. Today I took only one at 2PM. It is now 6:00 in the morning and I got no sleep last night; didn’t even get tired. The Adderall can’t be to blame for this one because that was most definitely early enough to take it.I’ve tried over 50mg of Diphenhydramide (the active ingredient in Benadryl) several nights in a row which helped a couple times, but my tolerance to that is building up, requiring me to increase the dose. Let’s just say I took way, way more than that last night. Like I said though, I didn’t even get tired. I’ve also taken up to 20mg of melatonin, which is 100% useless.So, I don’t know what’s going on or why I have trouble falling asleep at night. If I do manage to fall asleep though, I am out for at least 12 hours every single time, into the early afternoon. Could this be insomnia? Or is my sleep schedule just messed up?
NotSignal	That whole sleep hygiene thing is kinda shit if you think about it, I’d only recommend it to a kid or a teenager. Like, if I put my phone away hours before bed or even an hour I always stay up and wonder “fuck what time is it” but I find using my phone makes me worry about the time less? It’s so weird
Signal	My heart races and i get nervous about not being able to fall asleep. Even though every time I’m very tired and want to rest, I’m just too nervous about not being able to sleep. Any suggestions on how to get rid of this feeling?
NotSignal	Hey all, Since highschool, I have had a very strict wake up time of 5:30 am. I had to wake up the same time as my dad to eat (etc..) Basically, now I always wake up 1 hour before my bed time, even though I have the ability to sleep in, in fear I will sleep past this imaginary wake up time. What can I do to prevent these 5am worries from keeping me up?
Signal	I don't know if this is the right subreddit but, my sleep schedule is fucked, it's 4:44am and I'm not feeling anything. Arround 7am ill start shaking and feeling cold and then ill pass out arround 8am and wake up at 6pm. Its a horrible cycle, my family are hating it and I don't want to annoy them no more.The thing is, the days when I push through that and don't pass out its like I slept 8hrs had a whole hartey breakfast and could run a marathon, at least to people who aren't me, I feel like shit. I want to sleep, I try to I'd purposely go on long cycles and do exercise to tire out so I can sleep to no avail my body no-matter how tired it is will stay up. I haven't had any sleep disorders before, at least not in my memory, my parents say that I used to wake them up at ungoldy hours and I couldn't stop talking about spiders they said I described it like sleep paral3but I don't remember any of this seeing that it was when I was very little.I feel broken, and I'm thinking about seeing a doctor about this cause it's not just bad, it's scaring me.
Signal	So I dont think I have insomia, i just have a hard time falling asleep. It takes me 2-3 hours every night just to fall asleep and even if i take medicines to help me sleep (flu meds than my doctor gave me which has drowsiness effect) I still couldnt sleep fast.Is there any ways or techniques that help you or that was effective in making you fall asleep fast? (Atleast not hours) Im so jealous of my husband, he falls asleep in just a few minutes.
Signal	So i used to go to bed at different times and would be able to sleep when ever I wanted. But then I made my sleep schedule strict for 3 to 4 months and started going to bed from 10pm to 6am. And then after corona scare I went a whole month where i slept anywhere between 3am and 6am on average. Sometimes i even went to bed at 8am. Now that school started up again, even though i don't need to, I tried to go back to a 10pm to 6am sleep schedule and keep waking up 2 to 4 hours later and can't fall a sleep till between 3 and 6am and then wake up late in the day. Any ideas why this is going on? Anyone else struggle with it?
NotSignal	Since i AM adjusting my circardian cycle,going to sleep at around 23:00/00:00/1:00 and getting UP at 9 AM,my brother is doing the opposite,going to bed my morning. The thing is,we share the same Room,we live with my mom and step father and we both are adults. Im 19, he IS 22. Every fucking day he gets on call with his virtual friends playing Rainbow 6 and other games on PC. I have a soft sleep and i take time to fall sleep,and once i fall sleep,even the tiniest noise wake me up. So he speaks with his friends on Voice call the whole night and i don't get to sleep due to that. He screams,hit the keyboard and its impossible to fall sleep. Yesterday i went to bed at 23 PM and i fell sleep at 5 AM to wake up 9 AM. I AM fucking exhaustedThis IS no fucking right,i have tried talking to him,but we end up fighting and he IS stronger than me,so its no use. He says its not his fault If i have troubles to fall sleep and he IS speaking low. I cant take It. My mom doesnt take action,he doesnt realize he was supposed to stay in silence and respect my privacy whilst Im trynna sleep. I AM thinking of going to sleep on the coach on living Room. I dunno what to do anymore,its Just tiresome and overwheelming,because i tried to talk,told him to stop,but he starts acting dissimulated and i always end up as the guilty one.
NotSignal	Last night it all started I was trying to fall asleep and then something jerked me right up from sleeping this happen throughout the night until luckily I got 2 hours of sleep. Now tonight I’m trying to sleep and this tremors comes over me and I can’t even think about sleeping I’m so worried what’s going on I’ve never experienced insomnia in my life and was always a deep sleeper.
Signal	For the past weeks, I’ve been tossing & turning all night, literally. Every night I see hours going by. I know i am sleeping at least a bit because I dream 1 to 3 times but im pretty sure its a very light sleep & that those dreams are REM rebound. I could estimate that I am getting maybe an hour worth of actual sleep (from 10 pm to 7:30 am). The thing is, in the morning, yes I am a bit tired but I don’t have headaches anymore & i’ve stopped feeling dizzy. I am wondering if I might be sleeping more than I think i am or is it my body getting used to very poor sleep?
Signal	12:30 am, and I’m still awake. I’ve been in bed, laying here for over two hours; TRYING to get a decent nights sleep... but I guess it’s not in the cards. My body is absolutely exhausted, but I can’t sleep. I’m so tired that I’m not tired, and it’s really tripping me out. It’s also frustrating AF because this is going on day three of no sleep and I’m just fed up with insomnia. Why can’t I just sleep, what’s so awful about sleeping? I love sleep, so why doesn’t my mind and body love it too?
Signal	LONG STORYI’ve been through a rough bout of insomnia these last couple of months. I was either sleeping 1-2 hours per night or getting a sleepless night. (Sleep on set + maintenance insomnia) All of this because I started to develop sleep anxiety after a sleepless night that I didn’t plan on purpose. So I started to take sleeping pills (Zopiclone) and got addicted to those. Gradually, It got better and better and I told myself I had to stop taking sleeping pills. So I gradually stopped it.After months of anxiety about sleep, I was finally sleeping like I used to for about a month. And I was doing it without sleeping pills :D. I thought this was behind me. But then I woke up in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep and, of course, this gave me anxiety. Since that night. I’ve had ups and downs. I do not have sleep onset problems, only maintenance problems. I “relapsed” and started to take sleeping pills again but only after a bad night. (usually one night out of 2) I am so sick of this bullshit. This time, since my insomnia isn’t as bad as it used to be, I really want to try ACT and stick to the principles in hope to rewire my brain to know how to sleep. BUT i am wondering If It’s okay to take a sleeping pill while doing ACT only one night out of two or out of 3. TLDR ; after months of so little sleep, I think i’m halfway through the recovery road. My anxiety has lowered a lot, but a part of it (fear of sleeplessness and it’s consequences) still runs inside of me. This causes me to wake up in the middle of the night and to not be able to go back to sleep unless I take a sleeping pill. For this reason I want to start ACT but i want to know if its fine if for whatever reason, I take a sleeping pill every two days until I feel confident enough?
Signal	since sunday night i have not been able to sleep at all, i’ve gotten in micro sleeps but never an actual deep sleep. at this point i feel completely dissociated and shaky/nervous. i went to the doctor and was prescribed trazadone yesterday, i took two 50mg pills and still nothing. i had a panic attack in the middle of the night once i saw it was 5am and i still couldn’t sleep. honestly not looking for advice although it’s still welcome, i just wanna hear from someone that this does get better because i feel extremely scared and honestly at my wits end like i can not do this
NotSignal	Any advice how to fall asleep through noisy neighbors and room mates?
NotSignal	I'm looking for other communities that discuss insomnia in an open minded way - preferably somewhere with a focus on treating and overcoming the condition, although I'm happy to join groups that simply talk about coping and dealing with insomnia.
Signal	Sorry if this feels dumb and i know if it’s the right place to ask this.I stay up all night and i don’t feel the need to sleep like at all. I also don’t feel that tired and i mostly have more energy at night.I tried taking melatonine and i started to feel sleepy but then i realised that i also don’t want to sleep and i wait untill the effect it’s gone. I don’t know what to do:
NotSignal	I'm just listening to ABBA, trying to restrain myself from excessive online shopping. What y'all do to pass time?
Signal	Seems like the place to ask such a question.I have had ambien the past, but it makes me trip out if I fail to fall asleep, perhaps melatonin?Anyway, hope everyone gets the rest they deserve…
Signal	I hope this is okay to post here; I don’t have insomnia, but I’m not exactly getting any good sleep, either.Let me start by mentioning that I have MS, which comes along with chronic pain 24/7, making it difficult to fall asleep. They’ve decided to give me Valium for the pain, but the 2 mg pills I have don’t have any effect on me at all. The only time they helped is when I took 5 at once (10 mg) but I felt guilty, like I was pill popping.Being in pain all the time is extremely exhausting, so I do take a lot of naps. My “naps” are usually at least 3 hours, though... I know you’re probably thinking, duh, that’s why you can’t get a good nights sleep. However, even on the days I FORCE myself to stay awake and push through the tiredness, as soon as I lay down, I’m wide awake. It makes zero sense to me, so usually I just give in and take a nap because I know staying up won’t make a difference. My pain gets worse throughout the day, so by bedtime I’m almost always at an 8/10 in pain.But the pain isn’t even my biggest issue. Hopefully someone will know what I’m talking about when I say...I have insanely vivid dreams. All night long, it’s like a continuous movie is playing in my head, and I wake up dead tired. Every freaking morning, even if I’ve slept a solid 9 hours. It’s like my brain isn’t shutting off or something. These aren’t like, lucid dreams where I can acknowledge and control what’s happening; they’re just random, non stop, distracting dreams. My mom says she used to have the EXACT same problem up until a few years ago. I tend to talk in my sleep at least once a week, which also comes with yelling and occasionally hitting my boyfriend (in my sleep, obviously). I don’t think my dreams are connected to things I’m currently worrying about in real life, because they’re totally random and seem to have no connection to any of my anxieties.It sucks being tired as soon as you wake up, especially after a long night of sleep. I’m never not tired. My boyfriend said maybe I should get a sleep study, and I said that sounded dumb, and I don’t need to add yet another specialist to my never ending list. This just really sucks. Does anyone on here have any advice from personal experiences? Is this really worth seeing a sleep specialist for?
Signal	No matter what I do I can only get 4-5 hours of sleep. Sometimes I can go back to sleep after waking up other times I sit with thoughts of falling back asleep. I have very very very very minor muscle twitches. I am afraid its fatal sporadic insomnia I know how extremely irrational but im still scared.
NotSignal	Hello, 4 days ago I woke up very very fatigued , and all my muscle were weak, my both leg, my both arm, all of them were tired, like if i have worked a lotThe next day the fatigue improved a lot and all my muscle weakness disappear, but I still feel my right arm heavy &#x200B;Today the fatigue has subsided a lot but I still have a weakness feeling in my left arm, its heavy, its mainly localised near the elbow I dont think I lost any strenght because I can still do push up without any problemI can still tap on my keyboard very very fast with coordination ( 120 word per minute according to a website)My performance on video game is still the same I can tap 75 times within 10 second with my right hand &#x200B;Can lack of sleep cause this ? im afraid about amytrophic lateral sclerosis, i dont want to die so young, im only 24 , i have project help me please
Signal	after getting diagnosed with idiopathic insomnia, it only took 4 years for my psychiatrist to prescribe me an actual sleep medicine and not some low blood pressure medicine with side effects of drowsiness! yay! but in all seriousness, i would love any input regarding lunesta as i only have experience with nerve pain killers and other such drowsy medicines. nonetheless, after 13 years of 3-5 hours a night, i'm really excited to be starting this! best wishes to all you other sleepless souls out there.
NotSignal	It happens to me like, only a few times a month, but everytime I am really sleepy and I am about to sleep, I turn on my side and it feels like my heart is dropping or sinking. No matter which side I turn to, I cannot get relief from this feeling.
NotSignal	Hi,As far as I remember I make insomnia waves when I barely sleep for a whole week or more. I did not sleep in the Saturday to Sunday night, and even though I think I slept last night I just feel so exhausted and I cannot concentrate on my work.Every time I talk about that to a doctor I got only basic answers : stop screens 2 hours before you go to bed, no coffee in the afternoon, go to bed always at the same time (was terrible advice for me !) etc etc... I am 32 years old, do you think I never tried that ?I know it could sometimes relate with anxiety, when I had a big issues in my personal life I had nights where I could see every minute passing.Tried psychotherapy but did not help, maybe I did not find the right doctor/specialty ? or is that simply a curse I should continue to accept ? Do you have advice for this sweet feeling of waking up without have your first thought being "I'm so tired" ?I would really like to wake up one morning and feel rested, it's probably not true but today I feel like I never had that...
NotSignal	Like, why is this my life? On the times I can get to sleep, if I wake up to go to the bathroom I can't get back to sleep. And right now I'm also having a panic attack for no reason. I've got a panic disorder on top of insomnia so my brain just goes really stupid and like "Hey have some panic". Urgh.
Signal	Does anyone else have severe anxiety before and during bedtime? For me, it happens when I’m getting ready for bed and when I finally crawl into bed and get all comfortable, it starts to spike. I try to fall asleep but every time I begin to drift off I get a surge of anxiety which wakes me back up. I’m terrified of going to sleep now because of this. Does anyone have any advice? I could really use it.
NotSignal	IDK whats wrong with me and its very frustrating and the doctors are useless. Wake up around midnight every night and my stomach is hurting and i have no idea why, even when i try to eat the blandest diet possible. Its not stress cos I minimized my stress and made huge improvements, but the insomnia is killing me. Any ideas?
NotSignal	I’m working on rotating shift and during the day i sleep easily. But at night at 10 pm when i have to go to sleep i don’t sleep until 3 am in the morning. Why ?
Signal	I've had insomnia since a kid and it just has gotten worse as l get older. I've tried I'd say near everything. Doing a lot of exercise, right diet, sleep hygiene, pills, breathing stuff and the list goes on. I've been having nightmares every night since maybe 3y now. I started anxiety and depression treatment two ago. None of the drug mixes the psychiatrist has given me has improved my nights. Only antipsychotics but I felt extremely drowsy all day. Right now I'm on hydroxyzine, pregabaline and melatonin altogether but I only have headaches and when I sleep I wake after maybe 3-4h. The thing is, has any of you been here? What has helped you? Do you still have shitty nights? I'm just getting used to the idea that my life is gonna be miserable every night for the rest of my life. Lol.
NotSignal	Hey guys. I’ve been meditating like crazy. Feel pretty mentally calm etc. as soon as I lay In bed be amount of butterflies and nervousness is so intense. I can’t sleep for a moment. Next day I’ll be ok. Later on in evening feel very sleep. I go to bed. I feel mentally ok. But then I’ll lie awake all night with this intense nervousness again. Should I try CBTi? I’m at a loss. As I’ve overcome a lot of the mental components I feel. Just the simple act of laying in bed tho makes my stomach feel like a roller coaster.
NotSignal	This idea has been in the back of mind for ever since 3 days ago it goes away and comesback every couple months i will get bad insomnia for a week or so its mostly during those time. Im 18F and i have no medical problems that would result in that
Signal	Hi, I’m 17F and I’ve had sleep issues for a long time, at least since the age of 13. Recently, I have been able to fall asleep in a normal amount of time but I have been waking up at 3:30 am every morning. It has only been about five days of this and I’m going to bed early, but school just started today and I’m so tired. Less than a month ago, I was prescribed an SSRI inhibitor for my depression. My sleep was pretty much unaffected, except my dreams are slightly more vivid. It is also on a very low dose, so it shouldn’t have a large effect on my sleep. I don’t think it is the cause.Waking up at 3:30 am was a pattern triggered by when I had a nightmare and woke up in the early morning. Now, I can’t stop waking up at that time. I told my therapist about this. She said it’s just a pattern that I need to break, but I’m not sure. Before it was 3:30 am, it was 5 am, before that it was 6 am. When I’m not waking up early, I’m having trouble falling to sleep. It feels like every time a phase of bad sleep ends, a new phase begins. I get about 3 days of restful sleep before I’m hit with something new.Is this really just a case of patterns in my sleep or could I have a medical issue?
NotSignal	I know you've probably seen this multiple times and you're sick and tired of it, but can someone give me the hard facts of how impossible it is for me to have SFI I'm an 18(M)... Its just my anxiety is really trying to mess up my day, even though last night I got like 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep and then I slept for like 4 more hours... I just can't shake the feeling that I could develop this thing, I'm young and scared and my health anxiety does this too me all the time but this disease has to be the scariest one I've had to deal with by far
NotSignal	Hello your maybe thinking what do i mean by help i need tips for yeah to sleep and stuff at thiis point im gonna be sleeping at day and awake at night like a vampire or bat or something
NotSignal	Been lurking around for quite some time and noticed many people here suffer from bouts of depression and often have thoughts of self-harm/suicidal tendencies. Since It’s another sleepless night, what are some of the ways you’ve thought about hurting yourself/ending it all. I DO NOT CONDONE SELF-HARM/SUICIDE. IF YOU ARE THINKING ANOUT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH ANY OF YOUR THOUGHTS, PLEASE SEEK HELP.Anyway, I’ve always imagined climbing to a really tall building of some sorts and staring out at the vast distance. Taking in everything for a while before taking a leap and ending it all. I can feel the sensation of falling and it is both relieving and terrifying at the same time. I fear death, but embrace the calm silence that will soon follow, as I return to nothingness where nothing can trouble me ever again.This is one of my most frequently reoccurring death fantasies that come up when my mind likes to wander on restless nights. What are some of yours?
Signal	What a sucky cycle. My boyfriend says I should workout to make me sleepier but I pretty much always am too tired or weak because I didn’t/couldn’t sleep the night before. I smoke weed. I read, get away from the screen. I take my clonodine and I’m still awake. I think I’ll call the doctors today and hopefully get put on a better sleeping med, this sucks.
Signal	This past month has been really terrible.. I’ve been to the ER once a week for 3 weeks now. First time was because I couldn’t handle the anxiety and heart palpations, called around 02:30 got diagnosed with depression the Dr gave me only 10 Ativan that lasted a week. I wouldn’t even take the Ativan consistently only after the fact I had been suffering for a few hrs already and it was my last option. I’ve been trying to meet my body and mind half way, started exercising and gave up caffeine. Started mediations and reading about meditation. 2nd week in the ER they prescribe me Prozac, I’ve been taking it for a week.. I know it takes time for the meds to work. With all this though I can’t sleep at all. I got prescribed Restirol but it doesn’t work for me. Dr doesn’t want to give me any Ativan which is irritating because it does work for me it knocks me out without knowing, all I know is that I wake up thankfully. I went to the store and bought some NyQuil Zzz and it somewhat helped me but I still get my anxiety and insomnia regardless
NotSignal	Keep on waking up at random times.24 M. During the last 6 months I can't remember when I had a continuous 8 hour sleep. No matter how hard I exercise the previous day, I still wake up randomly around 4-5 AM and UNABLE to resume sleep. This is fucking up my energy levels the next day. My blood glucose levels are alright.
NotSignal	I’m experiencing a period of jet lag where I consistently am getting tired at 3:00 and getting up at 12:00, but need to start going to bed at around 11:00 to get up at 7:45 starting next week for school. To combat this, I have started setting my alarm for 10:30 for the past 4 days to ease myself into this new pattern. However, the times I am getting to sleep have not been changing for the time I have been doing this, however what has been increasing is my tiredness. Today it hit a high when the night before I got five hours of sleep and for the entirety of today my heart was racing and I now cannot get to sleep since my heart is racing so much. How do I combat this, get my sleep schedule on track, and make sure this heart racing thing doesn’t happen again?
Signal	I will feel myself fall asleep for like 2 seconds (I start dreaming) and I'm immediately jerked away by my body. It happens over and over! What the hell is this. Why isn't my body letting me sleep? I'm so tired. This was happening to me last night and I barely slept and it's happening again. I'm exhausted! On top of this I work a very physical job...It's seriously so bizarre to be tired as fuck but once I fall asleep I'm immediately jerked awake. Sometimes the shake is violent too. It lasts one second. Today I jerked so hard when I started drifting into sleep.It's like my body thinks it's dying so it jolts to bring me back to consciousness. BUT WHY!
NotSignal	My mind doesn't race when I'm trying to sleep and taking deep breaths. But I lose focus after about 1 minute and usually go back into deep thought. Is there anyway I can remind myself to keep breathing deeply while laying in bed? I think I could fall asleep fine if I can always breathe deeply. It usually takes me 2-3 hours to fall asleep. Any help would be greatly appreciated. it's been taking me 2-3 hours to fall asleep ever since I was very little.
Signal	I was prescribed 25 mg trazadone for insomnia. It's been 38 hours since my first dose. I feel like my brain is broken. My vision is slightly distorted and unable to process depth. I feel really sedated and intoxicated to the point where I'm scared to drive. I also have mild tremors. I'm not sure if this matters, but I'm a daily kratom user.Has anyone had a similar experience or can provide me with some insight as to wtf is happening?
NotSignal	So...It's 0406. I have had less than four hours of very light, and also dream filled sleep. I am down on my luck, on seemingly everything in my life, I've had to go back to living with my parents (which is just another huge trigger for me...). We live in a place where the aircon's something isn't fully sealed or fit, and randomly (or maybe not random but I have yet to workout the pattern) it makes a huge fucking generator engine sound. You can hear it in my room more than in theirs. Typical eh? So, I've switched it off, and opened my window. It is getting to a point where it is becoming too hot for it, so one would think getting it fixed is a top priority. I forgot to switch it off for the night (it's too warm in the day not to have it on), which is on me. Parents didn't check. So, loud fucking noises at night. It crept into my dreams an all. Just had one where, for whatever reason (it's unclear), my bro and I were going to prison, and wouldn't see each other for a few years, and while waiting to get taken in (it doesn't appear to be a normal prison, but honestly, I wouldn't know), I hear this effing noise. Everyone hears it. But for me, I need to get somewhere else quick because I'm about to have a full anxiety attack. In my dream! I know also probably in real life, but damn! By the time it stops, and I can come back, my bro is gone. We didn't get to say bye. He left me an sms which I didn't get, and only found out about afterward. That was bloody sad :(Paternal parent has the contact infor of the owner but doesn't want to call him to see about fixing things because he is waiting for the right time so he can hear it for himself. Even though I've told him he can't plan it. So, it isn't getting fixed. I know they were feeling a bit warm because they didn't open their windows, so I thought I'd try and stick it out. Sigh. Poor decisions all around. My headache is worse, my neck is tight (have an issue), and I'm more depressed than I was yesterday. Well done me.
Signal	Hi all, One of the most curious things that has happened to me since my insomnia started is the fact that I have completely lost the sleep inertia stage of waking up. By that I mean when I wake up after I finally manage to get 2 or 3 hours in I suddenly feel very awake and ready to start the day whereas before I would have a slow transition from sleep to full awakening like I would feel a bit groggy, drowsy and would take maybe 10 minutes to get fully awake. Did this happen to anyone else?
Signal	Hello, I suffer from insomnia.I often wake up during the night. It varies from 3-10 times a night I would say. This leads to a permanent sleepy mood and I often have headaches (most times in the front of my head) and a bad concentration. Now I want to try magnesium glycinate and L-Tryptophan. I did not find any normal Magnesium "glycinate", so I ordered magnesium "bisglycinate". I have read that both of the substances I ordered would improve the sleep quality and the deep sleep phases.But now my question is: both should be taken on an empty stomach to achieve the best absorption. So I should not take them together. How would you manage this?I did not find any answers for this.FYI:I am also taking:Ashwagandha powderTurmeric powderVitamin d+k2And sometimes 300-500 micrograms of melatoninBefore that, I had some gadgets at home from the doctor, to watch my breathing, heart rate etc. The outcome was, that I would have sleep apnea. But after that, I was in a sleep labour for 3 times, without a diagnosis. My thought is that my sleep was so light there, that I don't even slept good enough to have a stopped breathing but I think the doctors should have noticed that. They said my sleep would look good. Maybe I just wake up after every sleep cycle. I dont know... I also tried to restrict the bedtime (CBT) without improvements.The last time I felt rested after a good "sleep" was directly after a surgery. I just wanted to go around, I felt so rested but I was not allowed to.I hope someone can help me here.
NotSignal	I always get insomnia with the full moon but I’m feeling this full moons energies extra heavy with the super moon Slept 4 hours Friday night and no sleep Saturday 🌕
NotSignal	Need to get some sleep, ever since starting 1st shift been waking up at 4am but going to bed around 8 with hopes to be sleeping by 10 but it doesn’t work.. Any suggestions
Signal	I struggle with insomnia and have used Ambien with GREAT success for 3 months. However my doctor said it was always meant to be a temporary solution and will not prescribe me anymore. I don’t have trouble staying asleep.. just falling asleep and will sometimes be up for 36+ hours because of it. I don’t necessarily need to take something every night. Looking for something to help me when I’m stressed about falling asleep before work shifts.So, any suggestions for sleep meds I can ask for that my doctor will be more ok with prescribing long term that will help me fall asleep?
Signal	For the past week I've been laying in bed upset and anxious. I will lay there till the wee early morning hours and finally fall asleep for my few hours that I get. All the things that I used to do to help me fall asleep don't seem to be working right now, and I have a doctors appointment set up for tomorrow. My brain used to feel sleepy and drift off to sleep but now I'm having trouble, and every one tells me that it's in my head and that I'm psyching myself out. Is there any hope that this bout of insomnia will break? Before this week I was sleeping fine and now I'm being tortured in this hell.
NotSignal	so the last few nights i haven't slept.The rls are killing me its even in my arms. Im going to the doc tomorrow .What do doctors normally prescribe for this. Ive heard gabapention work's good should i suggest it ? t
NotSignal	Amitriptyline is sometimes prescribed for pain management stemming from arthritis, fibromyalgia, damaged nerve endings, and some cases of unexplained chronic back and neck pain. Amitriptyline was not designed as a sleep aid, but as an anti-depressant and as such has many more popular anti-depressants ahead of it. Amitriptyline is a potent anticholinergics, rarely used as a drug of abuse. However, using Amitriptyline with other medications to treat insomnia such as zolpidem can lead to a "high" or euphoric effects in some people. Trying to get a high off of amitriptyline or any prescription medication is extremely dangerous
Signal	I know the answer to insomnia is not caring wether you sleep or not. I’ve had nights where I literally just didn’t care and slept great. But 98% of nights I can’t seem to get to this headspace because when I don’t sleep, everything suffers. Body aches, can’t think, exhausted. Etc. So, How do you “not care” on a permanent basis?
NotSignal	I usually fall asleep around 2-3 am. 12 am if I’m really lucky but I’m not able to sleep fully. I wake up every two hours. I’ve had this a few years now. I also have nights where I can’t seem to fall asleep until the morning, but those are rare.I’ve been to the doctors before but they can’t really help me. They find me too young for sleeping medications.
Signal	I am27, female, morbidly obese. I've had sleep apnea my entire life, but was only diagnosed and treated last year about 6/7 months ago. By the time I was diagnosed I was having 145 apnea a night: essentially, I hadn't slept more than 3 hours a night for a couple of years.The treatment (CPAP) proved life changing. I could drive again, stay awake in conversations. I was in pain everyday (head, neck, teeth, joints), that went away. I could retain information and regulate emotions better.But, now, I have another problem: I seem to be unable to get to sleep. I will go 3 night or so with less then 4 hours sleep each time. During the day, I'll be fine. I won't even yawn. It's like my system is so used to no sleep it functions on a little. But I want to fucling sleep. I want some fucking stability. I am in a stressful life situation: new job, no family in our city, partner has lost job due to as yet undiagnosed illness (going on 4 fucking months with no answers), 2 kids. Trying meditation apps and most of them focus on mindfulness of body which honestly freaks me out more than anything. I take an anti-psychotic when I feel I need to and it knocks me out for a good deep sleep for at least 12 hours, but I can't keep doing that, I'm worried It'll become the only way I get good, proper long sleep. I dunno. Shit's just fucked. I know if I can control my sleep, everything else follows. I hate that I can't seem to.
NotSignal	Method 1. The Circadian Rhythm Hard ResetTo do this expend tons of energy doesn’t matter whether thats doing a double shift at work or running around till your sweating buckets, this should reset your body and you should start feeling sleepy again. The problem with society these days is peoples mitochondria aren’t producing enough ATP or their producing too much, you want to have it in the so called goldilocks zone just right. This method has worked wonders for me every time I used it. Could combine this method with a forced exhaustion by staying up a full 24 hours.Method 2. The Melatonin MethodDue to our constant exposure to LED light so tvs street lamps computers phones etc our body isn’t detecting proper darkness which is interfering with natural melatonin production so try 0.50 to 1 mg to get refreshing sleep and if that doesn’t work increase your dose accordingly, I recommend combining this with an EEG headband to see which dose changes your numbers. Iv’e always been an objective guy and I like looking at the hard numbers and facts to see if somethings truly working and thats what a self insomnia study with an EEG headband can help with. It can tell you if the gradual dose increase is changing the brain waves.Final Method. The Magnesium MethodSimilar as above except most of us are chronically deficient in magnesium due to monsanto removing it from the soul when tilling the farm lands almost by design and most of us aren’t eating the proper foods to obtain good amounts in our diet most of us probably only get trace amounts. Chronic high cortisol levels and fight and flight anxiety responses also cause us to leech tons of out magnesium out of out bodies. recommend taking the form known as magnesium glycinate and 200mg in morning 200 mg at night, its attached to a glycine molecule which is an important amino acid for higher bioavailability. Also like the melatonin method wear an EEG headband and have a sleep specialist read it over or experiment with these methods in a sleep lab to see if you get good number changes.If any of these methods work for you leave an upvote and comment so more people can cure their insomnia and hopefully get restful sleep back into their lives. Hope everyone can catch some nice zzz’s. One of these methods is bound to work for you.
NotSignal	Cannot remember when was the last time I slept well in the night without Insomnia, and this have worsen as the year progresses. Probably the best was when I am in my teens.
NotSignal	Hi, recently, it's becoming very difficult for me to sleep, despite the fact that sleeping was an easy job before this pandemic. Yesterday, I though that since I would be going to the beach, and get some sunlight, which apparently provides serotonin that can benefit the body, I thought that "Hey, I might get a good sleep tonight," but that was not the case at all. It's 12AM, unlike how I've been recently, I was actually quite tired and sleepy, which I haven't really felt in a while, so I thought that today was finally the day I'll be getting a good sleep. I went to my room, and laid on my bed. Many minutes passed, and I assumed my parents are now all asleep by that time. I tried forcing myself to sleep, laid on my side, put a blanket on my ear as they get sensitive for some apparent reason. They just find sounds that leave me in discomfort. I would also feel pulsating and pressure on my temples, which is another additional discomfort. Still forcing myself to sleep, I began to sweat from the anxiety and unknown fear building up within me as the sensitivity of my ear had sounds piercing through the blanket covering them. My mind was also adding up as it wouldn't stop thinking.I checked my phone to see the time, and it's now almost 2AM. Frustrated, I stared at the ceiling, and I start crying. I just wanted to sleep peacefully, and I swear I felt tiredness just before I went to bed. Still with bits of tears, I try to sleep again as crying somehow caused me to sleep before. But no it didn't.I don't know what time it was even anymore, probably 3AM, and I just moved to where my mom slept, and tried sleeping once again. More time passed by, I continued to sweat, but my ears weren't as sensitive anymore, and the pulsating left, though it definitely took long for me to be able to sleep, truly unconscious. My mind was still quite awake, forcing the sleepiness to depart from time to time. I was finally able to sleep, but I didn't know how, and it was definitely not fun getting there.(Usually, if I didn't go to the beach, my night sweats would've been a lot worse, and my ear sensitivity would be a lot more heightened)TLDR: I thought I was gonna be able to sleep after getting some sunlight (serotonin), but that was not the case. 12AM: I tried forcing myself to sleep for quite a long time,, the sensitivity of my ears increased, finding some sounds,, temples start pulsating, and I begin to sweat due to the unknown fear(?) within. My mind was continously racing as well. More time passed, I cry due to the frustration and try using that (tiredness from crying) to sleep. Maybe at 3AM: i still can't sleep, and I moved to my mom's spot and tried sleeping again. It took a while, i continued to sweat, my mind was still awake, and i didn't know how, but i was finally able to sleep.
Signal	Right now I'm at 300mg of Seroquel, 45mg of Remeron, 3mg of Melatonin, a Benedryl, and some amount of Klonopin.I've tried CBT, CBD, DBT, light therapy, exercise, meditation, sleep journaling (Day 1: slept poorly, Day 2: slept poorly, and so on), Trazodone (eventually maxed it out).Only things I haven't tried are ECT and Ambien, I guess. Don't know what else to do.
Signal	Its 5am I have to be up at 8am and have a full day of classes. Ive been having insomnia since last week and figured today was the night Id finally sleep well. I got ready for bed early and didn’t use my phone before I went to bed ... but yet Ive be up. When I do sleep its only briefly before I wake again so I haven’t been counting those moments as sleep. I know getting through my classes will be rough and at this point I find great irony in the fact my roommate is snoring as I write this post.
NotSignal	Recently recovered from a gruelling 120+ hour episode which I needed to be hospitalized for. I was seeing worms under my skin and kept damaging my inner mouth because I thought hair was growing in my throat and choking me. I’ve never gotten that bad before and was wondering if anyone else had experienced something similar.Fun fact: The first friend I told about this replied with “Jesus Christ, you need to get yourself some melatonin.”
Signal	Mostly feel more awake, just tired, when I haven't slept, and feel more mentall sluggish when I finally catch up. Is it that I have enough energy to feel my depression when I sleep. And just high on the sleep dep fumes when I haven't? It's probably all the dreams/nightmares/broken sleep that adds to the sluggishness aye?I'm frustrated. Every thing a frustration.
NotSignal	Hey everyone, I've been a lurker on this sub for some time and I used to struggle with sleep. I went though a [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-I](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-insomnia)) program with a coach and now I sleep much better.A few sleep coaches and I decided to team up and build an app in our free time to help people struggling with sleep problems. Our hope is that democratizing access to evidence based treatments will be a net positive!We just launched on the iOS app store ([https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleepedy/id1487849164](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleepedy/id1487849164)) and would love your feedback! While the app currently has a one free trial, we'd be more than happy to offer the full program for free for our early users via promo codes.Please feel free to DM me if you'd like to know more :)
NotSignal	I just took Tylenol day pill because I am sick before I went to bed. Now I can’t sleep. Is it because of the medicine or because of my anxieties? It’s been two hours and I have a hard time going to bed.
Signal	Hi every one I’ve been battling chronic insomnia for 7 months now and it’s getting worse. I’m 27 year old female with no real problems in life but this. a while back I was prescribed two different kind of antibiotics For severe sinuses. I remember taking them both and also an aspirin 325 mg. I didn’t realize the aspirin was to high and I’m sure this is what cause insomnia. The same night I had a bad reaction and my body would jump and shake on its own with elevated heart rate and those symptoms went on for 2 weeks and since then I have chronic insomnia where I only sleep 3 hours a night and sometimes 0 hours at night. The Dr has put me on trazadone and it doesn’t help.Any suggestions ? I really don’t know what happened to my body..Dr doesn’t even know It’s getting hard.
NotSignal	Hey if anyone see this and up can you please chat with me I need someone to chat to who understands what I’m feeling.
Signal	I wake up with really bad headaches and a hungover feeling which leaves me completely wrecked all day. These early awakenings occur during unpleasant and emotionally intense dreams at around 6am regardless of what time I go to sleep.I have anxiety depression btw, taking meds for it Thanks 🙏
Signal	It’s like all of a sudden you’re awake and you have to turn on the light. I don’t understand. I’ve tried anti anxiety medication and melatonin. I’m getting off my Wellbutrin cause I think that is contributing negatively to my sleeping patterns. But this is such a weird, random thing that keeps happening.
NotSignal	I wish there was a way to moderate/filter posts that are clearly anxious people (lately seeing a disproportionate number of teens) who are having an atypical day or two where it's tough to sleep or minimal hours.Obviously the only people qualified to answer that are medical professionals, but it is frustrating seeing the term "insomnia" thrown around as easily as it is. I expect some hate towards this post and that's fine, I'm really mostly referring to people who gave it one week and assumed they have it or haven't gone through the first steps of trying to fix things (seeing a doctor, cutting out caffeine, making sure you haven't reset your body clock via a routine, etc.)I don't mean to be callous but it feels like posting on an OCD sub saying "I like to make sure my books are lined up in order by height what do I do am I OCD?"
NotSignal	i twist and turn in bed all night... even when i supposedly sleep according to my apple watch... i never recall it.my doctor said if i wasn't sleeping i'd be dead by now
NotSignal	Broke my foot just over 2 weeks ago. I have to.aleep with the moonboot on until mid April.insomnia due to wearing theboot has finally hit, just as I start uni. I guess there's a bunch of things keeping me awake but the worst part is i don't have anything stronger than paracetamol for the pain that comes and goes.😭
Signal	I have intermittent/situational insomnia and daylight savings has absolutely fucked me this week. I’m confident I got 0 hours of sleep Sunday night and maybe 3 or 4 last night, even with melatonin.Anyone else? Any advice?
Signal	okay so it was all good and i was working my customer service night shift job and i dont know what came first (my resignation or my insomnia) but i resigned from my post and then slowly changed my schedule back to daytime and then during nights when im asleep i would wake up after 5 hours with racing heart and heartburn and then it would spiral into a panic attack because i thought i was having a heart attack or something a week later it persisted and i got used to it panic attack disappeared but i would still wake up 5 hour into my sleep with heartburn so my doctor just prescribed me sleeping aid (ambien) and antacids and they worked for about a week (i slept 7 hours) and then stopped having an effect then i got prescribed another sleeping aid (seroquel) which worked even better than ambien but stopped working after 2 weeks of use so my sleep was back to 5 hours even with the sleeping aids but no more heartburn thou just a racing heart beat and chest pain. Ive tried sleep restriction, meditation , wearing myself out , changing my schedule back to night and vice versa, sleep hygiene and all that stuff and it persisted and progressively got worse (now im only getting 2-3 hours sleep every night) in these past few months (this is the 6th month now)i tried to get a sleep study but it got delayed indefinitely due to the pandemic so now recently i've started to get a constant lightheadedness feeling like im floating or something and light sensitivity in my eyes and some migraines which had me pretty worried.so since i dont snore at all and i dont have a heart disease afaikCould this really be sleep apnea? or just insomnia? and how come it managed to persist for 6 long months?
NotSignal	I'm only able to sleep 5-6 hours before waking up and being unable to fall asleep and this usually happens for a period of 2-4 weeks around 3-4 times a year, my current period being the longest (5 weeks)For whatever reason, the issue eventually resolves itself without any major change in sleep hygiene of day to day life for me and I'm just wondering if any of you guys have also experienced this so I can possibly pin down what has solved the issue for me in the past
NotSignal	Hi friends. Have any of you taken acupuncture treatments to treat insomnia? What was the outcome?
Signal	Hi, i usually get insomnia 3 to 4 time during a year du to school ( studying all night for an exam ) but now i'm working on rotating shift. I work 2 weeks at night and 2 weeks during the day in a month. I started my day shift with no problem but then it switched to night so 6 pm to 6 am. After these 2 weeks of working at night i could not sleep at night when i had to work from 6 am to 6pm. I'm trying to sleep but i fall asleep at 6 or 7 in the morning. I'm starting my day shift now on monday and i know that i won't be able to sleep. How do i get to sleep at night ?
Signal	I got what appears to be 6-7 hours of sleep last night after switching from Trazodone to Lunesta! Hopefully this keeps working.
NotSignal	So, like most of you, if my sleeping environment isn’t PERFECT then I’m either A) Not going to fall asleep B) Going to fall asleep (if I’m lucky) at the convenient time of 4am C) Going to have extremely fractured, spotty “micro-sleeps” that leaves me feeling quite depleted come morning. One thing I’ve found that helps my sleep quality is sleeping in PITCH BLACK DARKNESS. I’ll cut to the chase: I have pseudo black-out curtains but they’re not enough, and the sleeping masks that I’ve tried (3) always seem to escape my face at some point in the night and I’ll wake up and be unable to (fully) fall back asleep because I won’t be able to find them. Does anyone know of any light blocking sleeping masks that hug your face like a 2nd stage xenomorph? I want this bitch to be stuck on my face no matter how much I toss and turn in the middle of the night/early-mid morning. tl;dr badass, FUCK INSOMNIA sleeping masks, anyone?
NotSignal	To start off, I fucking hate ambien. To me, it’s the worst drug ever created. Since I have been taking it I’ve had short term and long term memory issues. I work in Fort Bliss, TX, and my girlfriend and I live in Las Cruces, NM, which is about a 45 minute drive. There’s been a few times in the 7 months that I’ve been on it that I’ve forgotten that I even drove to work. Basically I need help, I’ve tried numerous ways to get a sleeping schedule. A different diet, my phone being put in a drawer, background noise, some supplements and vitamins; none of it works.
Signal	I made a post recently explaining my situation (I’m struggling lots to fall asleep and am always tired-to keep it short) Comments helped me realise this could be due to sleeping disorders such as insomnia and maybe due to other mental health like depression. Anyways, For months it has been like this, my family do not know. I received sleeping pills from a friend, but they don’t really solve my problem in the long run. Getting to the point, for the first time in months due to corona i have visited family and am staying for the night. This is not good for me at all. I cannot manage to sleep, not only have i not been able to sleep anyway but i’m not in the comfort of my own bed which just makes things worse. I’ve never been a homesick type person but it has always taken me longer to sleep when away, but with my problem it feels much worse. Has anyone dealt with this before?
NotSignal	So basically I am torn between going to bed at my normal time (6am-9am which I know is anything but normal) or staying up all night and day so I go to bed at a what is considered normal time and fix my routine.The problem is that whenever I go to sleep at night I wake up after 4 hours, so if I sleep at 12am I will probably get up at 4am and not be able to sleep until the following day.However if I go to bed between (6am-9am) I will always get 8 hours uninterrupted sleep however when I'm awake I feel lethargic.I just have no clue what to do, as I want to make myself a better person however part of me wants to keep to my routine so I dont have to deal with my familys BSAny advice guys?
NotSignal	Hi all for those who have used gabapentin, how do you feel on it? Do you get that brain fog feeling like the next day? I tend to get it on mirtazapine etc. Even benzos feel much more better the next day than antidepressants.Cheers
NotSignal	So the last two weeks i have been waking up 1-2 times a night to pee, and a strong urge to eat. I didnt find it so weird, until last night when i woke up at 3am after a weird and intense Dream. I woke up, sat up and saw some kind of human sitting down hugging his knees. In some way i felt it was my dad or something?It lasted for like 5 secs, and i was utterly terrified. I slept again with the lights on no trouble.I heard its something called hypnagogic hallucinations or something? I’m anxious to go to bed at night without lights, what do i do?
NotSignal	This has really only been going on since quarantine started (March) but pretty much I've been pulling all nighters (or sleep about 1-2 hours) a certain amount of times per month. I sleep perfectly fine 8-9 hours for on average about a week or two and then one night I completely break my streak, then I seem to fall back into a good rhythm.I've tried compensating for this by relaxing before bed, turning off electronics, waking up same time, all the garbage you can find online, and really my issue is psychological because I find myself stressing about sleep during those nights. I've been handling it much better since it first started of course but I'm wondering if this is enough to do long term damage if this happens long enough.Please let me know what you think. Thank you.
NotSignal	I’ve gotten my insomnia to a manageable point lately but I’m always looking to improve. I wake up super early (I teach for VIPKid) and my problem now is waking up before my alarm (like an hour before my alarm) usually anxious about my alarm. I’ve been tracking my sleep stats and my hear rate dip is atrocious. Sometimes my HR is up in the 90s while I sleep. I don’t wake up gasping for air and I don’t always snore (sometimes when I’m sick or have allergies). I don’t feel like I have sleep apnea. I miraculously took a nap today and my HR was lower than during nighttime sleep. Do you think this is due to sleep anxiety? For reference sometimes I drink a glass of wine before bed but last night I did not so it wasn’t alcohol. Nighttime:Avg heart rate: 76Sleep time w no dip: 40%Sleep w 5% dip: 20%Sleep w 10% dip: 40%Nap:Avg hear rate: 70Sleep time w no dip: 0%Sleep time w 5% dip: 14%Sleep time w 10% dip: 29%Sleep time w 15% dip: 57%What could be causing my shitty nighttime HR?
NotSignal	I can see my thoughts so vividly. Idk if I'm gonna even fuckin sleep tonight. I really hope I do but god the vivid imagery is fucking me up. Anyone else experience this??
Signal	hi all, i’ve read through some posts on melatonin here but i still have some questions.some background context: im taking my gcses this year and i’ve always been a pretty anxious person but it’s only february and i’ve found myself wide awake at night, with a pounding heart and racing thoughts about my worries and things i have to do. i cant sleep and it leads to frustration, panic attacks and crying. then it goes on for the week and i sleep maybe 2 hours each night and it impairs my ability to focus on school and my mental health in general.the only time i sleep well is friday and saturday nights. (bc there’s no school the next day) i’ve tried not using devices 30min before bedtime, camomile tea, yoga, breathing techniques etc. nothing works. my thoughts are like a high speed train and i can’t shut them down. the side effects of melatonin are pretty scary from what i’ve read. should i try them out? i really need an immediate solution because i cant afford to jeopardise my academics from the lack of sleep. what dosage should i take? if not melatonin, what else should i do? thank you so much
Signal	No Idea if it's the hot weather or something else, but all of a sudden I can't sleep for the past week at all. I lay there for hours on end and even if I fall asleep I wake up 3 hours later with the same problem. I'm really sensitive to this stuff and I feel like I'm going completely insane. Idk what to do i already have a good sleep hygiene, good diet and I exercise every other Day. I feel helpless, I have benzos at home, but I don't wanna use them everyday. I have absolutely no fucking idea what to do, does somebody can give me some advice please? I'm seriously considering going to a psych ward
Signal	I’ve realized my insomnia is caused by sleep anxiety. Even hours before bed I start dreading it, and it’s the main thing on my mind as I get ready for bed. I get major anxiety about wondering if I’ll even sleep at all that night, and my efforts to counteract this anxiety and calm down don’t seem to work. I’ve seen people say the cure is to “not care how much sleep you get” but I genuinely don’t know how to accomplish this and make myself not care. Help please!!!
Signal	Please help I took hydroxyzine it did work just a lil bit but I just woke up after 3 hours my docter prescribed me Seroquel but I’m afraid to take it because of the side affects like I’m desperately in need for help I don’t know what else to do I’m losing my mind because I can’t sleep and my insomnia has became chronic I’m so scared and afraid someone who ever please help I have sertraline to but I didn’t take it I only took the hydroxyzine and it do somewhat work
NotSignal	“call your doctor if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression, or fear.” then your doctor will tell you to stop taking this drug, throw up her hands, and give up on you. anyone have experience with the side effects of trazodone and did it get better?
Signal	So I have no trouble falling asleep, it takes me from 5 to 15 minutes usually... The problem is waking up, waking up, waking up.. in the middle of the night, constantly. I can assume I have about 3 to 4 hours total of low quality sleep per night, with some bad nightmares sometimes.This is happening since about 2 weeks, when I ditched heavy weed smoking completely. (Weed was a cure for my insomnia that I've developed like half a year ago). I no longer accept relying on weed, because when I was smoking, my life was "on pause" - just gaming and weed, nothing productive besides work.Last two nights were really crushing for me - one with alcohol prior to sleeping (which always made me sleep like a baby), guess what. 3h of sleep and I was done for the night, just rolled in bed for hours afterwards.- Second one - took 2mg of prescribed estazolam , guess what... I've fucking woken up too after about 3 hours. After taking a fucking benzo. This is where I've lost hope. This is soulcrushing. Before weed I was on lexapro for a month (felt so nauseus the whole time, no anxiety, almost no emotions - sorry i don't want to be a fucking emotionless robot, so i ditched that shit.) Also tried trazodone once (0 minutes of sleep this night, straight into trash bin, fuck this "medicine", It's not for me).I've tried melatonin in various dosages, excercising before sleep, reading, alcohol and benzo (estazolam). I keep having the issue.I sleep in a quiet dark room, nothing drastic has happened in my life, like a loss of a loved one etc. Nothing except weed withdrawal comes to my mind, but I really don't want to keep on smoking pot.I consider myself very sleep sensitive person. I went from being extremely pissed off at having only 7h~ of sleep (because my perfect amount was between 8,5 to 9 hours) to a person who due to physical and psychological pain that insomnia does is having suicidal thoughts.What else can I try to make it better? Can anyone relate? I bet a lot of people do, but I really need answers, or a proper medicide or something... I'm willing to try any advice. Help, please.
Signal	So I guess this has or is still happening to a lot of people here so maybe I could get some tips?Like a year ago I didn't really care when or how I'm falling asleep but then suddenly my insomnia started I had one week where I stayed up till 4 and had to leave the house at 6 or 7, after that week I started to get anxious everytime I'm trying to sleep, I even started thinking about it while I was in school.Night-time became pure torture to me and I don't know what to do. In fact , I'm in bed right now and can't sleep, again. I never experienced something like that before but I don't wanna take meds or anything to make me calm. I seriously need help it's driving me insane.
NotSignal	Ive tried listening to some of these apps and videos of with fire/rain/white noise in them. They seemed to calm me down a bit but they didnt really helped me with my sleep.
Signal	So I’ve been having palpitations since July 20th and it’s been bothering me since then. I have stopped with the caffeine three weeks ago and I have stopped the melatonin on August 6th, 2020 after taking it nightly for roughly about 3 years. However, on August 7th at 1 a.m. my heart decided to go and have palpitations again and I had to go to the ER to get checked for the second time. All the results were clean and normal apparently. But I went home and it’s been hard to fall asleep. I don’t know if it’s panic attacks or whatnot but I’ve been having headaches, palpitations, pains in my back and neck, muscle twitches, and sweaty palms. But everytime I’m in bed my heart starts racing and I end up worrying about it. I don’t know what to do and I’m frustrated. It feels like I’m going crazy. I’ve tried meditating but it’s not really helping either. Everyone is attributing it to stress and anxiety. What should I do? I haven’t slept well since last Thursday.
NotSignal	Hello insomniacs. I am your fellow non-sleeper, and what I do professionally revolves around insomnia. I am doing a PhD in Anthropology (in US) and I research insomnia in Serbia/Portugal. In addition to my research I am dabling into public humanities work. The project I am working on with my university is a collection of art sumbissions of any types that revolve around insomnia. It will result in some form of a publication. So, I am inviting you to join this magical endeavor, we would work together as a team and I wil provide you with details and guidelines if you find this interesting and want to participate. Hang in there and let's make something cool together.
Signal	I haven't sleep in 24 hours. I just can't fall asleep. This has never happened before, i dont know what is wrong with me. Im really sleepy my eyes are burning and im really tired but i can't sleep. What should i do? I stayed in my bed for like 6 hours :( i don't know what is wrong with me
NotSignal	I am putting in a Mind Amend sleep song on spotify with a sleep timer. I set the volume very low. On a goodnight this knocks me right out. I believe it will. I believe in it. I've said out loud that I don't stand a chance against it and poof! I'm usually out like a light. I can find sleep in very specific moments and to very specific songs. If this doesn't work I'll be up till 4 or 5am. Wish me luck!
Signal	I fell asleep probably around 8:15, woke up two hours later, got out of bed at 10:30. Sat downstairs with my dog for a bit. Of course took a Doxylamine succinate even though I know I built a tolerance. Tried to go back up to bed around 11, despite being super sleepy, couldn't sleep, then around 11:15 took xanax and then I was able to sleep until like 5:45. It's hard to cut out sleeping pills with a job. I need a couple weeks where I don't have to worry about work performance. But I don't get why I keep trying to take them if they don't worry. Every night I tell myself I'm going to start sleeping with nothing in me and just suffer, but then I break in the middle of the night. I hate myself
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for 3 years and I can’t handle it anymore, I even tried quitting smoking to help get the nicotine out, and even with that I still can’t sleep and that cycle lead me into depression that started to make me smoke again. My meds don’t work and my social life is almost nothing. Bro I can’t tell if I’m awake or asleep sometimes, it feels fake at moments. Doctor says I need time to adjust to my new meds but I can’t focus enough to stay lying down in bed. I’ll lay for around 2 hours minimum and at that point my brain can’t stop, and I need entertainment. So I go on my phone or read or whatever I can do to stop the nasty thoughts. What the fuck do I do, I’ve tried so much. I have a family gathering this weekend and I don’t want to miss it due to this shit, it’s happened so many times. Any advice? (To sleep I must have my white noise machine on and my radio on and have the door closed and locked due to my fear of quietness)
Signal	My girlfriend cant sleep and has been taking ambien for almost a year now and she cant sleep and refuses to sleep without it. She acts and says weird things on it and it scares me. Example, the other night she was afraid she was going to go to sleep and not wake up. She still wakes up sometimes and cant go back to sleep and she'll take yet another one when shes not supposed to. She will also take melatonin, Benadryl, and her anxiety medication, which also makes her extremely loopy. She also drinks on the medicine which I told her I can not be around her when she does anymore because she acts like a psycho person and its terrifying. I plead with her to not drink, and or take all these meds at once but she refuses. I am terrified she is going to overdose one day and I want her to get off the medication completely. I'm not sure what to do here. Any input would be helpful.
NotSignal	This sounds weird but back when I was having severe insomnia, I sometimes didn't know if I was asleep or not, and sometimes I was able to assume so because I vaguely remembered having dreams. Other times, it would feel like my body went comatose but I was still sort of conscious, and this state could last an hour sometimes.
NotSignal	So first one got deleted. Short person. Speach not height. Always up. Had this account for a bit but never thought to reach here. Have local support but in these times they have been difficult and been struggling. Problems compounded here.
NotSignal	I've had these for years as well as I've dealt with insomnia, I broke my ankle pretty bad almost a week ago and it needs surgery. Problem is they cant work on it unless the swelling goes down. I cant get the swelling to go down because of the strong hypnic jerks in my leg at night either irritates, breaks, or hurts the ankle even more. If someone has a remedy solution for the hypnic jerk cycle that gets worse without sleep, please let me know. Or atleast a way to keep the jerk away from my leg that needs rest and healing.
Signal	Lunesta is the best thing that I've tried so far. For most of my life, I would toss and turn for hours in bed, too weak to get up, hopefully getting a few hours of restless sleep after waiting for five or six hours.When I started taking OTC meds, I would still take about three hours to get to sleep. I took Klonopin for a while and got down to about two hours before I could fall asleep. I often had total insomnia, so I was ok with waiting this long if it meant I still got some sleep--and my actual sleep time got up to about 8 hrs.I started taking Lunesta and it is amazing. No groggy feeling; I fall asleep within 30 mins to 1 hr. I can easily read myself to sleep. (I've been reading myself to sleep for almost all my life so I need this as part of my sleep routine.)With Lunesta, however, my sleep cycle is shortened to about four or five hours. The only way I can sleep enough is if I sleep about 11 PM to 3 AM, take another tablet of Lunesta, and fall back asleep again from about 330 AM to 730 AM. I've tried falling back asleep naturally when I wake back up but I rarely am successful. I have also tried separating the 3 mg tablets into 1.5 and 1.5 but these aren't enough to knock me out fully each time.I've also tried doubling up Lunesta with unisom and drinking grapefruit juice. (I used to take an ungodly amount of antihistamines with Klonopin to push myself to sleep.) I like that I can take Lunesta with just theanine and magnesium. So far, Lunesta has been the only thing to help me sleep without needing add-ons to work.I've asked my GP about going up to 6 mg if the doses are taken as 3 mg five hours apart. I'll see what she has.In the meantime, has anyone taken this high a dose before regularly? What were your experiences?
NotSignal	Woke up almost 4 hours ago and my head still feels like it’s a fish bowl. My balance isn’t exactly all there, either. Does this eventually wear off?
NotSignal	and my active mind kicks in for 3 hours until my alarm hits. Advice?
Signal	Looking for recommendations on what to try.The only things that actually work for me are benzos but I don’t stay asleep all night on them and I can’t sleep for a least a day after useing one for sleep. Or ghb but I don’t want to relay on g for other reasons.I have used amitripaline in the past, it worked quite well for a few weeks then stopped working , went from 20mg up to about 50mg but didn’t like the idea of the side effects such as the increase in resting heart rat etc.I take magnesium and l-thymine at night, often use alavender Difuser, tried Charamhile, valerian and a few anti histamines melatonin.Tried sleep podcasts , white noise / rain etc.All these do at best is relax me or make me drowsy but not fall asleep, Looking for any low risk drug recommendations, probably SSRIs other tcas if anti-depression related ,I took Fluoxetine and Mirtazapine for a around 6 month / 3 moth a piece about 6 years ago for a panic disorder, can’t remember the dosages but don’t remember them helping me sleep especially either.Thanks a lot

Signal	I have insomnia but recently its been exhaustion to a point of nearly collapsing on the floor. Usually I get like this after 2-3 days of no sleep, but I've been able to "sleep" for the last several days,restlessly as I'm waking up every couple of hours, this is normal for me though. What isnt normal is feeling like I havent slept in 2-3. Has anyone else experienced or is experiencing?
Signal	I took two tablets and still can't sleep and pulled an all nighter last night, what do I do? Everytime I seem to fall asleep I'm jolted awake with anxiety.
Signal	Hi All,I have never posted on Reddit before, but I know how absolutely awful insomnia can be, so since I found something that seems to be helping me a bit, I wanted to share in the hopes that it might be able to help someone else.I have always struggled with insomnia ever since I was a kid and recently got hit with it to the absolute maximum. I'm talking three back-to-back days of ZERO sleep, then crash for a couple of hours, and start the cycle all over again. This continued and continued and my quality of life was becoming complete trash as I can't even tell you how many sleepless nights I was having. I tried EVERYTHING to help me sleep. Every sleep hygiene technique out there (exercise in the morning, no caffeine, sugar, or alcohol of any kind, no screens at least two hours before bed, hot showers, no eating several hours before bed etc etc), melatonin, multiple meditation apps, reading, sleep mask, ear plugs....EVERYTHING. Nothing helped even 1%.I also had zero success with NyQuil or anything of that sort and so I finally got a prescription from a doctor for Trazodone. Trazodone worked well for a couple of weeks and then BAM, back to staying up all night. Apparently I had somehow built a tolerance to it very quickly. A doctor suggested putting me on another prescription sleep aid but I grew very hesitant. What if I built a tolerance to that one in a couple of weeks as well? Would they just put me on something else? I didn't want to be jumping around from medication to medication and I also didn't want to reach the point where I couldn't fall asleep unless I was on something. It started to reach the point where ALL I thought about was sleep. My sleep anxiety would spike as it grew dark out, I dreaded bedtime, and even started sending myself to bed at 7pm with the logic that even if it took me 10 hours to fall asleep, I would still manage a few hours of sleep. Instead I would just toss and turn all night.One day I was talking to my mom and she said something to me that really struck me: "You're putting too much thought into this." She was right. I was trying to plan my sleep, force it, will it. But the truth is sleep is a natural process and the more you try to force it, the less likely it is to actually happen. her advice to me? "Just go to bed when you're tired. If you're not tired, don't go to bed."That night, I tried it. I would only get into bed when I felt I was ready to sleep. I sat at the table in my room writing and reading waiting to feel sleepy. Well, that moment never came so I never went to bed and stayed up all night. But I didn't get discouraged. The next night I tried it again and this time around 3am I felt my eyes getting a little heavy so I shut them and actually went to sleep. Same thing the next night. And the night after that. It was like the second I stopped obsessing over sleep and just let my body tell me when it was ready for it, it actually happened. That's not to say this method is 100% fool proof. I did have a particularly restless night a few nights ago where my mind was racing and so I stayed up until about 6am, but the difference was that I didn't let myself stress over it this time. I thought "okay, you stayed up until 6, you're going to be tired, but that's okay, so be it." Didn't stress about it, didn't send myself to bed at 7pm the next night to compensate for it, just rode out the day the next day, sent myself to bed when I felt tired, and was back to falling asleep. This next piece of advice might be contrary to some of the stuff you've read and heard, but I actually find watching a movie before bedtime helpful. A HUGE part of my insomnia is that I overthink at bedtime. My mind starts racing and then I get into this headspace that makes sleep impossible. I find that watching a movie helps distract me and settles my mind at night. However, I still avoid my phone — I find this causes me to overthink, wires my brain, and also constantly reminds me of what time it is. So what I do is set my alarm, put my phone away, and put on a movie. Sometimes I fall asleep during the first movie, but if not, no stress — I just put on another one.Anyway, just felt compelled to share because I know the hell that is insomnia and if I could help even ONE person, I feel it will be worthwhile.Happy sleeping everyone!
NotSignal	Before I had any sleep issues I cut caffeine in the form of coffee because I thought it was bad for you but then I started having sleep issues and I started drinking it again then I stopped after awhile and my sleep started to get better while I was drinking coffee. Is it just me or does it seem as if caffeine really doesnt cause exacerbate most insomnia I see a lot of people on here that as soon as they start having sleep issues they go crazy and cut out blue lights stop drinking coffee do x y z in the sleep hygiene handbook and still have sleeping issues or find that it gets worse. It seems like the pursuit of fixing sleep issues can worsen insomnia more than any one or few poor sleep related habits.
NotSignal	Don't mind mejust trying to kill time and negative thoughtsI am real, I do exist. And because I exist I'll eventually fall asleep. It's okay. It'll come to me. Sleep will come. To me and to you as well. *The sandman's coming in his train of cars**with moonbeam windows and wheels of stars*
Signal	Tonight, I've had the worst insomnia I've had for the last 7 years. What happened 7 years ago? Freshman year of high school. This time, I finally have a fresh start for college after an awful academic record, I don't have to pay anything out of pocket, but now the stress is going to kill me 24 hours a day and I am afraid.If this affects my job, I could die... It sounds dramatic. I drive for 40 hours a week, if I fall asleep at the wheel...I need help. I need tips. And if you live in the Boise, ID area, I would seriously love some therapist recommendations because I have yet to meet someone who is not Christian and will not look at me with "those eyes" when I bring up being gay. Everything being online is really not helping right now...Sorry, I'm ranting. Obviously haven't slept... And I know that being afraid of not being able to go to sleep is going to make it harder to fall asleep, but I'm not kidding when I say that for the past 2 years I have slept like a rock. I thought it was over. And my insomnia has not been caused by school since long before last year.Does chronic insomnia just choose a stressor? Does it even matter if I do everything right, if I have one thing to stress about, will it pick that? I didn't even know I had it until I had a long break from it, I don't know what to do..
Signal	I don't know if this belongs here, but I just wanted to post something regarding my sleeping disorder hoping it will maybe help.It's another sleepless night, where I felt tired, put my phone down and tried to fall asleep but my brain said NO! And that's basically my story for the last 5-6 years at least. I had pretty normal sleeping pattern before I started college. I was going to bed around 11-12pm, waking up aroun 6:30-7am to go to school. When I started college, classes weren't starting that early, often they were afternoon or in the evening hours, some day I didn't even had classes. That opened opportunity for going out, staying up late etc.Before college I was also pretty physically active, playing volleyball every day, up until I was 19, but then stopped, from that point up until now (28 years old) I barely did anything physical (just recently I started cycling). Even when I got the job, when I was 23 I struggled with sleep, I was falling asleep late and waking up early, living on 4-5 hours a sleep for years. I lost my job 6 months ago, again having a lot of free time, I started sleeping a lot, but feeling exhausted, I would fall asleep around 3-5am depending on the day, and would wake up around 1pm, feeling even more tired than when I went to bed, and that feeling would countie through the day. I feel slow, tired, lethargic, unmotivated, always feeling I could fall asleep any moment, but when I actually lay down in bed and try to sleep my mind turns on and I start thinking about all sorts of things.I often think about things that I done wrong, even though some of them are really minor things, but I remember them in that moment and they mess up my sleep. I also think about my parents, how they are getting older, how they maybe never had the life they wanted, how I could connect with them more and spend more time with them. I think about my brother who I wish I could guide somehow in helping him finding his path in life. Sometimes I even cry thinking about my family. I also think about times when my heart got broken, recently, last year, by a Spanish student I met on my exchange in Bratislava, Slovakia, not even a single day goes by that I don't think about her multiple times a day, especially at night, when I want to sleep. She is the reason I can't sleep tonight and writing this.I'm also thinking how I could become better, chase for things I want in my life, making my and life of my family better, but I just lack the motivation and willpower to do the those things. Also I have suicidal thoughts more often. I would never do it, I never consider doing it, but that though is just there from time to time, just like me saying to myself "you could kill yourself". I also thought about start smoking weed before bed, because it really helped me fall asleep a few times I smoked it at my friends house, but I feel like it's cheating yourself, just masking the problem, and also I'm not in financial situation to spend money on it.So basically for the last couple of years how I would fall asleep is by watching YouTube or listening to music to the point I'm so tired I can't even think anymore and just immediately fall asleep. Waking up even more tired the next morning. I never spoke with these issues with anyone, because I feel difficult to opening to someone, even to someone as close as my brother and my parents.It would be cool if someone with similar experience would write something, anything, I would appreciate.Also sorry if my grammar is not perfect, English is not my native and sorry for the long post.
Signal	So this is my first post in this community. I've had insomnia since childhood and I'm 40 now. The Dr had to put me back on meds recently. Hes got me taking trazadone which has worked pretty good so far. Although I can tell ita not gonna work tonight. My husband, who never gets sick btw, caught whatever nasty has been floating around with our kids and their schools. I'm a nurturing person. If someone is sick in my home I can not sleep. I guess it comes from being a single mom for so long (we're newlyweds). If my son would get sick id know I was the only one there if he were to wake up and need something so I would lightly doze but not go all the way to sleep. I have a feeling its gonna be a light doze night, meds and all, out of worry my husband may wake up and need something.
Signal	I got taken off Prozac this morning cuz I’ve been throwing up constantly, shaking, weirdly wired like proper awake, for days, I took a 7.5 zop this morning and I wanna go to sleep but I’m not tired, it says one a day but can I have another one tonight?? X I won’t risk it if it’s dodgy, it just didn’t really have the tired effect I wanted
NotSignal	And I'm supposed to sleep at 8 pm, or 10 pm because that's what normal people do. And I only don't sleep because I don't want to.Thanks...
Signal	I don’t know if I’m an insomniac. I can’t sleep. I haven’t been able to sleep- at least not well for over a year. I have always been a light sleeper however it got considerably worse.Last year, after 2 years living in my apartment I was suddenly unable to sleep due to a humming sound. The sound developed in winter. Therefore I suspected it to be the AC unit wires?cables? going through the house. It wasn’t loud per say, however even with ear plugs tucked wayyy deep inside my ears, I could hear it. Or I suppose feel it. It was a vibration. We tried turning off the AC, the fridge nothing worked. I would be fine standing in the room however the minute I laid down it felt like I was shaking. I took sleeping pills, drank tea, drank everything!! yet sleep would not come to me. After a few days my roommate was able to sleep, not as well as before but sleep nonetheless. On the other I had to move into my parents house. It has been over a year that I had moved into my parents house- In the meantime I tried to sleep in an another apartment and wasn’t able to sleep there either- I think the downstairs neighbor had a fan on. I sleep with earplugs on currently in my parents house in the suburbs. Sleeping has almost become a fear now.. or the attempt at sleeping only to stare at the ceiling for 6 hours a day. I experience anxiety and anger when I think about sleeping. I want to cry. I cry. Doesn’t help with sleeping but helps me relax.I am fully aware that it is unrealistic to expect a place to be completely void of sound. I want to learn how to be able to sleep with whatever’s happening. Please dont tell me to imagine mentally erasing my legs or clearing my mind or taking a bath. Sleeping pills do not help me get a good sleep- they put me down but it I never wake up rested. I wake up...paused. I don’t know if the makes sense. Ugh.I promise I am not intentionally trying to stay awake. I love sleeping, I would love to do more of it. If there is a thousand dollar ear plug I will buy it, experimental treatment? I’ll do it. Give me suggestions, personal experiences, success stories. I would like to get better at sleeping. Please help.
Signal	Melatonin hasn’t been working the best for me, I get sleep anxiety and the thought of having to sleep gets me stressed and so I don’t sleep instead. Do I ask my doctor to prescribe Doxylamine even if i’m 15?
Signal	Hey there peeps, this is my first post here in this community.Let me introduce myself a bit, 23 years old male, university students.Ever seen I start college I've been having hard time falling asleep like really hard. I'll be starring at the ceiling for hours, my room is pitch dark and I need an ambient sound to fall asleep (fan noise), without this it's a lot worst.....With this lockdown and I'm unable to do any outdoor excercise (running), my sleep schedule is all mess up. I'll be sleeping like 5-6 in the morning and wake up somewhere 12-2 noon. Even university is out, there's tons of coursework that I need to be done and I'm soo behind scheduled.The problem is that my sleeping schedule are been push back later by day, soon I'll be sleeping around 12 noon. And always woke up feeling restless.Any suggestions or any of you had a this kinda experience?Sorry for my bad English
NotSignal	My matress is extremely sunken in in the middle and I never had insomnia problems up until the mattress started sinking in. Not sure if it’s related or not but either way I want to get the tempurpedic pro adapt. I’m weary on spending 3k on a mattress during this time, I just went back to work after six months of work being closed. I missed the whole summer season which is big money in my industry. I planned on doing this anyway, but now is just such a bad time. I’m even considering buying a new cheap matress for a year or so then seeing what happens? But that seems like a waste if I plan to buy the temper anyway.
NotSignal	I just want to close my eyes and fall asleep,Not fall into a train of thoughts with the need to pee every 20 minutes
Signal	So I've been using ambien, klonopin and some other benzos for sleep. I used to take them from time to time, but now my insomnia became worse and I need to use meds almost every night.I'm looking for meds which can help me sleep but without them being addictive. I also don't want meds that I can develop tolerance for.I've already tried:Melatonin (didn't help much)Trazodone (also didn't help)Phenergan (does help but makes me tired for 16~ hours)Mirtazapine (helped a bit but I don't want to gain weight) Do you know similar meds? Thanks
Signal	I'm completely dependent on medication to sleep. I can't nap or sleep without the medication. I'm mechanically unable to sleep without the meds. I'm currently awaiting a PET scan to confirm Fatal Insomnia. Already had a sleep study that noted abnormal sleep patterns, with reduced and delayed REM sleep.
Signal	Unless the room is freezing cold, I'm on my meds which give me horrible dreams and doesn't actually let me sleep-sleep, or if I've run my body into the ground. It's 4:37, my heart is palpitating, have had horrible sleep the last few nights. I think I'm finally ready. I usually exercise twice a day, once when I wake up, and once before lunch, but do to an injury I haven't been able to and I've been s u f f e r i n g. It's been a week though, so it's probably healed and I'm excited to finally getting back into my routine.
NotSignal	For as long as I can remember I had trouble sleeping falling asleep and staying asleep.When I had a regular schedule with school, I usually went to bed at 0-1 AM. and typically fell asleep around 3-4am and sometimes 5-5:30AM. And I would wake up atleast 3-5 times each night.I had to get up at 6AM to get to school in time. So on a normal school day I would have had between 30 min-3 hours of sleep with a lot of waking up during the night. &#x200B;From what I can read that's not normal and could be Insomnia.&#x200B;But here the flip side, on extended holidays like summer holidays I sleep from around 6-7AM to 4-5PM. So that's around 10-11 hours of sleep,I would still wake up a few times but nowhere near as much as when I went to school.&#x200B;As I am not 'cured' from bad sleep I dont know whats causes this, is this even insomnia as it is inconsistent when holidays arrive, so do anybody know whats going on or causes this? or do anybody share similar experiences?
Signal	I have insomnia and SSS, and i haven't slept in 5 days, any tips that could be helpful ;-; in really struggling, thanks and have a nice day :D
Signal	I’m having trouble fall asleep at night. I’m 17 years old and suffer from anxiety (not sure if this has anything to do with it). I am having trouble finding a thing to think about and staying there. I am constantly bringing myself back to a state of just me closing my eyes and not really thinking of something that would help me sleep. If anybody has any clue what I am talking about and has any ideas/solutions I can try I would very much appreciate it.
Signal	I had gotten a panic attack around 11 pm and took a hydroxzine to calm me down it usually makes me sleep but this time it didn’t. My insomnia is so stubborn. It’s 3:42 am currently can I take trazodone (100mg) I need it I’m just staring at the walls, my eyes are burning and I’m yawning but like i can’t fucking sleep I’m so restless. Please help
NotSignal	I am tired of tossing and turning for 2-3 hours just to wake up fully and look over at my phone to find that a couple of hours went by and I must have slept somewhat.I don’t feel refreshed, my eyes are literally bright red, and I don’t remember going to sleep. This fucking sucks and sleep apnea fucking sucks.End rant.
Signal	I was just recently prescribed 50 mg of trazodone to take at night due to my severe insomnia I’ve been experiencing for the past 2 years. I’ve tried almost everything you could think of to help me sleep before I decided it was time for medication. I also struggle with anxiety that definitely contributes to me not sleeping some nights, so I was prescribed lexapro to take during the day to help with that. Have people had experiences with taking trazodone for insomnia and has it helped/ did you experience any weird side effects?
NotSignal	It’s 4:14 a.m. now here where I’m writing this. Also, random text because the Reddit bots told me that the “Your test here (optional) isn’t actually “optional” and there’s even a character count.
NotSignal	So today I haven't got the opportunity to sleep my anxiety reaches its peak when I lay in bed and close my eyes it's weird yesterday I was lucky to get 5 hours of sleep ( full of dreams ) but today's not the case I miss those days when I was able to sleep without issues but despite this I try to stay positive and calm I wish to overcome this anxiety asap btw I am a 19 yo male.
NotSignal	I’m interested to know describe me the days after 3 did you able to function did you micro sleep. How was your memory ?
NotSignal	This has become the average ritual lately. I struggled with this type of pattern for a long time but lately the food aspect has changed things. I've got a super hard time going to sleep sober, like it just doesn't happen. I usually smoke sum bud and drink a few beers before going to bed. Sometimes I just lay there and try to sleep, I'll smoke more weed and then around 1 or 3 I'll get hungry, chow down and 50/50 on passing out around 5 or 6, then get up to take my roomie to work. Tonight it was a cookie. I made myself stop eating it even though I grabbed 2 and I really want it I don't want to continue this habit. I can see it forming into something unhealthy and ugly. My family is all extremely overweight except for me but a guy did tell me recently that this us the heaviest he's ever seen me. I also got clean so I tried to tell myself it's just because I'm not sucked up anymore but now I am trying to take a step back and really look at my lifestyle because I am seeing differences that I don't like. What would yall suggest I do instead? Keep in mind have roomies so limited activities. Thanks for all y'alls time taken to read and reply.
NotSignal	Hello everyone , currently posting this at 4 a.m because I just can’t sleep , I’ve been trying to sleep for 4 hours now and it’s impossible . I’ve been on confinement for 3 months and it’s been really challenging but was sleeping pretty well , then when work started again anxiety came and now it’s impossible for me to fall asleep at night before hours in bed .. I just don’t know what to do , I used to love sleeping but now I’m just dreading it . Any advice ?
Signal	Out of nowhere (almost a month now maybe) I just can’t sleep at night. I’m consistently having 20+ hour days no matter what I do. I finally reached out to my doctor and she’s given me 2 different medications to try, which have done nothing for me but make me so useless the next day. I’m tired of being up crying because I just want to sleep. I’ve tried melatonin, camomile tea, foot soaks, diffusing essential oils, going for long walks, not looking at my phone after a certain point, you name it. I’m currently on day 3 of THC free CBD oil. I wake up at 7 every day including weekends because of my child. I sent my doctor another message but I feel like she can’t help me. I don’t want medications with crazy size effects that make me a shit mom the next day because I’m too exhausted to do anything, I just want to sleep. Are there any other “natural” things that have worked for others that I missed? Acupuncture? It’s almost 4am now and I the thought of doing a 48 hour day is unbearable.
NotSignal	Alright so this helped me few times when I couldn’t sleep but idk if it still works lol but something with salt makes me sleepy and yo give it a try zzz
Signal	I haven’t been able to sleep correctly in days. I’d say close to a week. I’ll be tired all day, and I’ll try sleeping around 10, but I’ll wake up at like 12. Then I’ll stay up all night because I can’t fall asleep until 5, but even then I’ll still wake up at 9. If anyone has any idea on what I can possibly do, I’d appreciate it.
NotSignal	Gonna be another all nighter since something seems to be stuck in my eye and despite all of my attempts to get it out, nothing is working. Oh and laying down and closing my eyes makes it poke my eye or something which makes it sting which is keeping me up. And I’ve been developing double vision along with blurry vision for about 3 weeks not because of insomnia but for some other unknown fanf**kingtastic reason. And I can’t get any of this checked out because COVID is keeping shit closed. And I can’t go to the ER because my mom is very at risk and I’d rather die than risk getting her sick. And I wanna scream my head off because life really sucks right now. Sleeping and never waking up sounds real great right about now. But I digress.. venting feels real good. hope you all get some rest tonight. TL:DR - life really sucks.
Signal	This isn’t for me, but my friend. She has been suffering from sleepless nights since she was in university. That was about 10 years ago. Some nights, if she’s lucky, she gets about two hours of sleep. Others, maybe just up to a few minutes. Other times she doesn’t get any sleep at all for two days straight. She explains that her mind is so overactive that it doesn’t allow her to rest. She’s tried going to the doctor for help which also included prescribed medications, she’s tried herbal medications, binaural beats, you name it. Nothing has helped. I don’t know where to look, or who to ask that can offer some advice to help her, and then I found this subreddit hoping that somebody out there experiences the same struggles as her. Any help would be appreciated!
NotSignal	I'm currently writing this at 1am and having trouble sleeping, i wonder is it safe to drive without sleeping at all?
NotSignal	But as soon as I'm in bed I physically cant fall asleep? I spent all day today trying not to nap cause I knew it would keep me up at night but now I'm looking at my alarm with only 4 hours left unable to get comfortable.
NotSignal	Here's a strange thing that's begun happening to me intermittently in the last six months or so (I'm 22): just as I'm losing consciousness and falling asleep, my mind starts producing very intense, rapid and often bizarre thoughts, accompanied by slide show-like imagery. Like one short dream after the other. Along with this my body temperature rises to the point of discomfort, I get a headache and my mouth gets unbelievably dry. This whole process takes a while, and starts slowly. At first it just wakes me back up, I then try to sleep again, only this time all the described symptoms come back just a little stronger.I don't fully wake up however, and I still want to sleep. This continues for 4-5 hours until the dread of ending up in the scary sleep-limbo gets too strong, and I get up and start over the process of going to bed, at which point I usually successfully get to sleep. Although these symptoms may suggest a serious underlying problem, I believe I've found out what's causing this.To me it seems like this is caused, simply, by unsorted thoughts. Thoughts that haven't been "dealt with" yet, that show up at night when the barriers to entry into the conscious mind are at their lowest. I don't think the severity or negativity of the thoughts matter that much. As long as I carry enough thoughts that are of some weight, that haven't been given enough attention, they make themselves known in this way.Like I said, this is an entirely new phenomenon to me, and I believe that since finishing school and then not having a good routine for a long while I've unlearned, or forgotten the process of daydreaming, seeing what pops up and storing it away. What makes me believe this even further is that this seems happen more when I don't have a few quiet moments before I try to sleep; if I watch Youtube until I can't hold my eyes open any longer, for example. So, to me it seems that I have a need for conscious (fully awake) thought processing that sometimes doesn't get met.So, if you recognise the description of the scary sleep-limbo, try just having a few quiet moments with your mind every day. Eating, I think, is a good opportunity for this.
Signal	Hi all!I started taking Trazodone very irregularly on nights I sensed I would have insomnia. It worked like a dream-including no side effects.Then the pandemic happened, as did a very stressful life event, and I started taking it nightly and it continued to be amazing for me (I wonder if if also helped stabilize my mood both from sleeping and because it’s an Antidepressant.But now I am starting to wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back asleep and feel even worse than I would normally the next day because then I do feel side effect of grogginess of drug.I take 50 mg. Scared to stop taking it, to take less but wondering people’s’ experience with trazodone good/bad in terms of its effectiveness I have had very bad insomnia for 20 years and fbis is first thing that worked!
NotSignal	most nights before bed i drink or smoke weed or both. it’s kind of become a bad habit and now i need one or both to sleep. I can’t financially support smoking lots of weed just to sleep- and then having to smoke again when I get up and then more throughout the day so i can feel decent. i wish i could just sleep without it. does anyone else have this issue? how should i go about overcoming it?
Signal	Hey guyd im new to this subreddit. Anyway like the title suggests is that I cant fall asleep. Im pretty sure I dont have insomia, cuz I can fall asleep at home. But now that Im in College I cant fall asleep no more and I dont know why. So any tips or meds that can help me fall asleep? I already tried 10-20mg pills of melatonin and it doesnt do anything except make my stomach hurt the next day.
Signal	Now, I’m on ambien 10mg and I managed to get 4 hours of sleep but woke up at 2:40amMy day was sort of painful to get through... My eyes strained and a little bit of a headache not that much thoughI manage to get 6 hours of sleep on average despite last night while interrupted it’s still 6 hoursWhat time should I go to bed like 12? And should I cut ambien tonight? It makes me sleepy but hardly enough to knock me outAgain, I should ask a medical professional but still I’d like to get some advice cuz it’s not like COVID will let me get help either
NotSignal	Unos días de estar en cuarentena y derrepente ya no puedo dormir, no sé que me pasa estoy muy triste por el no poder dormir : ( no entiendo que sera si mi familia esta bien y pues procuramos ayudar a todos los que podemos : (
NotSignal	i recently found out this occurrence is called as 'paradoxical insomnia', where you are 'dreaming' of some unusual scenarios (like, i'm in a big warehouse, and then i turn the AC on) but throughout, you feel as if you are aware you are not asleep.once i wake up, i feel like i haven't rested at all.so what i want to know is, is this sleep? i know it's not the same as one, and the tiredness after waking up proves that it is not.i just want to be comforted that i am infact asleep.this recurring insomnia i'm having has become a phobia for me, thinking "what if i will never gonna be able to sleep again". by having this 'paradoxical insomnia', i could at least can count it as not skipping a sleep for a day.idk, i'm just scared that's all.if this infact not a sleep, then try to sugarcoat your answer as much as possible, alright?
NotSignal	I can’t go to sleep, I’m sure everyone can relate to that. It all started when I was a teen and I would stay up with nothing but the a riot inside my mind. Imagine the whole world is on fire, people are screaming and yelling and it’s the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse—well, that’s my mind at 3am. All my insecurities would keep me up or the failures of personal issues beam on me like a flashlight. It’s so hard to go to sleep, and I’ve tried little tricks, having the room completely quiet, white noise, counting sheep but it doesn’t work. I would sleep for like an hour (2/3 if I’m really lucky). I mostly find myself just indulging myself by binge watching tv shows I’ve been meaning to finish, finishing a book, or writing a story. But now it just makes me feel restless, I really want to at least relax while I close my eyes but it just feels like a hassle. I’ve tried some sleep aides but they don’t work. They either kick in too early or too late or not at all. I’m at the point of desperation…..Anyone have any Advice or tips to help? I’m open to try anything
Signal	I'm so confused and slow today. I didn't sleep at all last night except for an hour nap. I'm half asleep but also really awake at the same time. My hallucinations are pretty bad and I'm at school so I can't do my normal stuff to make it better. I keep feeling numb tingling everywhere and I keep thinking its bugs or water. I'm scared I'm gonna start freaking out and trying to pick my skin off like a few days ago. Also I keep satin weird light and the walls keep moving around like jello. I'm in the middle of a depressive episode so I don't think I'll freak out, but I feel like shit and just wish I could go home and sleep. I'm starting to feel suicidal again. School hasn't even started yet and I'm about to have a breakdown.
NotSignal	I would not say i have insomnia, but i do often have a hard time going to sleep. It takes me between 1-4 hours to fall asleep, 1 hour i the absolute minimum except for rare specific times when i have been awake for very very long or after a night of drinking. For you who have more experience or/and knowledge do you have any game changing tips? Would it be recommended to check it?
Signal	I havent slept since last Tuesday, although I think Ive had a couple dreams where I feel like I was still awake. But does anyone else have chronic eye burning and a soreness feeling on top of their eyelid? I also have permanenf tightness on my forehead. Seems like there is no cure for me. Ive tried a lot of sleep drugs, Ambien is the only thing that helped me but.my doctor doesnt wanna give me more. Im currently on sertraline. Anyone have a good solution?
NotSignal	Its almost 11pm and I haven’t even tried sleeping because I just know it’s not gonna happen. My chest feels so so tight and my back and ribs hurt from all of this tension. It feels like I’m forcing myself to breathe rather than it being a natural thing. Its scaring me so much because each time this happens, I feel like it’s the virus taking over. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I want to cry because it’s so hard to deal with this stress every single day. Anyone else feel the same right now?
Signal	I can't deny anymore that it's impacting my work. I (24F) work at a Japanese company in Europe, management consists mainly of Japanese expats. I studied the language and this is currently (as a recent graduate) my main asset, speaking a total of 4 languages while learning relevant skills on-the-job. Last month my insomnia was especially bad, getting around 2-3h of sleep at good nights, sometimes none at all. I'm still cleaning up some of the mess this month. Not only is it affecting my ability to study on the job, I had to give a presentation in Japanese last week and half of the language just slipped my mind. I had to hold it in my native language. I think my manager knows something is up already, since he has been gently pointing out my mistakes. I'm considering telling him about my insomnia and that I'm contemplating medical help. I recently signed for a permanent position, so unless they go as far as fire me, my job shouldn't be in danger. I'm just unsure if management lowering their expectations or seeing me as less capable from there on out is a merit or a demerit. Anyone have any experience with this?
Signal	Not sure if this is the right forum for my issue, but I’ve been on zoloft for about 2 months now, 150mg, and I think it’s the reason I can hardly sleep anymore. I didn’t sleep a wink last night. I got prescribed trazadone to help, but I don’t take it because it makes me feel like absolute shit in the morning. Any advice would be really appreciated.
Signal	I cant sleep, so I'm tired, I don't eat and because of that I dont have energy to do anything it's an endless vicious cycle. I'm skipping school because I cant think.
Signal	It's Friday already, I would feel my eyes tired and then I lay down trying to sleep but nothing happens. What the hell is wrong with me, it's the second time in my life that I'll go this far with no sleep and I'm terrified . Worst part is that I don't feel tired
NotSignal	Couldn’t sleep until 6am last night and missed my early class, now it’s 1am and feeling the exact same as last night. I was hoping I’d be tired enough to sleep since I was practically falling over at 9pm but noooooope not allowed to do that. Fuck this sucks and I hate it, almost every night for years, is this literally the rest of my life?
NotSignal	Idk what to do. I have work tomorrow, followed by a 3 hour class, followed by another hour class. My heart has been pounding and beating in weird rhythms since initially later down. It even feels like it's skipping beats
Signal	I can't ever sleep. *EVER*! And it's getting annoying I have school, so I get up at 4 a.m. And I leave at 6. Last night I dozed off around 3 a.fucking.m and I'm exhausted. Through the entire winter break, I stayed up days at a time. And passed out when my body couldn't take it anymore. I tried melatonin. I tried alcohol. *Nothing* works.
Signal	You've prepared everything, cooled your room, turned off the lights, took a melatonin, and now your finally tired enough to sleep. You close your eyes as you feel your consciousness slipping with each passing minute. Right as your about to pass into unconsciousness you think to yourself "I'm finally falling asleep"This is the moment where it is impossible to become unconscious, you are now self aware of your mind and how long you've been in bed.It is near impossible for you to fall asleep if you are aware that you are becoming unconscious.I've been struggling with intense insomnia for over a month now and the best remedy I've found is not what doctors will recommend you. Putting on an interesting show and going on my phone distracts me enough to help me forget I'm falling asleep. I'll even keep my lights on to even further lower my expectation of falling asleep. It still takes a while of laying in bed to sleep but now I don't even need a sleep aid to fall asleep anymore.Give it a couple days to see if this works for you. The first day may not work because you will be stressing about not sticking to your sleep routine. If nothing is working for you perhaps this will, you have nothing to loose.
Signal	So I have an ongoing issue with both falling asleep and staying asleep. This will happen like clockwork the night before I start my first day of work each week. I work 3 13-hour shifts weekly. I like my job, although it has its stresses and issues like any other job, but I never find myself dreading going to work and I generally like being there. But for some reason, the night before my first shift I just cannot sleep. I either take hours to fall asleep, despite no screens/no caffeine after 3 PM/exercising regularly and eating healthy, and/or I wake up at 3 AM and cannot fall back asleep. Obviously this effects my performance at work, since I am consistently sleep deprived. I've tried taking Benadryl and meditating or doing breathing exercises, but nothing seems to help. On any other night of the week I tend to sleep like a rock, especially if I worked that day. Anyone else have this problem? Also, I've never been officially diagnosed but I've long suspected I may have some mild anxiety; could that be related?
NotSignal	As known , we should feel comfortable with our Psychiatrist , i can see from their behavior too about how much they care or listen , does anyone have ab experience seeking one during this pandemic and was happy or not with the experience? I worry that person would not really even listen t me and just prescribe me different stuff to have me keep come back,i have seen one in person in the past.
Signal	I can't sleep and when I can't sleep I feel shitty and when I feel shitty I do stupid things and get upset easily and rise to things I normally would handle rationally which makes me feel angry with myself which makes me feel stressed and when I feel stressed I can't sleep and when I can't sleep and when I can't sleep I feel shitty and when I feel shitty I do stupid things and get upset easily and rise to things I normally would handle rationally which makes me feel angry with myself which makes me feel stressed and when I feel stressed I can't sleep and when I can't sleep and when I can't sleep I feel shitty and when I feel shitty I do stupid things and get upset easily and rise to things I normally would handle rationally which makes me feel angry with myself which makes me feel stressed and when I feel stressed I can't sleep and when
NotSignal	woke up at 3:30am just in time to hear two of my roommates go to bed, tried to get back to bed for two hours and have finally just given up. I worked 9hrs yesterday dammit, body why aren't you tired? At least the cats are up and playing to I at least have some entertainment. Needed to vent a little.
NotSignal	It’s been 2 weeks. 2 weeks since my insomnia is at it’s worse. I can’t get an appointment with my GP, can’t have a psychiatrist because i need to get referred... What can I do?? It’s not that I want to take the medication route forever, I want it just to get through this rough bout & even maybe while im doing therapy. I really can’t stand these sleepless nights anymore. I thought It was gonna get better, but obviously it isn’t. Any recommandations? I’m from Canada if it helps.
Signal	My doctor has just prescribed me Trazodone 100mg as an alternative to Z-Drugs because they’re addictive and that’s not something I want. Anyone have any experiences at this dose or a similar dose?
Signal	Does anyone here struggle to fall asleep from anxiety? Some days I won't drift off until 11am and I could have been in bed for 12 hours hoping to fall asleep. I've had problems with sleep since I was a kid but they get worse during stressful periods. Does anyone have any tips to calm a racing mind enough to sleep?
NotSignal	Hi y’all longtime lurker here so I’ve been awake for 24hrs currently (11:30 est) and was wondering should I try and sleep now in the middle of the day or should I push to stay awake for a while longer to try and sleep through the night? I know I will be able to stay awake but I just wanted to get a different perspective. I’ve had sleeping issues my whole life but I never know what to do. Thanks!
NotSignal	Ive not had many trouble sleeping however the past few nights have been pretty frustrating. For the past 5 years ill watch tv to help me get sleepy then turn it off to sleep so its never been an issue for meHowever when I turn the tv off and go to sleep even though im tired, my mind isn’t anxious or racing and I feel very calm and comfortable, even after an hour I haven’t actually drifted off to sleep.. has anyone else experienced similar?
Signal	I'm an extrovert, I can't do this anymore. I can't go to work as a bartender and see people all day anymore. I can't just run errands and go to the store or the movies or restaurants. I can't take this time off and travel. This is not living. And now my insomnia is back, probably due to the crazy amount of drinking I did this weekend on order to pass the time and hopefully feel better. I feel like I just entered another layer of hell where now instead of just all day I do nothing I now get to look forward to all night where I can't even sleep. I'm genuinely concerned for my mental health after this. I've tried working out, they closed the weed stores a month ago and I'm OUT. I just can't do this shit anymore. Im not about to march on my states capitol because I'm not an idiot, but I can't keep watching TV, I can't just be on my phone, I think I'm losing my mind.
Signal	Chronic insomniac here. The past couple of days have been rough, and unfortunately I have to drive one hour to get to work. While driving, I sometimes struggle to keep my eyes open (which I know is terrible, but I just can’t keep calling in sick whenever I don’t have enough sleep or else I’d have no job...I really wish public transit was an option for me). I’ve been wondering what it is about driving that’s making me doze off so I could maybe replicate that at home when I’m trying to fall back asleep. So, obviously, driving on long roads with little traffic is probably making me zone out. In my case though, I have to blast warm air from the AC so my car doesn’t overheat and I’m wondering if maybe it’s the warm air that’s making me sleepy. Has anybody felt sleepier through heat?
Signal	It's 1:30 am and I've been tossing and turning for more than an hour. I'm now at my parents place, but I don't know why I can't fall asleep. It's very irritating.
Signal	Writing this at 4 am of course, I’ve seen many people mention here or offline that they tend to wake up after 3-4 hours of sleep and have trouble going back to sleep.But my problem is that almost EVRY DAMN NIGHT, I feel so exhausted at around midnight or 1 am, so what happens is that I would fall asleep on the couch or lying in bed reading or in the middle of watching a youtube video, and it would feel like the best thing ever, only to wake up FIVE minutes later. Since i’m such a light sleeper, usually I’d be woken up by my husband making whatever sound any human being would make when they for example- breath.And then he would fall asleep like a baby while I just sit there in bed, having had just a few minutes of what felt like could’ve been an amazing sleep, eyes wide open, feeling like i want to cry just cause i’m so tired of this, and I’d stay this way until around 6 or 7 am..Please tell me I’m not alone.
Signal	I've been having sleeping problems on and off for years now, but this is the longest it's ever lasted. It first started when I had an anxiety attack while on a trip 2 years ago and ever since then I just can't sleep. Before that incident, I wasn't on any medication and I was doing pretty well with someone who has a history of anxiety issues. But now, it's such a hassle for me to even attempt to sleep. Naps I can sometimes get away with for an hour at most, but anything over is impossible for me. I've been taking prescribed medication that helps me sleep but after I had to ask for a higher dose I've been paranoid that I'll get too used to it and I'll never be able to sleep on my own again. I've also noticed that it's still taking me awhile to fall asleep even with meds. I know people say that darkness helps with sleep but I'm terrified of the dark, I sleep with a tv on and I have a habit of listening to podcasts and asmr while sleeping because I have tinnitus issues too.I'm only in my early 20's and I don't want to be like this forever, I just feel stuck.
Signal	My insomnia is really compromising my life. I have no idea what is causing it or how to stop/change it. I was always a good sleeper but now I’m a total mess who feels like they’re dragging a boat anchor around with them all day. Crazy thing is that I actually feel ok on 4-5 hours sleep but if on the oft chance I get 8, I can completely feel the difference. Now, I have no problem falling asleep when it’s time to go to bed (I can fall asleep within 15-20 minutes when I’m tired and want to go to sleep). However, I wake up within 3-4 hours like clockwork no matter what I do and I can’t go back to sleep. I can physically feel my body waking up and even wanting to get up. I’ve tried sleepy tea, weighted blankets, no eating after a certain time/eating whatever, wine, supplements, CBD, meditation, new pillows/sheets and the list goes on with absolutely no substantial change. I’ve been to a sleep study (a total joke), spoke to my dr but nothing is working. I don’t smoke, I’m very fit and eat the best food I can. This is driving me nuts! As anyone been able to stop this cycle for good and get a good 8 hours of sleep regularly. I honestly will do anything. Thanks for the help!
Signal	I knew I had bad sleeping patterns occasionally and would take hours to fall asleep. That's all. I thought insomnia was more intense, at least movies and TV shows portray it like that. So I was given sleeping pills to take before bed and oh man, it was crazy and amazing! I would take them, feel nothing, browse on Reddit for a bit and suddenly just feel so sleepy. Would fall asleep after a few minutes. As long as I take them around 10pm, I should fall asleep at around 12am. I have bad anxiety and depression which probably caused the insomnia. I also consume a lot of caffeine which I know is horrible. I really don't want to rely on meds for the rest of my life (at least for sleeping), so I've been trying to make steps to lower my caffeine intake, try wind down earlier for bed, etc. Meanwhile my bf drinks 3 or 4 cups of coffee a day and sleeps like a baby instantly.
Signal	I've skipped two nights, and found my max is 4 hours sleep at a time. Today I started feeling very lightheaded as well as like there's a brick in my head. It feels liks little shocks going through my body and my muscles and skin hurt, especially if touched no matter how gently. Peoples faces also blur and the images 'glitch', like they looking at me then suddenly their head's turned without the turning motion. I don't have epilepsy or anything. Any idea what this could be?
Signal	I have tired Benadryl, ZQuil, melatonin, a CBD mint, and finally Trazedone. Trazedone actually helped some, but I’ve run out and don’t want to get more as I don’t want to become dependent on it. I don’t look at screens much before bed, I have tea, I stretch, read and listen to a meditation. I have been able to fall asleep taking melatonin alright lately, but I wake up around 5 every night, and other times too, and have trouble falling back asleep, making me feel like I barely slept at all. It feels like I am awake much of the night. Any suggestions?
NotSignal	Hello! My first time posting here. Since the start of the Coronavirus I haven’t been able to sleep well. I either get no sleep at all, or sleep all day and it sucks. Trying to find out what may fix this outside of meditation/drugs.Usually I watch YouTube videos with the god awful bineral beats, which sometimes help. Other times I try to meditate and write before bed. Any suggestions welcome.
NotSignal	I am a teenager, sitting very hard exams soon. I can't get more than 7 hours sleep a night, but most of the time it's about 5. It started when I was a few years younger, I was experiencing severe depression, and as a coping mechanism/ self destruction, I would stay awake for days on end. These sleep habits haven't gone away, and it's definitely beginning to affect my grades. Not sleeping is just normal to me, while everyone around me is worried for me. I have tried talking to my mum about this, but she passes it off as me being on my phone all night. I mean, she isn't wrong but that isn't the reason I can't sleep. Anyway, it's 4am and I can't think straight so I'm ending it here:) just needed to vent I guess
Signal	My sleep disorder destroyed my future. I’m a highschool dropout. I read a lot of posts and I cannot classify myself anywhere.. People complain about staying awake for days, or sleeping very less, but it’s different for me. I cannot stay awake for more than 24 hours. Even with caffeine. But I sleep for 12-21 hours. I stay awake for 18-24 hours. So it’s a both sleep-awake cycle issue. Doctors don’t seem to take me seriously after telling me I naturally stay awake and also sleep for an almost full day. I last had a sleep schedule 2 years ago. Before I gave up highscool. It became impossible to sleep at normal times. My sleep-wake cycle started to grow at a low rate and escalaed to what is it now in 2 years. At least it didn’t get any much worse, I’m the same for 2 years. But I do not live a normal life. I both slept and woken up at every hour in the clock. My issue is that once I get sleepy, nothing keeps me up anymore. I tried drinking 15 energy drinks in 2 hours to keep me awake the whole day so I can sleep the other evening once and I just fell asleep. Caffeine has zero effect on me, it never had, no other than that massive amounts like that almost give me panic attacks. It’s also impossible for me to get woken up and stay awake. I wake up easy. Actually very easy, as a normal person would. I can set an alarm every minute at the lowest volume and I’ll wake up each time. But I cannot stay awake. It got even to the point of getting splashed repeatedly with freezing cold water in the face, dragged out of bed (by my parents and I told them to do this). Those were the times I was still trying to attend highschool. Even after a 16 hour sleep if I don’t do my full natural hours of sleep I CANNOT stay awake, my eyes close by themselves. You can wake me up after 2 or 20 hours of sleep and I’ll feel the same unless I woken up.I fell asleep while standing. I fall asleep in seconds doing anything possible to stay awake (when trying to force myself to wake up). My eyes close by themselves and I get into deep sleep in seconds. I get so angry when people especially my family just don’t understand how bad is it and they say I just became a very lazy person or I am depressed. And they just tell me to sleep early/stay awake the whole day and sleep the other evening and done I fixed my schedule. I want to punch people in the face who don’t understand how bad is it. I went to doctors and they don’t take me seriously, so everything I’ve ever tried is random natural medicines prescribed and Stilnox 10mg (Zolpidem). I got a Stilnox prescription once and less thăn 40mg did nothing to me other than getting me a little high. More than that ended up in me sleepwalking almost each time. Also it had no use to me because remember, I sleep for double- almost triple the normal amount. I pretty much lost hope anything can be done to fix me. I just wonder what is it. How can you fix someone who stays awake a lot and also sleeps a lot? Did anyone ever went through something similar? I’m sorry for my bad english btw, I am not a native speaker. I hope I made myself understood.
Signal	I usually try to sleep at 2am but only end up falling asleep until 6 or 7am. When I wake up around 1 or 2 in the afternoon I'm still extremely tired. I don't feel rested and I have difficulty keeping my eyes open all day, but even if I try to take a nap, my body and brain just don't want to fall asleep.I've bought melatonin with cbd oil the other day, and while it helps me calm down, it also makes my head spin so I don't think I should take it any longer.When I went to the doctor about my sleeping issues, they just dismissed it as jetlag as I went to America a few weeks before that (which is a 6 hour difference from here)Now I'm planning on going to the doctor again with this issue, including some other issues.What are things I should say at the doctors office.
NotSignal	I've been having trouble sleeping for the last few weeks and everything is just goimg downhill, I've tried every medication I can buy without needing to get a prescription (covid and all doesn't make me feel confortable going to clinics and whatever) and I've tried everything, meditation, hypnosis, every medicine, teas and whatever, and it feels so hopeless, I feel tired, I feel sleepy but whenever I close my eyes it just never gets there. My brain keeps fabricating thoughts that are out of my control, it's not "voices in my head" but I'll keep hearing random words that I heard throughout the day kind of echoing without any clear pattern, like if I watch a cooking show, at night my mind will be like "cut onions, water, garlic, taste the dish, meat, sauce, chef, sink..." You get the ideia, or the other day that I watched a "Flavor of Love" compilation, I kept hearing New York arguing with nobody, and it doesn't make any sense. In a way it's like dreaming, in the sense that I feel like it's kind of subconscious, but ironically it's the one thing that keeps me from sleeping. In the last 72 hours I slept about 9-10 hours, 3 hours here, 1 hour there... And it's really frustrating, I hate spending every night rolling around in my bed and crying because I just can't rest, I can't forget about anything that I worry, not sleeping has made my college life go to shit, I can't focus on online classes, I can't do the assignments because my mind does not work anymore at this point. There are moments of the day where I just sit on the floor and look at the ceiling for 2 hours, just completely unable to do anything due to extreme mental fatigue, and then at night, while still tired, I just can't sleep, it's becoming a real hell, I don't know why this started happening out of nowhere. I just wish I could get a heavy medicine from a doctor, or just something that would actually knock me out, my best friend keeps telling me to drink "mulungu" tea, and I bought it today and while it did knock me out, it only lasted 3 hours so yeah, not that great, and I took ot again after waking up and it just did nothing. Idk what I'm writing anymore, sorry for the incohesive rambling, I just wanted to rant about this to someone who wouldn't tell me to drink fucking tea, and alternate between the teas, as if I haven't taken all the teas already. Idk what's the point of this, but yeah, not sleeping sucks.
Signal	Ok I have insomnia, feel tired, want to sleep but cant. Its annoying. So I would like to know what you do when you have this problem.I don't want to have here the basic copy past: meditate/no alcohol/no smoking/ healthy food/no phone/stay in bed just for sleeping...I try it and didn't work. I want to know what do you do at night when you want to sleep but can't. And when you start other thing you are too tired to do it. I try walking outside, watching series, reading on my living room but its just anonying because I'm tired when I'm doing this and doesnt look like to help.So far, release the tense "by myself" is the only small help I found (working like 5% and at least feeling good instead of annoyingly tired). Women always complain about men falling asleep when they are done isnt it ^^?Looking forward yours tips and activities. Peace.
Signal	I try to sleep from 3am to 12 pm. Sometimes I "fall asleep" rather fast (although it doesn't feel like falling asleep, more like stopping being aware of my surroundings and dreaming). Most of the time I can sleep uninterrupted until around 7-8 am.However, it seems like my sleep quality is better in the morning. My sleep in the morning is more, well, sleep. I do wake up 3-4 times after the sun rises, but I go back to sleep almost instantly and it feels like falling asleep. I think I sleep more deeply in the morning..
Signal	I've tried various sleep remedies (including zolpidem) but I generally end up waking around 4am after 4-5 hours of sleep. I usually remain in bed trying to go back to sleep, to no avail, for several hours. I feel like at least my body is resting so that's good right? My question is whether I'm better off just getting out of bed and starting my day? What do others usually do when faced with this?
Signal	Tossing and turning here we go. My boyfriend has his weekend off and works night shift and I'm very sensitive to lights and the computer light is keeping me up. I don't know where the sleeping mask is and even that keeps me up because it feels annoying on my face. Then I start thinking about my heart and that's keeping me up. I just took melatonin but no luck. This is torture
Signal	I had managed to sleep only 4 hours because they are always speaking loud, being dramatic and argumentative can’t speak in a natural normal tone. I barely averaging 4 to 6 hours daily whenever I wakeup I just know I will never fall asleep in that noise, Falling asleep throughout the day feels impossible, I have an appointment tomorrow, My doctor told me that I have high heart rate and suggested it might be because of stress and anxiety however I wanna verify that assessment. I also feel like a zombie throughout the day, It’s impossible to function at work like this I try to minimize caffeine intake. :( please help
NotSignal	Jesus christ I can't win. Allergies still plaguing me so I used the nasal spray ent told me to use. He even said to use it at night. Fucker didn't tell me it can cause insomnia. Up ALL night. Fully alert. Must be what ritalin is like. My brain was on and active, alert. I took a benadryl around midnight but it didn't do shit.Be warned with nasal spray use.
Signal	Hey there. I was recently prescribed Trazodone 50mg for my insomnia and I'm having some weird effects from the drug that I haven't found anywhere else. In general I'm having morning headaches, runny nose/feeling of sneezing, inability to stay up past 10pm, racing heartbeatMy main worry is how I feel disconnected from my body. I can't really articulate it but my hands right now don't feel like my hands. It's almost hard to move/flex my fingers. I'm also experiencing slight muscle twitching and the feeling like I can't control my limbs either. What is happening? Is this a normal effect of the drug?
NotSignal	Hey, I struggle greatly with trying to sleep. I’ve been to the doctors dozens of times in the last five years, but all they do is shrug their shoulders,and don’t seem to take me seriously. and now on my first day of work I have to call in sick because I haven’t gotten any sleep all night. Is there anything I can do to make the doctors see that I need help? I haven’t had a good night of sleep in weeks and I’m quite ready to explode. How do you cope with feeling this way for weeks at a time? Thanks in advance.
NotSignal	Why couldn’t there be a magic button we all press and then we instantly fall asleep? Insomnia is so damn frustrating.I really need to get better at just not caring at all. If I sleep, I sleep. If I don’t, whatever.
NotSignal	Looking for sound/sleep machine recommendations as a last ditch effort to get any degree of better sleep. I usually lean towards white noise. I have already tried (and returned) the Project Nursery Dreamweaver.
Signal	Once university was finally out, and we were on lockdown, I’ve been sleeping fine. Usually going to bed around 1-2am and waking up at like 10 am. About a week ago, I couldn’t sleep all night and was forced to pull an all nighter. It was really weird as I’ve never been awake all night and it’s never happened to me in my life. I thought it would be a one time thing and that I’d go back to normal. However, following that one day, I’ve had trouble sleeping pretty much every day afterwards. My body will only go to sleep around 7AM when I hear the birds chirping. Really strange. Melatonin doesn’t help either. Can somebody please provide some insight on why this might be happening and how to fix it? I feel horrible with so little sleep.
NotSignal	So a while back I started to notice this funky smell coming from my bathroom. It wasn't anything too offensive so I payed it no mind. Well, two days ago it started to get really bad and last night I woke up due to the odor. I wasn't feeling well either so I started to freak out a little. Anyway, I tried going about my day and I called maintenance to put in a work order for it. The guy came buy and he didn't know what it could be so he said he would talk to his manager and see if there were any previous problems with that unit. I never heard back from him... So, I tried to just air out my apartment but the smell continued. It got so bad that I actually had to get a hotel for the night, but when I got in bed and closed my eyes I started seeing images of cartoon like figures. They weren't scary or anything like that but the kept twitching and morphing into different shapes and colors. So, I tried listening to soothing music with rain but it only worked for about a half hour. I'm now wide awake freaking out in my hotel. I was hoping someone could give some advice or if someone has had a similar reaction to a mysterious odor.
NotSignal	Recently I’ve only been able to sleep whenever I spend the night with my gf. There’s always something about sleeping next to someone. However, when I do go back to my apartment the restlessness begins. I usually run on 1hr of sleep and sometimes I catch myself slipping in to a shroom trip type high most of the time at work. Yeaterday I just sat on the counter by my works washroom. I know this streak will end but I dont know when which adds on more unnecessary stress and anxiety. Weed hasn’t been helping and I don’t want to go back to taking medication/sleeping pills. Anws thats my rant :) hope all y’all well. Stay safe :)
NotSignal	My school is in a two week break of not having any work so i dont have school right now (Senior in HS) and ever since then I have started sleeping later and later each going back about thirty minutes last night i feel asleep around 4:00 while i started trying to sleep at 3:30. it is now 5:40 and I feel tired and my eyes are heavy but I have been trying to sleep since 4:00. What should I do?
NotSignal	I lack the ability to sleep and I have pretty bad insomnia if I fall asleep at a reasonable time. Some nights I’m up till 6am trying to sleep while I have to wake up for work at 8. Other nights I get tired and fall asleep at a good time (10/11pm) but end up waking up 2-3 hours later and i’m up the whole night. Recommendations?
Signal	Hi so I know this might be the wrong place to post this but the Ambien subreddit seemed mostly dedicated to memes so I figured I’d give this sub a try. I was just prescribed Ambien for insomnia (5 MG) and was wondering if that is the typical dose to start someone on versus just prescribing the 10 MG pill to start? I’m an 18 year old, 6’3 178 pound male. I was mostly wondering this because I wanted to know if the 5 milligram tablet would still be enough to make me feel tired versus the 10. If anyone has another suggestion for a different subreddit I could try posting this on, I would really appreciate it. Thank you. Also, does anyone here know the differences between this drug and Lunesta/Sonata? Just wondering if anyone has more experience with these drugs than I do.
NotSignal	Hey everyone! Looking for any advice or tips. I am travelling this week and I’m staying at a hotel in the airport. Seen as I’m an awful sleeper and the mix of excitement and “hotel creepiness” might keep me awake, it could spoil the trip. Any tips on how to get 5 hours (what I’m aiming for) thanks. [I am waking up at 5am]My schedule is fu**ed atm.
Signal	It has been 4 days or more since i last slept I am tired but can't doze off if there is any method which can help me to induce sleep please share
Signal	I used to have a gift, where I would fall asleep in seconds. Since about 6 weeks ago (before quarantine) it's been taking me hours to fall asleep, and I keep waking up. I work out for 2 hours every day, eat healthily, and cut out caffeine. I've tried Benedryl, hydroxyzine, Trazadone, sonata, and Ambien. Is there anything else I can try? Medications? Techniques? Please help, I'm starting to go insane.
Signal	I've had problems with insomnia for about 4 years now. It seems to pick up extremely every 4 months or so. I'll get maybe 2-3 hours a night on a good night during this time and it's become such a burden to myself and others that it's literally caused me to quit jobs before because I had no other choice other than to quit or be fired (for calling in so many times)...I struggle with depression and anxiety and have since at least High School - that was when I really realized I needed help to overcome my feelings. My mom took me to a doctor in our rural little town and I was told I was being over emotional and the doctor simply suspected I was someone looking for recreational drugs. She gave me this off brand medication and told me to take it "whenever I felt anxious". I tried it and felt no difference whatsoever, so I quit taking it and never got a refill. Since then I've been embarrassed to go to a doctor because I dont know what to say to make them believe that I truly just want to be able to sleep and not have panic attacks anymore.Fast forward to now, both my parents have passed away, I'm 26 and am dealing with severe insomnia once again. I've tried earplugs, changing my diet, yoga/meditation, melatonin, and even tried products containing "Diphenhydramine" which I recently found out has been linked to alzheimers and dementia. These pills helped me fall asleep but I would still wake up 2 hours or so later. I really dont want to keep taking them though because the side effects arent worth it.My main problem is that everyone seems to find help only through visiting a doctor, psychiatrist, or getting perscription medication. I work 2 jobs right now, around 40-45 hours a week (let's call them Job A and Job B). Job A has health insurance benefits, but the general coverage is too expensive for me to afford. I only have dental and eye insurance. If I paid for regular insurance as well it would pretty much take all of that paycheck. Job B is where most of my income comes from, but they do not offer any type of insurance benefits whatsoever. I really need help but I'm living paycheck to paycheck and rarely have enough money for groceries. My parents' deaths really took a toll on me, not only mentally but unfortunately financially. They were bankrupt and I'm still having to pay for their debts 3 years after their deaths.TLDR; What are my options for getting help when I have no health insurance and no extra income...? Any help is appreciated.Thank you, sorry if the formatting is bad, I'm on mobile and am also new to posting on reddit. :)
Signal	Can’t sleep and have to wake up at 4:30 am every workday, no matter how tired I am I just can’t sleep. They gave me hydroxyzine to relax but it only made me sleep one day, I just want sleep. All my anxiety is just sleep nothing I else. I wish I had at least 2 or 3 hours of sleep.
NotSignal	I have no problem falling asleep tbh - rather STAY asleep. If I wake up at 3:00 I know it's doomed and time to start my day.Anyone else? What can I do?
Signal	I’ve had insomnia since I was a teenager, I genuinely cannot remember the last time I got a full, restful 8 hours of sleep at a normal time (eg not 4am-4pm). I’ve spoken to my doctor about this. I tried trazodone, but it gave me migraines. I’ve also tried ambien (fast acting and slow release) and it doesn’t seem to work at all, unless I take more than one — which is a 50/50 chance of either falling asleep or hallucinating. Are there other sleep medicines besides these two?? I see a new doctor next week and I’m really hoping she can help.
Signal	Hi everyone,I’ve been on Seroquel 50mg at night for about a week... I take it solely for insomnia and don’t want to stay on it for long, so was planning on switching to high dose L-Tryptophan for sleep. If I took Seroquel last night am I okay to take L-tryptophan tonight, or is their too big of a risk of serotonin syndrome? Appreciate any input!
NotSignal	When I dont drink water I'm thirsty as hell, when I drink I feel like my bladder is about to explode. HELP!
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for the last couple years. It’s started getting really bad in the past year, I quite literally can not fall asleep until I physically can’t keep my eyes open so I pass out. Because of that I usually don’t remember my last hour or so of when I was actually awake. I will lay there for hours upon hours with my eyes closed and no electronics or lights on. I’ve tried melatonin which didn’t even help in higher doses (I know you can’t overdose on melatonin and taking more than needed won’t actually help blah blah blah but when I say higher doses I just mean the higher doses that can actually help) I’ve tried ambien or however it’s spelled and that didn’t even help it just made me a tiny bit sleepy but I still couldn’t go to sleep at all, I’ve tried trazodone and that seems to help the most but i still usually can’t fall asleep. I’ve tried changing my eating routine and habits to help me fall asleep, I’ve tried working out or going on runs and stuff during the day, but nothing seems to help. I’m awake until AT LEAST 8:30-9am every night. Then I sleep until about 12. Before you say it I’ve tried getting on a sleeping schedule but I can’t when I physically can’t fall asleep. If I stay up all night and try and stay up all day so I can go to sleep at a decent time I’ll end up crashing anywhere between 1 and like 4-5 and then I will be wide awake until about 11. I can’t drink energy drinks to help me stay up throughout the day because those just make me drowsy.
NotSignal	I live in a very noisy environment and can only sleep with earplugs. But after 2 years of using them every night I am starting to notice some hearing loss so I figured I'd stop using them. Any tips on how to ignore ambient sounds when falling asleep?
NotSignal	I know wearable technology isn’t the best way to track sleep, but I need suggestions on the best sleep trackers. If I am lucky, I do get roughly 2 hours of sleep at night and I want to start tracking everything. Preferably something that won’t cost me an arm and a leg! (:
Signal	This has never happened to me before. I have a pretty forgiving schedule, with mostly afternoon shifts at work and a long weekend, so I can pretty much go to bed and get up whenever I want. Like many people here, I'm a person who's never been able to fall asleep quickly, and in a nutshell I think it's because I've never really learned "how to sleep" so much as I have been able to "ignore it" and eventually go to sleep anyway. And that's worked up until now, but for whatever reason, starting with this week it's as if a switch has been flipped in my mind, and my own concern about my lack of ease with falling asleep seems to be rendering me incapable of sleeping hardly at all.I've tried a few things, like keeping my room dark and cold, specifically avoiding sugar or caffeine before bed, avoiding screens, and lying down at an earlier time, but none of it seems to have had any effect as of yet. I've been prescribed hydroxyzine and used OTC sleep aids to supplement, but they don't seem to do the trick either. It's because of this and other factors that I'm beginning to think my condition is more behavioral? I've noticed that as I tried to sleep the past few nights, my heart and mind have raced on and off, and I can't relax as I normally would. I figure it's either that I've somehow become deficient in melatonin, or I'm undergoing some sort of worry-fueled episode that's making the act of sleeping itself stressful. It's as if, while before I was simply able to not care about needing more time to fall asleep, right now my concern about it is becoming so great that it's going into overdrive - whenever I try to sleep I feel the immediate need to do something to fix it, but of course that only serves to keep me from relaxing.What should I do? Is there really a "way" to sleep that I just need to learn? Should I see a professional about it? I just don't understand how this can happen to me so suddenly after years of having no problems, and being in one of the most lax points in my life.
Signal	I have gotten prescribed everything and nothing works outside of 6mg lunesta an 20mg ambien ir... have a high benzo tolerance so. But 20mg helps me sleep great, it’s the only thing in this whole fucking planet it seems like
NotSignal	Hows your day going fellow Americans? And how's your night going fellow Europeans? Another day another 4AM post from your friendly European grad school student, I seriously just feel like killing myself now that's how bad this is I need to be focused during the day and this shit is destroying my life.I managed to get 4.5 hours of sleep last night. And I thought being tired all day, going to the beach and swimming, then exercising for half an hour doing pushups and etc I could finally be able to sleep today but no it took me half an hour to fall asleep and then I woke up 3 hours later at 3 AM and now it's 4:20 blaze it and I can't go back to sleep at all. Like at all.
NotSignal	I hate this. Everytime i have the slightest thing to do the next day, i cannot sleep. What is wrong with me. I’v been having insomnia for almost 8 years now and i don’t know what to do. Any advice on what to do today?
NotSignal	I feel like, when I manage to get some good sleep in, it gets worse. I am not a diagnosed insomniac, but I have symptoms of mild insomnia, go to sleep at 2-3am and wake up at 6:30, so 3-4hrs, up to six if I'm lucky. But during weekends I tend to sleep longer, for example I have my job on a Saturday and wake up at 8 or 9, this gives me 6-7hrs maybe 8 if I'm lucky. And on Sunday it's free range, but during the quarantine I have been getting more sleep, waking up at around 7:30 or 8 every day, for online lessons. It's been giving me more sleep, but I also noticed that I go to sleep later. In the beginning, before online lessons I slept for long, got A LOT in, I'm talking 8-10hrs, RECOMMENDED AMOUNT!!! Then the problems came, I started going to sleep later, leaning towards 3am or over, waking up for periods of time at night and being in a constant falling asleep state. Then when I regulated it helped a little but now it's just the same, and whenever I get some good sleep in, I just fall asleep later, causing me to loose it the next day. Idk, I still am getting more hours in then usual but I just hope that the problems won't carry on after the quarantine. If they do, then I'll be just as screwed as you hard Insomniacs! But I thankfully still manage to get hrs in every day, as for people who don't: you have my deepest empathy and respect, I make use of a load of sleeping tips, although I do have a couple of bad habits, try to negate yours and use the tips.
NotSignal	Before quarantine, I would get these insomniac episodes where I couldn't sleep till like 3. But now, it's been happening much more. Note these episodes have gotten worse where I can't sleep till 6/7 am. Please give me some advice on how to fix this.
Signal	My insomnia started when I got my first job. Its persisted for years since then, flaring up every few months or so. For a long time I didn't want to admit the reason, but there's no other explanation.I'm not afraid of being late or anything like that. I have no idea why this happens. I dont hate my job, it's not stressful. So why do I wake up 2 hours after finally falling asleep to my heart thundering?The worst part is when you get so angry and just give up. I'm sitting outside watching the sun come up, counting the minutes until my alarm goes off and I have to get ready. I dont want to drive to work. I dont want to go. I want to go to sleep. Why can I only get one good night's sleep a week, on my night off?
Signal	Well this is the worst it's been in a long while. I never have trouble falling asleep when I've taken zolpidiem but today I'm hyper. Brain won't stop. No negative thoughts, just thinking and planning household chores and stuff. Even finally ordered a steam mop online in the middle of the night.Actually contemplating going *eff it* and not sleeping at all. But, I don't want to be zombie tomorrow now that I'm more or less a single dad of two. Then again I'm not sure I can avoid that at all.Crap. This sucks. Also I've not really anyone to talk to about it either (well except my doctor now and then I guess) which is frustrating. I wish sleep wasn't so damn important.
NotSignal	4th night in a row with broken sleep. I’ll go to bed early and still wake up at like 3 or something. I’m not sure what it is.
NotSignal	Hey, any attractive female insomniacs want to meet up around Sydney? I can send you a few normal pictures, and verify who I am through PM, I think you will find me very attractive (Who knows I could be wrong you can decide haha)I’m not looking to date, just a friend and companionship for now. I know it’s really vain, but for me it’s analogous to seeing a soft pretty aesthetic artwork, that I get to hang out with and relate to. (Must be suffering from insomnia! Or have a strong understanding of its implications please)If you have anxiety that’s okay, we can PM for a while and see if we can get comfortable:). I have social anxiety myself, but I think it would be easy to relate and connect with each other’s experiences.Hope you PM me :) I am 25 btw
Signal	I could not sleep last night and it is now almost 5 am and I have to be up at 6. Is there anything worse than the purgatory that is your bed on a sleepless night??
NotSignal	For the past 3 months my sleep has randomly changed. I used to get 7-⁸ hours solid continuous sleep.Now I wake up every 2- 3 ish hours and pretty quickly fall back asleep. So usually 2- 3 ish hours , at the same time during my 8 hour sleep Don't know why. I know I have mild sleep apnea and been using CPAP for a month. But regardless with the machine or without it's same thing of waking up every 2-3ish hours, easily falling back to sleep.I really have no-little stress in life.Is this considered insomnia ? Is this bad for my health ?
NotSignal	Does anyone feel like their face changed due to the lack of sleep? I feel like I’ve gotten uglier because of my insomnia and I’m not talking about dark circles and stuff like that.
NotSignal	I haven't been sleeping well for the past 8 months on account of lots of things but this week has been particularly taxing. I've been really sick and can't get a full night's rest and it's making me more sick. I showered, practiced some yin yoga, mediated, and laid in bed last night at 9pmish but woke up every thirty minutes until 6am. When I did achieve to slip into sleep I had disturbing dreams that only made me wake up again. I'm going to a class in an hour that requires physical strength and mental presence and I hope I can hang. Anyway just wanted to bitch. Dueces.
Signal	It’s 2 am and I have to get up a 4 am. I’m pissed at myself because I don’t even feel tired yet. I know I can fix this if I get a good sleep schedule but for some fucking reason, I choose to continually live constantly tired.
Signal	I'm pretty sure my supervisor has it as well, seeing as I'll come in at 5 am to an email sent at 2 in the morning. Beside the point. I've struggled with this my entire life. It really got bad around 15. (Close to 30 now.) Where I'd go without sleep for days on end and fall asleep inappropriate places. It's been bad recently again. Sleeping a few hours a night, being at work for 11-12 hours, and falling asleep at traffic lights momentarily. I feel myself drifting off often when I drive. I guess driving is relaxing for me or something, I don't know. How do I explain I may be late tomorrow because I'm still not asleep and I don't know when I will be? The anxiety of sending the text is making things worse.
Signal	History: Terrible broken sleep the past couple of months where I have only been able to stay asleep for a couple hours then I would be awake. Total sleep 5 hours or less each night. Sleeping meds most of my life I recently started trying to fall asleep at midnight the last week. I figured if my body only needs 7.5 hours of sleep then I would wake up by 7:15. I took melatonin and 5 htp at 10 every night. I used uvex blue light blocking glasses at 10 until I was ready for bed.The first few nights I at least fell asleep on time. I would wake up a couple times throughout the night. Even if I woke up early or started my day early I still aimed to get in bed and try to sleep at midnight. Fast forward to last night and I was falling asleep while watching TV with my wife. I went to bed a bit earlier 11:30, but honestly I could cry because I never knew what it meant to be tired without sleep medication. I woke up early today obviously, but I also slept for 5 straight hours. I plan to keep doing the same things I did yesterday (3 or 4 long walks outside), and I have faith that sleep will eventually come again.My thoughts:1) Definitely follow sleep hygiene, don't stay in bed if you can't fall asleep or wake up2) Invest in some blue light blockers i dont just mean the 15% to 20% blockers but the amber colored ones kudos if you can get them in rx3) Exercise a lot each day as much as you can4) Try to at least consistently go to bed same time each day and don't go to bed too early, midnight has been working well for me5) Even if you still get the same crap sleep for a few nights give it some time, i have a habit of just jumping ship whenever things don't work and it tends to perpetuate my insomnia due to the changes
Signal	So COVID-19 hit and I got kicked off campus and I had to move back home and finish school here. I’ve struggled a lot with anxiety and PTSD and depression and being here has made it so, so much worse. But, all these issues have never affected my sleep until now. I’m having all these intrusive thought spirals and it’s like my brain won’t shut up. I’ve tried counting backwards, I’ve tried podcasts. Nothing can shut my brain up. I’ve been falling asleep later and later since this all started. Now I’ve been on a schedule of sleeping from about 5 or 6 am to about 2 or 3 pm. But tonight is the first night I haven’t been able to sleep at all. It’s 6 am and I’m supposed to drive for 4 and a half hours soon. I don’t know how I’m going to do it and I’m so frustrated which is making it worse. Should I just say fuck it and just get up and try to stay awake until tonight? Should I try taking melatonin tonight? I really have no idea what to do, I’ve never had this problem before and I’d really like to fix it. I’m sorry if this sounds like insane ramblings I’m just frustrated.
NotSignal	I keep twitching and having constant anxieties when I sleep. It’s hard for me to get off my anxieties. What should I do? This been going on for 2 years.
NotSignal	for several years i've been suffering from poor sleep quality. my sleep drops down in specific parts of the year, around January or February. once it drops, it stays that way 365 a year, until it drops again next year around those same months. just spontaneously. like a biological clock or something. nothing significant or special occurred in those months. it was just something totally out of the blue. my eyelids twitch all the time now and my brain now feels as if i've been starved of sleep. i sleep for 8-9 hours but it feels as if i've only slept for 1 or 2. I had to quit school because i simply cannot think the way i used to anymore.i had a sleep study done in late-2013, the same year my sleep problems started, and they said i had light delta waves and more stage 1/2 sleep cycles than stage 3/4. I also have early-morning awakenings [i wake up a few hours before my scheduled wake-up time] which persists 365 a year for the past 7 years. can someone please help me and give me advice or give me theories on why this is happening to me? i can't afford to see more doctors as my medical insurance is really bad.
Signal	I just wanted to say thank you to this community. When I moved cities a couple of years ago I started experiencing insomnia and I'd occasionally come on here anonymously to read posts. Tried many things over the last two years, meditation, sleep hygiene etc. Even went as far as to try Xanax. Only thing that worked was alcohol but then I would wake up in the middle of the night Family, doctor, no one understood. It was really difficult and isolating. Only thing that kept me going was knowing there were other people out there with the same problem that bravely faced it everyday. Some kind user posted about CBT for Insomnia last month and I ran it by my doctor. She did not have much idea about it but said it could be worth a shot. I've been doing it with a coach for 4 weeks. After 2 years and many many different tries, I finally had a full 6 hours of sleep with no anxiety. This is the most hopeful I've been about my sleep since insomnia first hit me.
Signal	Wednesday I had a sleepless night, Thursday night I slept during 7 hours after taking 15mg of Zopiclone. (because i became too tolerant on the 7,5 mg) Friday night (last night) I had another sleepless night even after taking 15 mg of Zopiclone, i guess I was too anxious. Right now, my eyes are burning and i’m scared of going through another sleepless night. I never went through 2 consecutive or more sleepless nights before and that’s like my worst fear ever. What should I expect the following day? How well will i be able to function? My parents don’t take my insomnia seriously so i’m afraid they won’t drive me to the ER if it’s actually happening. BUT, If I go through another sleepless night and somehow convince them to drive me to the ER, what should I expect. If I am very insistant, is it possible that I get referred to a psychiatrist? So that I can get my insomnia under control? Sorry, i’m asking a lot of questions, but I am really anxious and I don’t think I can get through another sleepless night. Thanks. TLDR ; it’s nowhere near my bedtime yet, i’m just anticipating and i’m scared of what the effects of two consecutive sleepless nights will have on my brain. So, i’m asking what should I expect and If i’ll easily be able to have a psychiatrist if I go to the ER after 2 sleepless nights.
Signal	551 am. wide awake. body aches. took 10mg of melatonin. suspect that might be too much. 7 was working for a few days and managed to get some sleep but i stayed up about an hour over the time i normally go to bed (1:45am) the other night to finish an essay and now my entire schedule is fucked. i cant seem to convince my body that i'm asleep, even if i remain perfectly still. sometimes i wish i could shoot myself just to sleep. desperate for help. dont know how much longer i can go on like this. jerking off doesnt work. nothing works. im a prisoner in my own flesh
NotSignal	I was sleeping 4 hours per day because I wake up really late, but I've been really anxious with a really heavy heart and my kind think there's snakes coming towards me when I close my eyes
NotSignal	Currently withdrawing from nicotine and have reached the insomnia/ restless stage. Any methods for getting to sleep faster?
Signal	I took my hydroxyzine around 12, actually took double my recommended just to try it out. It’s now almost 4am and I’m a bit hyper. Kinda hungry. I have work at 8am. I fucking hate this. Anyways how are you tonight
NotSignal	So it’s been about two weeks since my grandfather has passed and it hit me really hard ( lots of sleepless nights ). Then the next week my car breaks down completely and I have no funds to fix it.Today I was able to trade the car in and purchase a used car and don’t have to ask for rides from friends and family. I think tonight will be the first night in about 2 and a half weeks I’ll get some good sleep :)Bottom line is there is hope and I hope you all stay strong.
Signal	About a month ago I’ve been dealing with some bad insomnia. I recently lost my job due to the pandemic and haven’t had much of a routine (at my job I was on my feet for 8 hours) I had two nights in a row that I didn’t sleep at all in the beginning of the month and now I have developed anxiety about sleep. I’m now suck in this strange pattern of sleeping one night and not sleeping the next night on and off. I sleep just out of pure exhaustion from having anxiety. I’ve tried OTC sleep aids Melatonin/other herbs (they do help bring down my anxiety) Acupuncture Physical activity Meditation Some CBT (although the drama of this sometimes heightens my anxiety) Constant wake up time. I really want to stay away from sleeping pills I’m just worried I may never go back to normal and I hate thinking that there’s no answer to this problem and I really don’t understand what caused this in the first place, I’ve always been a great sleeper. I just don’t know what to do. I’m a 27 year old female, could it be something hormonal? Any help/encouragement/advice is appreciated.
Signal	I live in a huge metro area with many doctors in the US. I have come to accept that my body is pretty weird in how I process things. I have bad side effects to many medications; with other medications, I process things too quickly.I was working with a couple psychiatrists for a few years, but they didn't give me a whole lot of options to choose from to try to see what worked best. I was taking Klonopin for several years but had to take OTC antihistamines with the Klonopin for it to work. One psychiatrist said my other two options beyond Klonopin were Trazadone and Seroquel and that was it. (I'm allergic to both of those.)I'm working with a GP now who has cycled me out through short-term supplies of several other drugs to let me see what works for me. (We're on #4 now. She is ok with prescribing benzos but would prefer I take non-benzos.)At this point, I've had bad reactions to several of the drugs but have been working on my mental health and sleep hygiene at the same time. I was finally able to fall asleeps the night before last on my own but had to take a small dose of Temazapam last night to fall asleep.I'm frustrated because I feel like my GP is frustrated that my body is not responding. However, she's the only doctor I've encountered so far who's willing to experiment a little.Do I have unrealistic expectations hoping doctors will be willing to work with me more? I do understand they have liability issues, but if they prescribe me something that I have an allergic reaction to and can't take, then what am I supposed to do other than just keep trying from the natural side of things? (Which I am doing)
Signal	I can't out of this dumbass sleeping pattern where I sleep at 3-4 am one night, not at all the next night, and then 4-5 pm the next day. No matter what I do, it always reverts back to this fucking loop. I feel like I'm going crazy.
NotSignal	I fell asleep finally and slept for 11h. Only problem is that made me wake up at 3pm which is far from a normal sleeping schedule and might be problematic tonight but oh, well. At least I finally slept.
Signal	48. M. Rheumatoid Arthritis but no flare ups for many years with no regular medications besides the ones I'm about to describe.So for the last few weeks I've had some not great sleep. It started with shortness of breath and a much more intense kind of hypnogogic jerk. I used to have those semi-regularly. All I can say is that those felt more like they were deep body jerks and I was able to go to sleep after one. These I felt very much in my chest and I couldn't sleep for a while after if at all. Sometimes it also came with chest pain. Sometimes with shortness of breath. But when I got it then I couldn't sleep for many many hours. Ended up getting several Covid tests and blood clot tests. All negative.Given that I've been having a lot more post nasal drip and I've gained some weight during quarantine I assumed it was something with allergies and maybe some apnea. I got some fluconase and saline spray and did that 30 minutes before bed. That worked a charm.Until it didn't.Now it's five or six days of bad sleep. Benadryl doesn't help. The only thing that has worked and where I've gotten a full night's sleep in the last week has been Ambien. And with that I've got worry about repeat use with that drug, I'm almost out and I'm also cognizant of the psychological side effects (I had a mild hallucination before I dropped off on it the other night. The waves in a painting on my wall started moving).So normally this is where I go: yeah go to the doctor. Except there isn't general GP service where I am right now. You can just go to the hospital. Where the covid is. And in case someone's like "this might be stress" I agree. It might be. I have to get on a plane in three weeks and go back to the US soon (currently in Ireland) and that certainly seems dangerous in a lot of ways. The air on the flight. The other passengers. Coming back to California when that's a covid hotspot.But if that's the stress - and everyone is going through this - then what's the point of going to the hospital and making things worse and risking more possible exposure.I've got an Apple Watch on and it doesn't seem like my heart rate is spiking more than usual (even though it feels like it at times) and my blood pressure from my home test seems mostly normal. So I guess that means I'm not necessarily having a heart attack anytime soon even if it feels like it to me.So that's where I am. I hope all this makes sense. I'm so tired right now and I can't say that's making a ton of sense on my end typing it. Any advice is welcome at this point.
Signal	Insomnia has affected my life everyday. Each night feels like it’s going to be my last as I feel I can’t go to sleep ever again.
Signal	Im super tired but cant seem to fall asleep. When ever i feel like im about to sleep, i feel a wave of heat and just jump out of bed. How to sleeepppp?!?
NotSignal	Hi folks. I was wondering if you had any advice, media, or techniques that did work for you. Maybe they're not consistent but they have been successful on occasion. I'm finding a lot of tips and videos online but not much feedback on whether they are effective or not.
NotSignal	My life was getting difficult, but it’s gotten nearly unbearable. So, to keep it short I recently got diagnosed with celiac disease and it’s caused me to lose almost 60 pounds and now I’m in really underweight territory. I have no energy, just to walk up the stairs feels like I did an hour of hard labor.I have not slept in over a month, and the most I’ve gotten is 7 hours but interrupted with awakenings. Now, I manage 4-5 hours nightly and I usually have 1-2 sleepless nights weekly. COVID is not letting me get my tests done for my medical stuff, and I’m just completely drained of living. I have constant migraines, irritability, & just severe anxiety.I used to love life, and used to only have mild troubles. Sometimes, I wonder if I should just die or I pray that I die in my sleep.I’ve tried everything for sleep: mindfulness, meditation, sleeping meds, SRT, ACT, you name itI feel tired but my brain won’t shut off! Or when I do drift I wake up every 2-3 hoursI want hope... My life was taken away from meAt least I have my gf, and a little support from familyBut God, I’m drained with life... I have to really motivate myself to want to live everyday
Signal	I noticed whenever I take CBD my dreams become incredibly complex ,like dreaming then waking up but actually you are still dreaming.the dreams seems to be all over the place and very fast pace.
NotSignal	I’m close to 24 hours without sleep, i had a childhood trauma caused by my horrible mother, that made me scared of staying up past 24 hours, it happened to me in the past, the absolute fear that i’m going thru rn, pls i’m here to feel better, please if you can say something relaxing and i can read when i’m gonna have those panic attacks, i would truly appreciate it, thank you.
Signal	Not expecting too much response as reddit seems to be a dying breed for help these days, but, here goes it.I was put on Seroquel 50mg in 2018 as a remedy for my insomnia. At the time, I had already been on Trazodone for a year, and that helped but ongoing tolerance and depression issues worsened as time went on. My psych rediculously put me on Seroquel, off-label for insomnia. Two years goes by, I reach a dose of 300mg, and side effects become a hinder in life. The more I researched it's mechanism of action in the brain, the more I understood these side effects. The worst one is sugar cravings, but recently I have been experiencing heart palpitations, and panic attacks at night after taking my dose. It seems to feel more 'Artificial' now, instead of restful sedation, and I already attempted to quit one time. I used cannabis to help me quit January 2020, and managed to quit for 2.5 months before dreadfully returning to use after quitting marijuana and not sleeping more than 14 hours in about 10 days.&#x200B;My biggest problem is the fact that doctors don't seem to want to prescribe Non-Benzodiazepines such as Lunesta or Ambien, and would rather prescribe an even more dangerous Antipsychotic off label for insomnia. I was doing pretty good while off the Seroquel, I had natural energy back; depression was there sometimes, and anxiety, but it was dealt with because I was sleeping about 5-6 hours a night. Things really got bad, but only when I quit marijuana and was unable to sleep more than 2 hours in a night.&#x200B;This leads me to wanting to just break down what I'm looking for with my psychiatrist. I'm tired of them recommending anti-psychotics for sleep, hell, my psych has shuffled me through so many meds that are useless on top of the seroquel. Mind blowingly enough, the last one she prescribed on top of Seroquel was Thorazine. Thorazina?!?! Are you fucking crazy I thought! Two antipsychotics primarily for a sleep disorder?? I never took the thorazine because I know best now..I desperately just want an actual medication for insomnia rather than these APs, as I fear the ongoing side effects, and I want off again. How can I go about talking to my psychiatrist, I would do anything to get the right meds, and for me and many others the nonbenzodiazepine class would be really useful. Hell, I have primary insomnia, there is no reason I should have received a medication primarily for Schizophrenia before trying the nonbenzos. It's rediculous to me, and I have a drive to push myself to get off this shit, and on to the right medications. I don't want to be playing around with dopamine receptors anymore, I get lazy on it, eat a lot, and primarily lack the drive for life. My question is, should I just straight up ask for a insomnia medication? I'm almost scared to get rejected. But it seems logical to me to do so at this point. I don't want to have to take Seroquel anymore than I have. The side effects are getting scary at this point, and the physical withdrawal I experienced in January this year was worse than alcohol, and was debilitating. I do not know how psychiatrists can get away with prescribing it for off-label uses before giving insomnia patients medications actually meant for insomnia.
Signal	Hello!I have been battling severe insomnia for a couple of months now and recently purchased a CBT program administered via a book. I can’t see any professionals due to the virus and stay at home orders.My average sleep right now is horrific, some nights 1-2 hours and some around 4. I am confused as to what window I should restrict my sleep to, does anyone have any advice on how to get started? Oddly enough even when I sleep 1-2 hours I’m not that tired the next night, although my entire life I was exhausted if I slept less than 5 it is now not the case 😬Is there a minimum sleep window for someone that averages maybe 2-4 hours a night? I’m not even sure how to estimate it as I heard clock watching is very unhelpful. Thank you so much for your time
Signal	I have started dealing with horrible insomnia about 4 months ago. Just one day out of the blue I couldn't sleep anymore. No naps, nothing. My doctor put me on trazodone which worked for several weeks, and then the sleep got less and less. Until I could take trazodone and still be up for days. I was then given Ambien, which never worked. After I finally went to the emergency room for severe anxiety, and insomnia they gave me Ativan. Now I've been taking that with the trazodone for 3 weeks and it just stopped working. I've been told to up my dose of each. I'm at the point where I know it's only a matter of time before the meds stop working again. I don't want to be dependent on sleep meds. Has anyone done cbti for severe anxiety. I tried to read over what it was a bit. I'm concerned because I will be awake for 3-5 days at a stretch, then the other days of the week I sleep about 2 hours at night very restlessly. I can't even take a nap. It's like I hit the first part of sleep, and then just pop back awake. I'm really struggling, and just feel helpless at the moment. I'd like to know if anyone has had success with cbti, and what program they followed?
Signal	I started taking it because I wasn’t able to get to sleep. I began taking 50 mg now I’m at 150 mg. I’m mostly able to fall asleep but I wake up in the early morning around 3 or 4 am. I can’t go back to sleep though. I’m supposed to be taking a sleep test in couple weeks but I’m not sure what happens if you wake up during the test and can’t go back to sleep. Has anybody had a sleep test? Have you ever awakened during one?
Signal	For the last 3 days i haven’t been falling asleep at night at all. Before i would usually get around 4-5 hours of sleep but now i take maybe 1 hours naps at noon then thats it. My head has been hurting like a bitch all morning (its almost 8 pm), i cant take aspirin because I haven’t been able to eat anything for the past month and it will just make me feel worse, my nerves feel shot, i feel exhausted and restless at the same time, I’ve broken down sobbing at the same time every night because this just adds onto the tons and tons of shit i have on my plate right now and my hands started getting shaky about 2 hours ago
Signal	I've been up less than 5h per day this week and even slept an entire day yet I'm feeling more tired than I've ever been and getting awful headaches.This makes no sense...
NotSignal	Hello everyone, so my wife has been having nightmares literally every time she sleeps for the past few months. It doesn’t matter the time of day, what she eats or doesn’t eat. She always has them. Some are reoccurring, others are seemingly random and she says they are so vivid to her. She isn’t a lucid dreamer so she has no way to control it and she’s afraid of and dreads going to sleep now. This happened seemingly out of nowhere and wasn’t caused by any specific thing(s). Has anyone else had similar experiences or can you offer any advice on what we may be able to do? Thank you in advance.
NotSignal	I'm mentally and physically exhausted. I have to wake up at 4am for work tomorrow, for another 12 hour shift (5am-5pm). I have been trying to sleep for 2 almost 3 hours now, I've gotten up, had some water, a bit of food and still can't freaking sleep. Now I'm getting worried I won't wake up when my alarm goes off even though I have 4 different alarms set with different loud tones. Does anyone have any advice that would work relatively quickly?
Signal	I've struggled with insomnia my whole life. Medications only work for so long and i have nothing else I can try. I feel more awake going into the night and I get tired as the sun rises. I've tried all the use your bed for sleep only, have a routine, stay active during the day, coffee only in early morning, wake up sooner.Does anyone no of any, say, unorthodox ways to help with this??
NotSignal	Do you guys have any tips how to keep your serotonin high ? Some suplements, diet changes, vitamin deficiences etc.I tried 5-htp (didnt work), asmr really calms me down though but only when im watching it.
Signal	So I've been doing as much as I can to improve my diet, exercise early in the day, be social, and practice good sleep hygiene.I've posted on here many times before. I have several inflammatory health problems which are made worse by insomnia. I have PTSD from a traumatic childhood and had several bouts of insomnia during my childhood and occasionally in my early 20s. At 26, I went through a very stressful time and started taking benadryl to help me sleep. This stopped working about two years ago and I started taking benzodiazepines routinely and going to therapy. I kept telling doctors that I thought the problem might be hormonal but kept getting shooed off. I'm thinking again that it probably is hormonal and my current GP thinks so too.However, at this point, I've come off benzodiazepines (no significant withdrawals from long-term Klonopin) and still really struggling to sleep and my health is struggling because of this. I went through several GPs until I found one who would work with me but I feel like even she is at the end of her rope.Below is the list of medications I've taken:* Benadryl: no longer works/has a paradoxical effect* Unisom: makes me sleepy and has an anxiolytic effect on me but I feel like I'm sleepy but can't turn off a "switch."* Lunesta. 4 hrs of sleep. Got the metallic taste in my mouth. Only 5 mg would put me out. No sleepwalking side effects. Felt like the sleep was a deep sleep.* Ambien. 2 hrs of sleep. Takes 10 mg to put me out. No side effects/felt slap-happy the next day as if I slept but not a deep sleep.)* Remeron: Made me very groggy. Horrible side effects even at 7.5 mg. Caused super dry skin and the feeling of skin burning + dry eyes and mouth.* Xanax. Worked great of course.* Klonopin. Works fantastic at low doses (0.25 to 0.5 mg) if paired with an antihistamine. I took this long-term with antihistamines and it worked really well for me.* Ativan. Doesn't make me sleepy. Just took it to taper/prevent withdrawal symptoms when first came off benzos.* Temazepam. Horrible reaction. For some reason, I metabolize this really fast and start going into withdrawal between nights. I've never had this reaction to a benzo before.Natural stuff I take:>> l theanine >> GABA>> Magnesium glycinateI have experimented with diet and a whole host of other things. For some reason, the only thing that will really put me out now is an antihistamine matched with something that acts on GABA. I have tried phenibut with antihistamines and this works well but I don't like the feeling that phenibut gives me. I feel "out" of it. Any thoughts? I'm going to call my GP and let her know about the bad reaction to the Remeron and see if she has any suggestions. Please do not give sleep hygiene suggestions.
NotSignal	I wake up every few hours at night and sometimes cannot get back to sleep. I feel much better if I sleep on my side but Im not sure if I have sleep apnea because I don't even snore
NotSignal	Some nights I can sleep 😴 4 hours in a row other nights like last night I was up throughout the night ugh !
Signal	When I first started seeing my psychiatrist a month or so ago, he prescribed 30 mg of buspirone to be taken at bedtime to help me sleep.After a month or so on buspirone, I actually think that it has made things worse. My bedtime is around 10PM, and I frequently wake up around 2 to 4AM and can't get back to sleep. When I do get 8 hours, I don't feel rested and am drowsy all afternoon and evening. I haven't slept until the alarm went off since starting this medication. On buspirone, I never sleep later than 6AM, whereas (on the nights I would sleep), I would sleep until at least 8AM.I also think it has made me more agitated and anxious.Has anyone else had this reaction to busprione? Has it actually made things worse for anyone?
NotSignal	I feel pathetic. My stomach is in knots. I can't be still. I feel so hollow. I keep crying. I stop crying. Then start crying again. Thanks for listening.
NotSignal	I think - I'm finally ready to write this down - that I fixed my insomnia.For the past few weeks, I've been sleeping 7-8 hours a night. Solid, mostly unbroken, restful sleep.I did it by undergoing CBTI. It was one of the hardest fucking things I've ever done, but it genuinely worked. If you're struggling with insomnia, know that there IS a way out - one that does not rely on pills or cheap tricks.No matter what you're going through, it's possible to fix your insomnia. I used Judith Davidson's Sink Into Sleep book to start me off, and Daniel Erichsen on YouTube to keep me going.
NotSignal	Weighted blanket is one of the best sources for naturally sleeping whilst having insomnia (tested it during sleepovers, my friend has it). Add in a little colder temperature to the room, and Melatonin (CBD) or a light supplement for sleep, and the sleep you will get will definitely surpass your expectations. Colder temperature somewhere 17 Celsius is good (although the lower you go the better and faster you fall sleep). So, basically I’ll pinpoint it to you and if you’ll try it you won’t regret.1. Set lower temperature in the bedroom. (if no air conditioning open a window or maybe use a propeller.)2. Sleep in a weighted blanket. (if you add softer mattress and quality sheets it will also aid you)3. Add in a supplement of some sort, or whatever helps you fall asleep. (maybe soothing music, nature sounds, tea etc.)I’have a serious physical issue with rhythmic movement, it’s impossible for me to get enough sleep, and I assure you if you take these steps it will change your experience with sleep to a degree that you will be happy about. Don’t get too excited though, it messes with your sleep :))
NotSignal	Hey there I'm just wondering if I actually have insomnia or its just me having a bad sleeping schedule or something I've tried sleeping early at around 10 to 11 but always end up waking up around 2 or 3 out of nowhere i could never go back to sleep when I wake up I just stay up and around 9 to 10 is when I start to feel tired and at 12 to 1 is when I fall asleep and sleep for the rest of the day,then wake up around 6 to 8 I've tried forcing myself to sleep but I cant get to bed i have a blank mind and dont think about anything i just simply cannot sleep and now I'm actually concerned if this is insomnia or not ik some have it worse though I'm just wondering if this is insomnia or not today I slept at 12 and woke up at 3 I've been awake ever since it's now about to be 7:30 AM and I feel a bit tired I yawned a few times and am starting to feel sleepy pls let me know if this is insomnia or not because I've tried fixing my sleep schedule and nothing works.
Signal	Lately my sleep schedule has been 1-3 hours a night but after a few nights straight of that, I’ll crash out for 6 to 9 hours the following night. This is what happened last night. I got probably 9 hours, I woke up feeling kind of invigorated but then I start to just feel crappy again. In some cases, even worse than I’d feel if I got 2 or 3 hours of sleep. Does anyone else experience this? Not sure if I’m just getting sick or if my sleep debt has reached a point where, even if I get a good amount of sleep, I still feel like a flaming pile of garbage.
NotSignal	I could not sleep last night and I feel super depressed. It’s also raining today so that is not helping. I usually like to go run but can’t go today because of the weather.What is a good activity I can do after work that will fix my mood? What has worked for you guys to leave behind the shitty feeling? I don’t want to nap because I want to save my sleep for tonight. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
NotSignal	I'm not sure what this is called and I dont know how to look it up, but often at night i vividly see "monsters" and I cant rest because of them. I stay up until I'm too tired to go on and then I fall asleep. For instance, theres this giant blue lobster monster laying in the bed. Just laying there. Or some other monster thing is eating my shoulder and I can't shake it off. The thing is though, how I deal with this is in the real tangible world, not in my head. For the last 2 years I've lived with my best friend as a roommate, and we couldnt get a bunkbed so we shared her queen bed to sleep. Because another person was in the bed, there was no room for the giant lobster to be in the bed, so I stopped seeing it. Because I slept against the wall, no monster could eat my arm or leg because my back was covered. All that left was my intense fear of sharks, and I couldnt control seeing a giant shark eating the whole bed, but I could with ASMR because it was distracting. Recently I've moved into my moms new house and have my own bedroom, and some nights it's so horrible. All I have is ASMR now, and sometimes it isnt distracting enough. I'm an artist with a very vivid imagination, so I cant watch stereotypical horror (even pg13) because whatever I see could be there for years and add onto my night horror. (However I can read horror for example because it's me controlling it in my head) I accidentally saw a weeping angel from Doctor Who when I was a young teenager and couldnt sleep for 2 weeks because it was just invading my mental space so much. It doesnt matter if my eyes are closed or open. I also recently got a cat so feeling the cat while I'm asleep also helps a lot but she isnt always there. I'm a Christian and believe heavily in the spiritual realm and influence, so christians and other spiritualists are welcome to give what they may think as well, but I wonder if there is a psychological name for this? Does it count as a night horror even though it only prevents me from sleeping, not happening during my sleep? (I also get sleep paralysis sometimes but my hallucinations are vividly realistic and dont involve monsters, it's stuff like I hear a relative come over and can hear the radio and people I know watching movies and showering and talking in the house, and when I finally am able to move and get up I ask whoever is home if so and so came over of if anyone watched a movie etc. It only happens if I nap in the day time and feels way different than seeing the monsters. Also I can move just fine when seeing the monsters, so I know it isnt paralysis). Thanks in advance to all who read and comment :)
Signal	Recently, i just cannot fall asleep and for all my life i have been sleeping well..sometimes just take a little long to fall asleep. However, this past week i just cannot sleep and feel wide awake. Fuck! Im scared...
Signal	I consistently get 8-10 hours sleep, some nights are a little restless but I never wake up in the middle of the night. However my current sleep schedule is 4am-12pm (it used to be 2am-10pm, but quarantine isn't helping).I've been trying to sleep for the last 2.5 hours cause I want to fix my sleep schedule. I'm fkn tired but cant sleep.Lowkey rant.Thank you
Signal	Hi I am a recent college graduate and I have been recently asked to do job interviews the only problem is that I can’t even wake up early enough to get to an interview. I’m so used to falling asleep however late and trying to sleep 8 hours after. I have no real sleep schedule. I have sleep problems since I was little. Any advice?
NotSignal	Got into bed at 10:00 pm and it is now 4:47 am. No sleep have to be up for work in 2 hours idk what to do.
NotSignal	I'm only in my teens and somebody who diagnoses themselves over the internet. Today I only got 4 hours of sleep and convinced I have SFI, but I still think it's because I was using my phone for like 30-50 minutes before going to sleep.
Signal	Lately my lifelong insomnia has been manifesting as me somehow taking even longer than usual to fall asleep. I usually end up finally passing out either around 5am or in the early afternoon after staying up all night, although last night I fell asleep around 11pm and woke up at 2am, then spent 8 miserable hours trying to go back to sleep before giving up. It’s been worse than ever lately, possibly due to me temporarily moving back into my parents’ house (my old bed is atrocious). I’m just extra concerned because I’m not even sleeping late to compensate, so almost every day for a month I’ve been running on 3 hours or less. I feel numb, foggy and mentally scattered.I’m wondering if any of you have followed similar patterns and especially wondering if you have any tips on how to un-fuck this specific sleep schedule. Like, on days where I’m still awake at 12pm should I just stay up and try to go to bed at a normal hour that night? This is a type and level of insomnia I’ve never experienced; usually it’ll just be a week or so with multiple days of not sleeping at all & some 5-6 hour nights in between.
NotSignal	So it went like this...fell asleep at 11pm woke up at midnight stayed up till 2 took zzzquil fell asleep at 4 woke up at 4:30 to use the bathroom fell back asleep at 6 am. Woke up at 9:30 and slept again till 11:30 am. I need to be able to sleep tonight too what should I do for tonihjt I’m getting so sick of this!
NotSignal	Third night in a row I’ve been awake so far. No daytime naps either. I’ve slept about two hours each the last two nights, so I’ve been awake about 64 of the last 68 hours. What the actual hell?
NotSignal	Somebody eye twitches when they close theirs? It happens to me when i try to sleep. Help what can i do
Signal	quarantine is going great my ambien prescription ran out i have been awake for days. i feel like my body is wilting or something right now i really just want to go to sleep guys. who up click like
Signal	So I’m prescribed Ambien, Klonopin, Trazodone, and Sonata for sleep. Ambien is my goto but because I tend to build tolerance quickly I have to rotate through the other 3 periodically for it to keep working.
Signal	I'm currently in the process of weaning off Remeron. I already weaned off Clonidine. I'm going off them because of the weight gain with Remeron and the risk in pregnancy with Clonidine (I'm trying to get pregnant). I don't know why I thought I could sleep without meds. I can barely sleep with meds, let alone without them. I called my doctor to see if there's something else I can take. My problem is that I'm just not tired at night, but I'm exhausted all morning. I fell asleep at my desk today. It's 1pm and I'm just now becoming more alert. I will be wide awake all night until about 2am and then I will sleep peacefully until 7 when I have to get up. I can't get out of bed in the mornings. I'm literally late every day. I hate this.
NotSignal	I've asked a question pretty similar to this already but I figured I would post again in hopes people with this condition see it. I'm pretty sure I have this, going to get a sleep study done to see for sure. I've heard of a few people that have this issue but apparently it's very rare. I'd love to hear about your experience and if anything helped you/talk about this disorder. Has anything helped you? Medication, therapy, herbs or supplements, etc?
Signal	I am 25 years old, I seem insomnia for more than 3 years, whole nights without sleep. I find it as difficult to fall asleep (hours) as to maintain it (I wake up every few hours) I have tried everything, I do a sleep routine, I have taken many medications and they really do not help me, my doctor told me that they could not do more for me, that my body simply needs less rest, that I have to get used to it. Honestly, I'd rather commit suicide than live like this forever.
NotSignal	Hypnic Jerks have made me lose many hours of meaningful sleep. Every time I go to sleep I keep thinking that hypnic jerks will wake me up when I fall asleep. Surely enough it does and I don’t know what to do. As of right now, I have been in bed for 3 hours and still have not sleep due to hypnic jerk.
NotSignal	Do I stay up and pass out later or sleep for an hour but probably wake up at 6pm?I've been gradually staying up later and later in the morning over the past month. I used to sleep around 2 and it kept going up hourly, recently till 7am but I done did it. Now I gotta fix it or I'll be up till this time tomorrow I normally can pull off a day on no sleep until night time where I pass out at a normal time and wake up earlier. No sleep me is like being hungover and drunk at the same time. It actually works like a cheat code for me. I've done this on purpose in the past as a quick fix to a fucked up sleeping pattern but it's not a habit. I always tell myself I'll only sleep an hour or two and get up but then I just fall into a coma, I do not trust myself.
Signal	I was sleeping just fine for a week now, and I would have probably fell asleep tonight but my mind somehow wandered about Coronavirus and stuff like that... That made me super anxious and I can’t fall asleep. Ugh. I’m super tired, Hopefully i’ll pass out around 7:00 AM..
Signal	3:47am Monday Feb 17th. Work in about 3 hours. I feel so tired I think I could sleep anywhere, pass out at any moment, fall asleep standing up. But here I am? Why? I have never been sleepless but as I age(23) getting to sleep seems to be a larger hurdle coming at me faster than I expected. I cant get comfortable and my mind races through past interactions, feelings, thoughts and my to do list. I've felt a bit down with humanity recently I mean I know there are plenty of wonderful people who outweigh the bad but how can there be so many bad people. Aggressive, inappropriate, inconsiderate, careless, self centered - these are all words that come to mind when I think about things that make me angry with humanity. How can we be so awful to other people and how can we be so selfish to think that our actions dont affect the greater world around us? Fuck. Money problems right? Overworked underpaid bullshit or something similar. We all have these you dont need to endure another ramble about money, but fuck dude. I feel I am changing as a person. Changing into a person that i don't want to be and the worst part is i can see that I'm turning into this person. I cant stop it, is it just adulthood that makes us all tight, narcissistic, stress-filled balls of unhappiness or am I just not dealing with it well? I always have another thing to do, another bill to pay, another problem to fix, another chore to do. Surely this isnt what the next 40 years of my life is going to be? Is it? I had ice cream tonight at around 9:30pm. It was nice, I liked it. Ice cream is short term happiness on a stick. During that ice cream you're just loving life and freely enjoying the deliciousness. Then that last bite comes, you look at the stick and bam guilt. Guilt and a slightly thick queezy feeling in your stomach. I think ice cream can be an analogy for all vices. 4:05 now. Sorry if you actually read this. Just mumble and grumble leaking out of my mouth. If you did read it, try to get some sleep. x
NotSignal	Posting as it may help some who have a busy mind at night as I do. For when you just can't stop thinking.I've never been able to "clear my mind" as people often say to do. I'll have a clear mind for about a second until my thoughts creep back in. I'm hopeless with it.It occurred to me that instead of fighting my busy mind, I'd use it to help me fall asleep.Dreams are often a non-sensical mixture of images and thoughts. Quite different from obsessive thinking at night, which is coherent and focused.The trick is to get your mind into that incoherent and unfocused state. To trick it into dreaming. Not by clearing your mind, but by filling it. I start to free associate all of the first things that come to mind. I keep them random, like picking ideas that don't correlate and picturing them in my mind in extremely rapid succession. In a sense, it's like creating mental white noise. I can't focus on a whatever I'd normally be obsessing over, because my mind is too occupied with thinking of random imagery. The more random the better. Let it drift, rejecting anything that might start to form a rational narrative. Instead of emptying the mind. Fill it. Overload it. But don't fixate on anything. Always move to the next random object, image, sound, word, color, smell, or feeling.If you're someone who sees colors and patterns or blobs of visual feedback when you close your eyes, all the better. Watch the patterns move while you free associate.I've been doing this for a few months now, and it works for me each time. Might be worth a try if you're stuck awake and wanting to sleep.
Signal	Recently the last couple weeks I've been having major sleep anxiety. Whenever I am able to close my eyes for sleeping though, while I'm still awake I see extremely vivid videos playing like I'm in vr. It's really strange to me because as soon as I open my eyes it stops and it only happens when I'm trying to sleep. It's not a psychotic episode. It doesn't effect me at all throughout the day until I go to sleep. It feels like my brain thinks it's asleep and dreams before I actually am.
Signal	Had an escalating anxiety attack in my dream just now. That's never happened before. It felt just on the edge of overwhelming me, when the trigger stopped. Is nowhere free from this crap? Honestly. I mean, my nights are already bad in their own hellish ways, but why the anxiety too now? Ugh. I can't deal with this life.
NotSignal	I know of r/sleep. But would love to discover more areas and see if there is new information that could be of help :)
NotSignal	I jus need help goin to sleep, I don’t know if it’s insomnia or what it is, but I can’t sleep through the night. If I go to sleep around 11pm I usually wake up at 2am in the morning. But sometimes I can’t even go to sleep. I was feeling like I was going to fall asleep while I was watching something because I usually try to watch something a little to help go to sleep, but it didn’t work but since then I’ve been up for 3 hours in the dark trying to find a way to go to sleep, this is not the first time this has happened, I tried meditation video, and a bunch of other stuff but it just doesn’t work, I need any advice on helping me go to sleep!!!!
Signal	hi! ive recently been diagnosed with a lung problem and it goes without saying that my anxiety about my illness has been through the roof ever since the quarantine started. last week i didnt sleep for 4 days straight and i really, really couldnt despite being on mirtazapine. it cycles around being anxious about my health, the thought of how my lack of sleep could worsen it, and then i wont be able to doze off at all - not even a drop of drowsiness.to those who have been struggling with something similar, care to share methods that worked for you? i tried meditating, more sleeping pills (i was on mirtazapine, risperidone, melatonin, and diphenhydramine all at once last night. they didnt seem to work), sleep hygiene. am i a lost cause? i used to sleep so easily before my illness and the pandemic. :---(
NotSignal	at night, literally anything will set me off. i’ll hear my window creak and assume someone is trying to kidnap me, so i’ll lock myself in my closet for an hour. or like, i’ll convince myself there’s a man with a gun in the house, an nobody can convince me otherwise until i go to bed.when i wake up and look back on it, i always feel so stupid cause it’s obvious everything was fine. like of course i was safe. but in the moment it feels so real and nothing convince me i’m wrong. like all logic goes out the windowit also only ever happens at night when i’m having an insomnia episode
Signal	I’ve only gotten probably 8 hours of sleep total the last 3 nights, I’m exhausted and I still can’t sleep because my anxiety is through the roof. I worry about not being able to fall asleep and then I can’t sleep. Please help. Any suggestions at all would be helpful.
NotSignal	I had to take an antibiotic (oracea, doxycycline) and the 3d week of taking it my insomnia started. 5 weeks after stopping it and the insomnia is still here. I almost certainly have gut issues, since I get bloated very easily and one time I ate corn and half hour later my stomach was killing me and my rosacea flared. Tomorrow I have an appointment with a gastroenterologist.
Signal	I’ve always been a light sleeper. The older I’ve gotten, the more difficult it’s been for me to maintain a healthy sleep length. My problem is that I tend to sleep in short bursts — I will go to bed between 10-11 pm, fall asleep between 11-12, but I will wake up around 2am. If I’m lucky, I’ll manage to fall back asleep for a couple of hours, but only with the assistance of a sleeping pill. I simply cannot fall back asleep if I’ve had even the slightest amount of sleep.I currently use white noise earbuds (Bose sleepbuds), I have tried a weighted blanket, various extremely comfortable pillows, CBD and THC (both exclusively and together), sleep hygiene, melatonin, valerian root, diet restriction, and I don’t drink much coffee (only one and it’s done by 830am or so), exercise, etc. My doctor prescribed sleeping pills after sending me for a blood test and a sleep study. The sleep study showed I had no apnea’s, but I had poor sleep quality and didn’t really hit REM that much. I’m careful with the sleeping pills in that I never take more than half my prescribed dosage, but they truly are the only thing that works with any degree of consistency.Have any of you experienced a similar struggle? What did you do to fix it?
Signal	At the end of May I used to sleep very little (1 to 2h per night) and I wasnt feeling well after that. I had headaches, I felt dizzy, drunk and in the morning I would always feel a big wave of sleepiness (but would never be able to fall asleep) Now, i don’t think that the problem is gone, but I feel like I sleep very little and sometimes (very rarely) get a solid chunk of sleep of like 2-3 hours. For some reasons, I don’t feel sleep deprived anymore, I even feel good during the day, ok I feel a bit tired but only to a normal extend? I don’t even have a small headache. I’ve stopped to take any kind of medication for 5 days now but it wasnt better when I was taking meds. In the last few days I started to worry less and less because I told myself that If i don’t feel sick, its good. But even with acceptance, its not getting better...
NotSignal	I feel terrible most of my life - often too terrible to do anything but lay in bed (and I physically can’t even nap when this happens!).I really, really relate to a lot of content on the chronic illness forum. Wondering if anyone else’s insomnia is so bad that they feel this way?
Signal	I never suffered with insomnia. I always went to sleep late (4am) but I would sleep at least 6 hours. I would suffer from it when my anxiety was worse but nothing that would went on for a long period of time. Two weeks ago (maybe around Christmas) I started having hard time sleeping, I would sleep like 3 hours, wake up and then sleep more 4 hours but always waking up. It's getting a bit worse to be honest, I had a panic attack a few nights ago because of this and slept 1 hour. The night next I was tired but not even sleepy to sleep. I ended up falling asleep at 4 am and woke up at 7 am, and then had some "mini naps".I know the fatal insomnia is a really issue here and normal for anyone who starts having insomnia, and I'm going through that phase unfortunately. Just the thought of going to sleep makes me anxious. Closing my eyes gives me anxiety. Anyway, my "symptoms" right now are: anxiety, feeling tired but not sleepy even after not sleeping for a long time, headache, twitches sometimes, fast heart rate. I also have vivid dreams. I find it odd that this started so suddenly and it's scaring me. Also, on a side note, this night I don't even know if I slept. Like, I was dreaming but it felt so real because I felt like I was thinking about it? I don't know if I was dreaming or just in that phase of almost asleep, for the most of the night.
NotSignal	Hey all I really need some help with this. It all started when I was unknowingly having something with caffeine in it for a week or so. It was one of those crystal light squirt drink mixers. I was having it right before bed and it has completely fucked up my sleep ever since. I’m very sensitive to caffeine. I have been hearing about sleep restrictive therapy and I think that’s probably the best way to go about it, but I’m wanting to hear other inputs too. Thanks!
NotSignal	Hi all. My doctor last year prescribed me nortriptyline to help with my chronic chest pain, but also to help me sleep through the pain at night because it keeps me up and I never get much sleep. I was scared to take it because of all the horrible side effects I have read about so I never took it. She recently just recommended for me to give it a try this time and she just prescribed me it again, 10 to 20 mg once a night. I think it should be important to also say that I take 2400 mg of Gabapentin daily, and also take around 8-10 mg of Dilaudid daily. That worried me because I also have read about Serotonin toxicity/syndrome being a possibility that could come into play because I am adding a new drug into my system that could cause that. Am I overthinking? could this drug hurt me or help me and should I give it a try at the 10 or 20 mg range? Just looking for advice. Thanks!
NotSignal	u/LuckySweats posted a pretty definitive statement about ending it irl in a veteran group. If any of you know who the user is irl please contact the closest police and VA to them. I think they live in Detroit.
Signal	First night I took 10mg and slept well. Second night did some thing but only fell asleep for an hour or so then woke why would this happen i ate a meal kinda near bed time maybe that was a bad idea anyone else get this
Signal	I took melatonin for several years I was able to sleep well. Since I read they don’t know the long term side effects I stopped a month ago. Now I’m asleep by 3:30 am but the problem is I need to wake up at 10am or sometimes earlier. I can never get to sleep sooner without melatonin even if I’m in bed early like 8pm. It’s very frustrating.
Signal	I’ve had chronic insomnia since I was a kid and haven’t found anything non-prescription that works regularly. The best is diphenhydramine for drowsiness (Zquil) but it makes me itchy for some reason. I take 5 mg of melatonin in gummy form regularly so I stay asleep for a longer period of time, but sometimes it has the reverse effect and makes me incredibly hyper and anxious. DAE experience this?
NotSignal	Anyone else feel like their brain is on fire? Not brain zaps but like a constant buzzing that won’t let you ever get sleepy? I don’t have a fever so it’s not actually hot but i can feel something physically buzzing/discomfort in my brain. It’s not pain or headache either.
Signal	I'm a 17 year old female and I've been suffering with insomnia for a few years now. I normally go through periods where i can manage it, but then sometimes it comes back in full swing. Right now I'm in the middle of one of the worst periods of insomnia I've had. Ive tried meditation, burning lavender incense, I've been prescribed meds, but none of it seems to help. It's having a really awful effect on my mental and physical health and I can't stress enough how much I hate feeling like this. What are things i can do to help myself fall asleep or at least handle this better?
Signal	Been suffering from recurrent bouts of insomnia for a few years now alongside significant job stress (the two are related but not directly linked). I recently had two infections which is rare in immunocompetent people. I've had a healthy immune system all my life and never had this sort of problem before.Anyone have similar issues related to lack of sleep?

NotSignal	I get cold really easily, and my bedsheets are freezing when I first get into bed. Even if I'm lucky enough to feel sleepy, as soon as I get under the covers the cold just wakes me up. I'll turn the heating on, but then the room gets hot but the bed is still freezing cold. I also try wearing socks and shit but it doesnt help much. The only thing that (kinda) works is hot water bottles - but it's a pain in the ass and they burn me sometimes. Its driving me crazy. What else can I do to make my bed warm? I can't afford a bedjet, I'm saving up for one.
NotSignal	Hello Reddit, for the last month I have come to experience a case of insomnia where, when I try to sleep in my room I struggle to fall asleep and generally only rest for approximately 5h but if I sleep in my girlfriends house or any other place I can automatically fall asleep and have a decent amount of rest.What is happening and what can I do to change this. I'm thinking of seeking a psychologists help but wanted to see first if anyone here has experience something similar and what have they done to reverse this.
NotSignal	Realizing the fact that you cannot make yourself sleep (i.e. you cannot make it happen by conscious decision/effort) is the first step to slowing down your anxiety.When I had my insomnia at its worst, I realize that I am a perfectionist and that I easily get frustrated especially by things beyond my control (including falling asleep and bad teammates in a MOBA game). I thought that I can make myself sleep despite being aroused too much with the game near bedtime and constantly shifting my sleeping pattern due to my addiction with the game.I am still a perfectionist and though my frustration tolerance is quite better now, I still lose control. The essential thing I only did was I categorically compartmentalize the concept of sleep from other things (by realizing the truth that I cannot make myself sleep).CBT-I has a number of techniques that can really help your insomnia (unless it's a physiological one). So before you try anything else including sleep study, try CBT-I first.
Signal	So i’m stuck with insomnia since almost 12 weeks now and last night I applied some CBTI tools like going to bed very late & waking up from your bed after 20 mins If you aren’t asleep. My bedtime was set to 2am and I struggled to keep my eyes opened I was even experiencing some pre sleep “dreams” if you know what I mean. Like thoughts that dosen’t make any sense but they put you to sleep. At 2am I went to bed exausted and when I hit my bed, I couldn’t sleep. I was really tired but I wasn’t sleepy anymore. After 20 mins I got up and sat on the couch to read a book and in less than 5 mins I was sleepy again (struggling to keep my eyes opened and very slow breathing). How do I make my brain unafraid of my bed? How much time will it take to my brain for the negative response to my bed to go away?
NotSignal	Over the last few years I've occasionally had to deal with migraine attacks. Ever since the one I had about a week ago I've been unable to fall asleep. Sleeping pills seem to work with varying results. Have any of you developed insomnia after a migraine? And if so, how long did it affect you and what medication seemed to help?
NotSignal	Cool, major depressive disorder, almost complete social isolation, and now I can't sleep...I'm really loving life right now
Signal	Hi fellow insomniacs/ sleep expertsThe lockdown kinda messed up my sleep pattern for almost month now, I’ve been only starting to feel sleepy at 6am in the morning and wakes up everyday around 3-4pm... it’s really as bad as you can imagine. So two days ago I decided to get melantonin to fix my sleep time. My first try: i took it at 2am, yawned couple times and went to bed shortly after melantonin. But I woke up at 6am, struggled to sleep a bit then proceeded to sleep all till 1pmMy 2nd try: last night I took one capsule around 12midnight, I waited for an hour but I still wasn’t sleepy so I took another one and went to bed. I slept till 5am, woke up from a dream and couldn’t return back to sleep since. I took my third capsule and waited but it’s literally 7am in the morning now and I want to SLEEPPPPP but just can’t. I tried to not use my phone coz I know about the light and how it affects the brain to not feel sleepy but 2hours struggling to sleep makes me so bored. Melatonin just isn’t helping me that well, I also realized, I can’t stay asleep on melantonin, why?? What should I do? Any legit advice guys?
NotSignal	Hi,I've had insomnia issues for as long as I can remember (10+ years, easy). I can fall asleep easily but then I wake up at 3am wired as hell and can't fall back to sleep. I've cut out caffeine, sugar, alcohol along with perfect "sleep hygiene". I've tried every sleeping pill/aide/supplement out there and nothing has worked.In the past week or so, I've been taking 5000IU as soon as I wake up. I started this for COVID purposes but I noticed instantly that I've been sleeping significantly better. I still wake up at 3, but I feel tired and am able to fall asleep after \~20 minutes of reading.There are tons of studies that link Vitamin D deficiency to sleep disorders yet there are tons of Reddit posts that suggest the opposite (Vitamin D supplements causing insomnia).Does anyone have any experience with this? (I know my dosage might be too high but if it's working, there's literally no way 5000IU of Vitamin D is worse for me than chronic insomnia :-) )
NotSignal	don't be like medont take an ambient to sleep knowing in the past that it could be baddon't crash your car a week before because the ambenn made you so groggy you couldn't sleepdon't get another car get a prescription from an md over the phone and take one pill, wear no clothes and crash going 80-90 into a wall and some how survivedon't take ambien. Unless absolutely necdceseaery Im lucky Im still here and nobody is hurt, but the repercussions are massive and will haunt me for life.don't be like me.
Signal	I have taken melatonin for about 6 years, and I built up a problem where I couldn't produce my own melatonin and would wake up once the meds wore off. but recently I tried to break it and developed insomnia. since then I have begun to sleep more and my energy improved. Yay?
NotSignal	Hello Reddit,I have always used weed as a means to fall asleep more easy, as it was basically the only thing that worked for me, i tried all kinds of herbs and teas but nothing made me that calm as weed did. I dont want to use melatonin or any lab made medicines, however high dose melatonin works for me, i feel my melatonin production is not the culprit here, my overactive mind is the real problem, and thats why weed did wonders for me. I have yet to encounter any herb that totally shuts down my overactive thoughts and makes me calm instantly like weed does. I tried most of the teas like chamomile and valerian, i tried meditation, yoga, mindfulness, and i am still practicing these in my daily life, but i need an easy non harmful way to sedate myself before i go to sleep after a busy day. Any recommendations or am i looking for something that doesnt exist?Thanks in advance!
Signal	Hey guys, &#x200B;do you have any tips for insomnia that strikes in the final hours of the night? I've tried a lot, changing my heating timers so its not super warm, earplugs, 100% dark, some light, eye masks, nytol. Eyeing up some melatonin. I've had insomnia since i was a kid but usually the "cant get to sleep" type. now im a grown up with a job that starts at 7:30 i cant keep going waking up this tired. I go to bed at 10-11 so in theory i should be getting 8hr but what im getting is nearer 6hr and 2hr of franctic tossing and turning. &#x200B;any advice greatly received
NotSignal	It may sound stupid, but I've been bullied all my life up until now I'm 20, grew up in a abusive home, not to mention have 0 friends. I have really bad nightmares and they scare me and sometimes make me cry, they are so vivid and real i swear it actually happend to me. Afterwards i can't sleep so i stay up all night and do nothing. This has been going on no word of a lie for about 2 almost 3 years i can't even remember the last time I had a good amount of rest, I refuse to sleep now because of this anxious feeling i have, It's been really stressing me out and i believe the stress has also added on to it being worse now.
Signal	Hey guys I’m an 18 year old who first noticed sleeping changed around last September, I ignored it for the most part and I think since a few months it was getting kinda better.Last week randomly with no apparent reason I was up till 7 am and had to take melatonin to fall asleep.I’m off the melatonin but since then everything I always wake up around 5-6am for absolutely no reason at all. I then find it very difficult to fall back asleep and if I do it is a very light sleep. I sleep around 12 and I’ve noticed that if I take a 3mg of melatonin I will sleep without waking up till around 9. In the day I constantly have this dull forehead headache which I don’t know is cause by my sleep.Feeling tired and not sleepy is also a problem. Any idea on how I can stop waking up at night.Any help is greatly appreciated
NotSignal	I have half a brain when I sleep six hours or less, and it's the worst experience in my life. I can see my reduced brain capacity in action, my body and my head hurt all the time and so rare are the days when they don't. This has been happening for nearly two years now. I kept trying but this is like a black hole and it's too much, it seems that I can't myself get out of it.I have been trying and crossing things off the list, slowly, as I'm going by in this condition. There's one main thing that always keeps me up and wakes me up and I still can't find a solution for: noise.Fellow fighters, what are your experiences with noise, and solutions if any ,?
NotSignal	The main issues I'm having is falling asleep and I wake up 4 am every day for the last week and a half will not sleeping all night tonight reset my sleep pattern?.
Signal	I don't see many people report hunger on this medication, but for those who do, I haven't seen any reports that the hunger goes away. I tried this drug once, didn't like it principally for this reason, and decided after awhile to try it again, only to experience the same appetite increase. I'm on another med right now that is very activating (fluoxetine) and is creating the worst insomnia ever. Doctors often prescribe this, and I wanted it to work, even a little, but I already tend to overeat even without Trazodone, so this is doubly stressful. Fluoxetine was actually helping my hunger stabilize, but Trazodone seems to undo this. Does anyone know if this side effect (increased hunger from Trazodone) ever goes away?
Signal	It’s been four days. No sleep. I don’t know what to do anymore. I hate my life.
Signal	For as long as i can remember i’ve had trouble sleeping. In the past 2 years it got worse, I wouldn’t be able to sleep until 3 am or so. But suddenly the past 2 weeks have been awful, most nights I can’t sleep until 6 or 7 am, and some nights I just don’t sleep at all. It’s getting to the point where i have constant anxiety due to lack of sleep. I used to use melatonin but now it has no affect on me at all.
NotSignal	A little bit ago was real fuckin tired and yet I couldn’t sleep. That’s pretty normal for me, I can’t sleep at all unless I’m already sleep deprived or I stay up late enough until I am sleep deprived. Fast forward 5-10 minutes, I was really sad over something completely unrelated and started crying. I cry myself to sleep often, especially recently. Usually crying would make me tired and would help me fall asleep but not tonight, now I’m more awake than ever. I wake up in less than 3 hours. please help me
Signal	I have a huge event at work today and have anxiety/insomnia in the best of times... I need to sleep, but my brain just won't shut off! I feel like I've tried everything. Sleeping pills, melatonin, exercise, a sleep mask with built in headphones, etc.WHY does this happen when I need sleep the most???
NotSignal	Im addicted to screens. I only realized when I just recently went on vacation and stayed in a little house in a national park (no signal). I didn’t have games either on my phone so I just laid there and slept from like 11 pm to 8 am when I usually go from 2 am to 5 am.I think that being in a quiet place might have also helped since I live in a pretty big city.Everybody says you shouldn’t look at screens when you are trying to sleep, but I cant help it. When I don’t look at screens I only have negative thoughts (depression) and cry.Screens distract me.I wanted to know If someone actually made the switch and saw a difference in their sleeping pattern. Im start working on March and I’m afraid I don’t get enough sleep and that affects my behavior 😕
Signal	I've heard of people hallucinating or getting delirious with severe lack of sleep - but I've never experienced it - until now.I'm going on a little over a month of not being able to sleep at night. I will fall asleep for maybe an hour, but I'm never fully asleep. I'm still completely conscious and aware of any and everything going on around me, which makes for some very confusing dreams.But the last week or so I have realized that if I am home alone, and it is quiet, I SWEAR I can hear music playing. Like a faint, mundane pattern type of music, like it's really far away and it's just playing the same melody over and over. The weird thing is, it takes me a few minutes of this happening to realize that A) There IS NO music actually playing that I can hear, and B) that I totally just sat there not even realizing I was imagining it. I can't take sleeping pills, have tried melatonin, and other than smoking myself stupid tonight, I have no idea what else to do. I am so used to it at this point that I feel like I'm on auto-pilot.
Signal	Since forever I’ve never slept well ofc... anyways recently i came to the conclusion that I only sleep well in the morning specially when i need to get up. I think its because since i lay awake all night tosing and turning and when its time to wake up, i become conscious of how tired ive become from not sleeping all night hence me sleeping for real in the mornings.Does anyone here experience this?Ive tried lowercase pills such as Benadryls (low or high dose) and recently i got vistaril but these work literally one day for me. I am aware its that my body builds up resistance but idk benzos scare me.
Signal	Man, I’ve been doing so much better lately. But here I am, almost 5 am and I’ve been wide awake for 2 hours. My husband will take our 8 week old puppy out when he gets up for work, but I’m anxious that my lack of sleep/need to get any sleep I can will make me a bad dog mom today. This is an issue I hadn’t even thought about before. Damn anxiety and insomnia.
NotSignal	I think my middle ear infections are keeping me up. The pressure in my ears is ridiculous. Every time I try to fall asleep I become very nauseous and feel like I’ve lost all weight to my body. I’m on the verge of vomiting now from nausea. While sleeping I remember my dreams, which means I’m waking during the REM stage. I’ve only slept from 3-4am and 6-7am. It’s 7:40am now. I’ve been trying to sleep since 12am. I wake up abruptly and then can’t fall back asleep. Why is this happening? How can I stay asleep? This is happening every night but tonight has been the worst night. This is torture. Please help. I’m afraid to take my Hydoxyzine because if I need my Meclizine I wouldn’t be able to take it since they interact with one another.
NotSignal	I got a ghost app on my phone and every time I use it, I get drained and knocked out and sleep for hours. At first I thought the ghosts were draining my energy and that’s why I was able to sleep but now I’m starting to think it’s the repetitive static that knocks me out. Has anyone tried this?
NotSignal	God damned pussies, you got 9 hours of sleep last night, i got 9 hallucinations due to severe lack of sleep and still was more coherent. I hate sleepers im so fucking jelly...
NotSignal	I have a problem where I wake up at 4:30 every single morning and I am filled with restless energy so that I cannot fall back asleep. This happens regardless of what time I go to sleep, but it generally takes me a long time to fall asleep so I am not really getting enough rest. This has been going on for months and I’m kind of at my wits end. Is there like a specific name for this or is it a symptom of a larger problem? It makes no sense, I feel fine otherwise and have never had this problem before.
NotSignal	Has acid reflux/stomach issues kept you up all night? Lately, I've been having severe acid reflux attacks, 3 in the past couple of months. I will be getting a ultrasound of my gullbladder next week as GB stones run in my family. Anyways, the 'attacks' last roughly 20-30 mins. In this time, I have severe pain in my middle chest area and upper back. Also, my anxiety is at an all time high. These attacks wake me up in the middle of the night and after it is over I can not fall back to sleep. I still feel my adrenaline pumping and I'm scared it will happen again. Anyone else experience this?Sidenote: I have been seeing a nutritionist since June 2019 and have lost 40 lbs. My diet is much better but I sometimes overindulge in unhealthy things which obviously can trigger my stomach pain.
NotSignal	0 sleep and been awake for hours now. Gotta get up in like 4-5 hours too. Ugh
Signal	I’m asking mainly the crowd who’s stuck at home. I’ve had a ton of sleepless nights and it’s driving me crazy.I posit this can be for two reasons:1.) Im sitting down for a lot of the dayAlthough I do try and go out for hikes and also lift weights almost every day, I still spend so much time inside sitting down. I’m thinking that since I’m not really using any energy during the day, my body isn’t tiring out as much.2.) The constant stream of news and nature of the pandemic itselfThis is definitely an uncomfortable time and it’s changed my life (and many others) drastically. I think this adds to the anxiety which prevents me from sleeping What do you guys think? Do you relate?
Signal	the cycle of being too anxious to sleep then being anxious about not getting enough sleep is eating me alive. i’ve been awake for two days straight, this is fucking bullshit. i am unraveling
NotSignal	I will go to bed now, so wish me luck. You should also go to bed soon, I wish you a restfull time. I really do. Good night.
Signal	I’m getting really suicidal. I’ve been getting less than 5 hours of sleep this last week. I can’t do any of the stuff that I like / need to do. I’ve tried employing all the steps of sleep hygiene, but it doesn’t seem to make any difference. I’ve been on melatonin too. I want to try CBTI, but it’s really expensive ($200 a session, from what I’ve seen). All I see on this subreddit are posts from other people sounding as hopeless / angry as myself. If you can give me some kind of hope (and maybe a tip) I’d be grateful
Signal	I'm resistant to pretty much all sleep aids, and have run the gambit on all of them. Because I cycle at 96 hours awake, 3-4 asleep, rinse and repeat, my blood pressure spiked and my doctor fears I'm depressed, even though I explained that my depression comes from not being able to sleep / function and I've made good with PTSD.So, mirtazapine. It's supposed to lower blood pressure, help with PTSD, and has the side effect of knocking you out. I'm taking 45mg a night and sleeping a full solid 5 hours, which is the most I've slept in my life.But I feel off. Groggy during the day - not insanely so, but enough where I feel a bit sluggish, and it's really given me an appetite. I haven't been on it long, but I'm curious if any of you have played with it, and how the effects are in the long run.
Signal	I noticed a pattern, on my days off I sleep just fine, even though I stay up late. Afterwork if I come home and sleep in the afternoon I sleep great too. I noticed I was sleeping better in the daytime, and tossing and turning at night. On my days off I would stay up half the night and sleep all day because I figured "I won't sleep anyways" I thought maybe it was my clock changed from working nights, until I realised you cannot change your internal clock which is why people who work graveyard shift have greater risk for all kinds of diseases. So yesterday I found out I didn't have to work today, but instead of staying up all night I decided to go to bed super super early, and I found that I slept so well. Which is unusual.. because during the week I go to bed early and can't sleep. And I realised, that during the week I am stressed out when I go to bed because I know I have to get up early the next day and I fear I won't be rested enough to get up or feel refreshed, so I end up putting an immense pressure on myself to sleep which keeps me up all night. I also worry about not having enough time to sleep, I might try going to bed 10 hours before I have to wake up. Does anyone have any tips on not stressing myself into insomnia? I already read, meditate, and take baths.
Signal	I finally scrounged up enough money to get some melatonin. I’m gonna walk to walgreens tomorrow and get it. I’ll finally be able to s l e e p.
NotSignal	I always see trigger warnings in fictions for self harm, OCD, all that sort. But I hardly ever see ones for insomnia.Sometimes the portrayal of insomnia in fiction, and other works I see. It just makes me miserable, it makes me miserable that that's how insomniacs are portrayed. Sometimes it portrayed as being so immeasurably easy to cure, sometimes characters who only obtain an hour of sleep in a week can function like normal people. Sometimes my classmates think of those as real too, thinking that its a problem so small because of the influence of those medias.These trigger me to some extent, and I feel that it should be more touched upon.
NotSignal	The thc converts to thca 99% in the extraction process. Once fully extracted the thc will be orally active. However besides eating it, it can be vaped or even dipped on a cigarette. One drop will have you questioning if your good or not, for the first 15 mins... after you have waited these 15 minutes you will realize your anxiety has been lifted, your mind feels free, your soul will feel light, and you will be able to focus more steadily.The biggest benefit to me will be microdosing. If I microdose one of 3 things may happen.. I can A.) Calm down and forget what it's like to feel pain, B.) Take too much and fall asleep c.)walk around walmart unaware of everyone else while eating chips. I always wondered if I could microdose with weed. It was unapparent until I figured out how to do it. I just had to figure out how to feel anything with such small doses. The crazy think about 99% thc is I have to take the smallest hit in the world for it to not fuck me up. However my point in reading this article is strictly to let everyone know I've been looking for a solution to my lack of sleep and I have to say the best thing is to put a drop of the distillate under my tongue and take a few, maybe three, really good hits off my pen. That being said I really learned alot reading this article. I learned that 99% thc essentially 990 mgs per ml. I also learned that it is extremely easy to make given the right equipment. (If you have alot of trim and a rosin press you can collect 150 grams for every kilo of trim. And the absolutely most valuable lesson I learned was, please abuse the F*ck out of it before you lay down, and you will go to sleep.P.s. wrote this on a manic. Sorry if it doesnt make sense.
NotSignal	I feel a lot of my sleep is deprived by hot feet. I’ve googled it, I surely know I don’t have diabetes. Nonetheless, does anyone else have this? Extremely hot feet at night? Or even needing to sleep in nothing but a sheet with a fan on high in your underwear.

NotSignal	I was hooked on stimulants for two years finally got off them, months ago. The sleeping issues didn’t sleep and my body is trained to go days without sleeping, kinda starting to lose my mind.
NotSignal	I have this insomnia going on for days and I toss and turn and can find no peace , however it seems that I have breaks of sleep because I have dreams , and then I ask myself : is it possible to dream while awake or was I really asleep? Does anybody feel the same?
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for years now and had meds to help. A new doctor just took me off of everything and i’ve been off everything for about 8 months. I’m currently sick and not sleeping well, have a number of things also going on. And today I had sleep paralysis which scared me to death. My anxiety meds that he also took me off of now is causing me to freak out and not sleep...
Signal	Hoping someone can help me out. i’m 23/F and before all the quarantine stuff i was sleeping relatively normally other than a sleepless night here and there but nothing that was impacting my life. Now since i’ve been home i’ll be the first to admit my life schedule has gone out the window. I now have no job and the overly hot weather has made getting out and about impossible for days on end so my days consist of going to bed pretty late (between 2 and 3am) and then staying laying in bed even after waking up until around 2:30pm. So i’m eating at weird times and sleeping at weird times too. Although before the last month I wasn’t having any issues with this. I would go to bed late and sleep in late without issue. But now the last month when I go to sleep late I wake up after a few hours (usually about 4-5 hours after falling asleep) and i’m wide awake in bed and can’t fall back to sleep for a long time if at all. Tonight for example I fell asleep around 2:30am and woke up an hour later and have been awake ever since with increasing anxiety. I’ve tried reading, having a snack, listening to soothing audios and everything and yet I can’t fall asleep and my heart is pounding. I’m starting to get really freaked out that this is the beginning of a life of insomnia and i don’t know what to do. I’m just doing the same things i’ve always done with no problems but now i just can’t sleep. What could be causing this and what can I do to stop it???
NotSignal	Whenever im about to fall asleep, my heart begins fo sink for no reason and then it starts pounding out of control and wakes me right back up. Whats happening????
NotSignal	That happens to me. The light literally hurts and causes me headache, I have to shut all the windows.
NotSignal	It’s been too me hell of a week and I just can’t get any sleep. I was up at:30Am yesterday to catch a flight to my grandfather’s wake. Didn’t sleep really on the flight, got maybe 20 minutes in after I landed then had to go to the wake. I’ve now bee just crying for about the last half and hour after holding it all in and I can’t s em to fall asleep.
Signal	So the past few weeks I’ve been trying to fix my sleep schedule because it went a little haywire when quarantine began. But strangely now I’ll go to sleep at my usual time which is 12pm. Normally I get up at 8am because I need my 8 hours or I’ll be exhausted. But now I always naturally without an alarm get up at 7 or 6 am. This causes me to be super groggy and tired throughout the day and not want to get anything done. Coupled with that now when I try and get a nap during the day I get sleep paralysis episodes and can’t get some sleep. I always suffered from them when I don’t sleep well but it’s not very nice getting them now when I am actually trying to sleep regularly. I just woke up from one now and I’m writing this because I’m so fed and I don’t understand why this is happening.I went to sleep at 10.30 last night because I probably only got 4 hrs of sleep the previous night so I was hoping to “catch up” on sleep I had missed. I was expecting to sleep at least an extra 3 hrs but lo and behold I woke up at 6am. I stopped drinking coffee a while ago because I noticed my body just doesn’t metabolise it well. I’ve tried doing vigorous exercise earlier in the day. I’ve taken vitamin D supplement which I was likely deficient in and I’ve googled everything that could possibly be the problem and still nothing. I’m in my last year of “high school” and it’s a pretty important year and I’m scared this is going to continue when I start school again and I’m gonna be tired all the time and it’s going to affect my academics. Please help.
Signal	When i go to sleep i wake up not less than half an hour later, is this bad??? Literally so freaked out.
Signal	I feel like every time I get a system that works for me my body gets the signal that it’s time to fuck my shit up again. Melatonin, Cbd, skullcap, valerian toot, antihistamines, anti hypertensives, ambien, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, alcohol, thc, sleep mask, sleep headphones, ear plugs, boring audio books, darkness/quiet/stillness, working out, falling asleep with the tv on, heat, cold, alone, with my partner, meditating, flailing angrily in the dark because I’m tired... so fucking tired of being tired, so done with feeling like this is just never going to end. I have an appointment with sleep medicine intake in October, but I’m worried all I’m going to get out of that’s is a huge bill and being told I don’t have sleep apnea. I hate this so much
Signal	It’s like a really heavy feeling. If I have to get up to go to the bathroom, I walk a little weird I think. I can’t explain the sensation I get on this, but I HATE it. I can’t take benzos anymore because I have a history of abusing them. This is the ONLY med I’ve taken for sleep (well besides unisom) that gives me this feeling. It happens at 100 and 150 mg. My psychiatrist tried me at 75 mg and that was THE WORST. I was tired but couldn’t sleep - it was like being stuck in limbo, literally. And 50 mg does not make me sleepy at all.Gonna probably make a separate post about all the meds I’ve tried and what people suggest I try next. I just want to know with this post if anyone else has similar feelings. All the other meds I’ve tried for sleep are more sedating. This isn’t at all!
Signal	I’ve been put on a 4 day trial of zopiclone to try and correct my sleeping habits. I haven’t slept right for years. I think I was around 7 or 8 when I first took melatonin. So it’s always been an issue for me. I’ve tried everything from herbal tea to magnesium, melatonin, Quetiapene and Amitriptyline and now zopiclone. I do a huge amount of exercise as I play sport for a highly competitive level. I’ve tried reading and sleeping with no tv but I still struggle to fall asleep. I took one tablet of the zopiclone the first night to feel nothing and two the next night to feel nothing and the 3rd night I tried 2 and half which my doctor didn’t advise and I slept the best I ever have. Do you guys have any advice or other medication I can request my doctor for since I know zopiclone is for short term use only. Thanks for any help guys.
NotSignal	hi everyone, i wasn't sure where to post this so i chose this subreddit because it's probably the most fitting for what's going on! my (20F) boyfriend (21m) never sleeps, and i care about him a lot and this worries me! he has depression/anxiety (just a disclaimer because i know both of those things can cause restlessness), and he usually goes to bed at like 3/4 am, and wakes up around 12-2pm (not to mention he won't be fully asleep this entire time, he wakes up periodically). for the past couple of weeks, however, he's been going to bed much past 3 am, like he went to bed around 10 am the other day and 8 am this morning. does anyone have any tips or help on how to combat or reduce some insomnia? he takes melatonin sometimes, has even tried benadryl, bedtime teas, and nothing seems to significantly help him. at night before he goes to bed he falls asleep to a podcast on his TV, so i'm sure some of the 'blue light' has something to do with it but obviously it probably isn't contributing too much. i care about him a lot and i wish i could help him, so that's why i'm asking in here! i've mentioned possibly talking to a doctor about this, because his sleep patterns are far from normal and that can be unhealthy in the long term. so, if anyone has tips or ideas on how to help, that would be greatly appreciated!!! thank you :)
Signal	Hi everyone,For the past few months, I've been suffering from some crippling sleep issues where I was only getting 2-4 hours of sleep a night on most nights.. A restful night's sleep was increasingly a distant memory for me. I was exacerbated and decided to read about how to deal with insomnia from this book called The Effortless Sleep Method by Sasha Stephens, who herself had chronic insomnia for over 15 years. I set everything aside and read the book in 1 day. I've been following the guidance in the book for a week now, and it's honestly been extremely helpful in curing my insomnia. Part of the reason why it's been so helpful is because Stephens takes a no bullshit approach where she spends the first half of the book asking the reader to do some deep inner reflection about how our own psychology and thinking about insomnia contribute to our sleep problems. I especially identified with her approach when she said that people with insomnia tend to think that their problem is fundamentally unique and somehow beyond repair, and that this leads us to imagine that we need some "external" cure to help us sleep, because we come to believe that we are incapable of doing it on our own. For example, "external" cures, like sleeping aids, are not immune from failure, and will at some point let us down, which only exacerbates our thinking that we are somehow beyond repair and that we need to search for yet another "magic" pill, herb, supplement, etc. to finally give us a good night's rest. Stephens argues that the key to recovery lies in resetting our thinking about insomnia and trusting our body's natural desire to sleep. She walks the readers through her argument in a really convincing and powerful way, and urges insomniacs to turn their "bullshit meter" down just a tad, trust the holistic approach she outlines, and give it time to work. I highly recommend giving it a read!
NotSignal	should i call 911? i don’t have any anti anxiety meds on me and it’s 2:37 am i’m freaking out everything seems so scary please help me
Signal	I have these little micro sleeps but wake up almost immediately. I toss and turn. And eventually give up. I am on medication for OCD / anxiety, have been for years now, and it’s always given me some insomnia issues, but nothing like this. I have restless leg syndrome, but it feels like it’s all over my body! I teach kindergarten and the last few days after no sleep, have been a nightmare. I’m also a mom and I feel like I can’t parent right now. I just come home, abandon my husband and kids and lay down and try to sleep. Right now I’m taking a hot bath and I think I just had a micro dream that I was having a conversation with someone. I can hear my husband snoring in the next room and it makes me angry, lol. I took a Benadryl right before the bath and now I’m thinking I should get out before I drown... wish me luck...
Signal	I don’t have it as badly as a lot of people here, and I’m thankful for that, but it’s definitely becoming a problem that’s starting to effect my life. I can’t for the life of me go to sleep before about 6 to sometimes 9AM, and if I manage to fall asleep at a normal time, I wake up two hours later. I feel really tired all day, but at night when I try to go to sleep I’m wide awake. I’m ABLE to fall asleep, so I think the 6AM thing is more about my schedule being fucked up, but what should I do about staying asleep?
Signal	I have a circadian rhythm disorder called "Delayed Sleep-Phase Syndrome" where no matter what I do, my days are my nights & my nights are my days. It's a very lonely disorder. I can sleep, but not until the sun's been up a while then nothing can wake me up until about 4PM. I set 4 alarms & take amphetamines (adderall, prescribed) an hour before I want to wake up but it does nothing. However, the pharmacy screwed me this week and I went 2 days w/o them & I slept almost constantly, which wouldn't be so bad if I didn't ONLY have nightmares. To top it off, my husband of 25 years has heard it all & doesn't do anything to make me feel better when I'm still scared shitless when I wake up. Wah, wah wah. I guess I'm just hoping someone on here identifies.
Signal	For a long while I’ve had insomnia it only just started to get to me and annoy the actual living fuck out of me at first I wasn’t that bad before now and then maybe I feel a sleep at like 1 but now I’m not even tiered and it’s almost FUCKING 4am it does not even help that my eyes can’t just stay shut and have to open for no fucking reason and it’s getting so so much on my nerve cause I lay down for .003 secs and then my eyes fucking opens and there goes any tiredness had so how do stop this meds don’t work I’ve tried everything I could like not using my phone before going to bed and it doesn’t
NotSignal	All day I want to sleep. I try to nap but can't.Around 9pm however I am wide the fuck awake and stay that wayI don't get it. I sleep maybe 2 hours a night and I'm really fucking sick of it.
Signal	I’ve been an insomniac since middle school- didn’t start being properly medicated until my late 20’s. Early 20s I would use my anxiety medication I was prescribed to be able to sleep until I stopped taking klonopin. I’ve tried: sleepy time teas, waking up early, being active throughout the day to try to “wear myself out” any and every OTC sleep aid, melatonin, Kava tea- you name it I’ve tried it. A few years ago after going to my primary doctor and doing a sleep journal for a couple months per his instructions I was finally prescribed Ambien which worked so long as I didn’t eat four hours prior to taking it. It didn’t work alone though- I still had to take an OTC sleep aid in conjunction with the Ambien. After a couple years on it I’d have broken sleep- waking up having panic attacks, and sleep paralysis. Now I talked to my psychiatrist about this along with the panic attacks and he prescribed restoril/temazepam which I thought would be for when I panic attacks would wake me up (that worked GREAT) & come to find out no, he took me off of the ambien my primary prescribed and the pharmacist would no longer fill my ambien. So now I’m on restoril which is a benzodiazepine that I would have to go into a detox to stop taking! If I was asked for my input I’d suggest raising my dose of ambien and stay far from a benzo to take every night. Now, the restoril is no longer working and I’m at the end of my rope & not falling asleep until the sun is coming up- adding to my anxiety. What medications or tips have worked for my fellow insomniacs ? I can’t take it much longer
NotSignal	For the past 2 weeks, I've been struggling with silencing my mind and thoughts so I can sleep. My mental health hasn't been good lately, and I'm trying pretty hard not to get into depression by doing yoga, eating healthy, etc. But everytime I lay on the bed to sleep, my mind just automatically goes into a loop or spiral of thoughts. There's no end result, just the same thoughts over and over again. I've had some skeletons in my closet, and it's mostly those incidents reverberating.I tried meditating, having warm milk, herbal tea. Nothing seems to work. Some nights my eyes are red and heavy due to lack of sleep, but I still can't silence my mind.Any other home remedies or practices I can maybe try out? I don't want to rely on sleeping pills. Thanks in advance!
NotSignal	So I try to sleep early but after 1-2 hours I start sweating and feeling hot and wake up and am unable to sleep after that. My body thermostat is wrecked I feel cold w/o blanket but hot w/ it after some time.
NotSignal	do you get muscle pains after a almost sleepless night?mine hurt everytime i cant sleep and its so annoying..i tred so much allready, the next thing i will try is to sleep with open window..
Signal	I have had a hard time with sleeping for a while now mostly due to my bipolar psychosis last year around dying in my sleep. I finally came off of Klonopin after tapering off 2 months which I started for that problem. I am sleeping with melatonin now and trying to get my sleep back on track. My girlfriend wants to start sleeping over her apartment but I keep mine at 64 degrees, strict sleep hygeine, and still struggle to get consistent sleep. I would like to sleep over her place but am nervous about tossing and turning all night. Any suggestions for getting rest in someone else's environment or similar experience?
NotSignal	I've come to see you once again... As my eyelids droop, And my muscles ache - You won't let me go to sleepOh insomnia my old friend.... :( I got too excited with other stuff and now the giddiness won't leave me even though I want to sleep because my dreams are usually fun even if creepy aaaaaaaa I need to fix my sleep schedule tho so today I'm staying up until at least 7/8pm ☕☕☕☕🍵🍵🍵🍵

NotSignal	Drum and bass, the stillness, and my study material all night
Signal	Greetings fellow insomniacs! I've been suffering/recovering from PTSD for the past 20something months, with regular and heavy insomnia as a side effect of that. PTSD I can cope with and manage, but insomnia has been actively destroying my life. I've not been able to maintain any commitments at all, and it's made me feel suicidal on numerous occasions.Yesterday I was prescribed some Zopiclone, I took one in the night and I was asleep within 30 minutes! That much has me shocked and feeling very hopeful.I only slept for 2 and a half hours though, before I woke up because I was having the most vivid dreams I can remember having in a long time! My hope now is to power through the day (I'm up very early), have another one tonight and hope for a more full night's sleep. If I can keep this up for a few days and then stop, perhaps I can develop a routine?I'm cautiously optimistic, but I'm pleasantly surprised to find that despite having little sleep, I have slept! Has anyone else tried this and found similar experiences with dreams?
Signal	**I apologize for the English, I do not know him, so tex, straight from the translator.**Hello, I need your help. People who have recovered / have passed away from insomnia. How did you do it? I have insomnia for 3 months, the 1st month was very difficult, then it got better, but still 1-3 times in two weeks it comes back to me. I already despaired, I feel so bad. I try very hard for it to pass, but it does not pass and it gnaws at me. I heard that people have lived with her for years, I won’t bear it, please reassure me. I don’t remember what type of insomnia I have, but I can’t fall asleep, and if it works, then it’s maximum for half an hour. She appeared with me, most likely due to the fact that I spent half a year living with the regime - you go to bed at 4 am and get up at 3 pm. Toward the end of half a year, I often started to restore normal / return to the old sleep mode and after that insomnia appeared. Thank you in advance for your comments.
Signal	2 nights ago I didn't sleep and then I got 3 hours the next night then I got no sleep last night. The day after no sleep I hiked like 9 miles with friends. I dint realize how exhausted my body was until just a bit ago. I just nearly collapsed onto my floor. Everything hurts now but still can't sleep :/
Signal	I struggle with insomnia that happens every few months. A little bit of background, I have mild anxiety. I also tested positive for covid19 and have been hospitalised for 3 weeks now. The past 3 weeks I have been in good spirits and have managed to fall asleep really easy. Unfortunately, being hospitalised for 3 weeks has also started taking a toll on my emotional health, and for the past few days I’ve been having a lot of anxiety over when I can be discharged from the hospital, crying bouts, and last night, my heart was beating so fast and I felt like I couldn’t breathe even though my vitals were completely fine. The doctor prescribe Xanax to me and I only managed to fall asleep at 6am after tossing in bed for HOURS. I am worried. I don’t want to start depending on xanax to fall asleep. I know it’s the first time in months since I’ve had this but but usually it last for weeks. I’m so scared for tonight. Any tips?
Signal	Hey all...So I've had insomnia most of my life, though it first started noticing it in my early to mid 30s, and it has gotten worse over the years.I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, and rarely feel fully rested in the morning. After some years being addicted to Ambien and valium to help me sleep, I was off for a few years, and my doctor prescribed me Gabapentin, which has helped quite a bit. But not 100%.I find I toss and turn a lot, have a lot of random anxiety and antsy/uncomfortable feelings most nights. I need to feel that I have total control over my sleeping environment to even have a chance of sleeping through the night. I sleep best when in my own room/bed, wearing earplugs and a sleep mask, with my various regular and body-pillows to arrange, so I can move myself around throughout the night to find a good position.I've been with my girlfriend for the last year, but things got more serious about 6 months ago. I told her from the start that I have extreme trouble sleeping, and hoped she would understand that when over at her house, I want to sleep in separate beds. She KIND of understands, but wants me to at least share her bed with her until she falls asleep, and then I can move to the guest bed (in the same room). She sometimes seems to disbelieve me, because I snore loudly, and she takes that as evidence that I'm sleeping better than I actually feel I am.In any case, though I have no problem with intimacy and cuddling and closeness, and can even sometimes fall asleep with her near me when taking a nap during the day, when it is time for sleep at night, it is pretty impossible for me to feel comfortable in bed with her. I have been snuggling with her, trying to stay in her bed until she falls asleep, but sometimes I just can't stand it and HAVE to go to the other bed to feel comfortable. Sometimes she lets me go, sometimes she kind of pleads for me to stay in bed with her a little longer (it can take her an hour or too to be fully asleep, so while I'm waiting for her to fall asleep, I'm just lying in bed with her, kind of seething and unsettled internally, even if I don't show it on the surface).The other night, she told me how nice it was that I stayed in bed with her until she fell asleep. I mistakenly took this as a good opportunity to bring up the fact that, though it might have been nice for her, I was laying next to her just itching to escape to my own bed, a kind of resentment building up inside me that she was "making" me stay there, and that she didn't understand how just unbearable it is for me to try to stay in bed with someone when all I want to do is sleep, and sleep separately so I have that "total control of my environment".Telling her this was a big mistake; she was hurt, almost crying, said I was mean for telling her that right after she had shared how much she loved that I stayed in bed with her that long.Has anyone else had these kind of problems? How have you dealt with them? My last long-term girlfriend also had insomnia, so she could understand it and didn't take it personally. But my current girlfriend seems to not quite understand it.
Signal	Long time insomniac. Started at 14 now 27.does anyone else ever feel like their heart is beating super hard after you've been up for a few days? It's not super fast, seems like my regular pace, I'm just more aware of it beating.Forgive my rambling, I need some sleep
Signal	I‘m a nurse working 13 hour shifts, usually 2 to 4 shifts per week. I have no problem sleeping on my days off or before night shifts, I‘m able to sleep 8+ hours. Even between two night shifts I sleep well. But nearly every night before a day shift I can‘t sleep. If I have two day shifts in a row I sleep maybe 2-3 hours each night, sometimes I can‘t sleep at all. Some days at work are so bad. No time to actually think about the things that are happening, just run and do. After work I am so tired, my legs are swollen and hurt and I feel like I am 60 years old even though I‘m 24. My body is just so so tired, but my mind is buzzing, thinking and just now processing all the things that happened that day. I keep trying to shut off my mind but I can‘t. Then I get annoyed that I can‘t sleep, I keep thinking „If you don‘t sleep now, you will be even more tired tomorrow“. Sometimes I fall asleep but wake up after 2 hours, sweating, feeling anxious and then my mind is buzzing again. Last night I managed to shut up my brain, I was relaxed and looking forward to sleep. I drifted off and was wide awake after a few minutes. I‘m starting to notice the effects of lack of sleep at work. I forget things after a few minutes and can‘t concentrate, I feel like I‘m only physically there. I have very little patience and act cranky and moody. It‘s not that I dread going to work, I dread going to work tired again. It‘s also not the night shifts ruining my rhythm, because I had the same problem at my last job where I didn‘t work night shifts. I‘m also scared of taking sleep medication. I often have patients that take a lot of different sleep medication and they still can‘t sleep, or they do weird or creepy things at night. I‘m scared of becoming that and scared that I won‘t be able to sleep without them. I tried melatonin, sleeping rituals, meditation, not moving for 15 minutes, weighted blankets, writing down my thoughts,... Nothing works. I don‘t know what to do anymore.
Signal	It is currently Sunday the 7th, 5:56AM at the start of this writing. I’m on about 3 hours of sleep since Friday night. For over a decade now, my sleep has been progressively getting worse. I frequently pull all-nighters. It’s affecting my energy, of course, and deteriorating my mental health and stability. I find myself in states like these to be almost manic with constantly looming depression and anxiety, all at the same time. I’ve tried to fall asleep, only to toss and turn and get frustrated and break down crying. I just wish someone was here to tell me I’m okay, and help calm me down. Sigh, tearing up as I write this. It’s such a uniquely helpless feeling that is so intangible yet so heavy on my mind. It becomes a cycle of self-beratement and constant disappointment of “I need to fix this,” “I need to sleep,” “WHY IS THIS SO HARD,” and “I’ll stay up today. Sleep early tomorrow. I’ll get this right.” I feel truly helpless. It’s affecting my relationships. It’s killing my energy and motivation. It exacerbated my anxiety and depression. My memory is shot the f*ck out. And I can’t seem to find a solution, with no one to blame but myself it seems. I feel this brooding desire to cry that comes out when I can’t control it. I find myself with tears coming down my face, not knowing why I’m sad or crying in the first place. It’s clearly affecting my stability and it’s so difficult to combat this in an effective way. The quarantine and unemployment hasn’t helped my case... I’m on my computer pretty much the entire time I’m awake. I probably stay up because of it and I’d agree there, but for the last few months it feels more like I simply don’t feel sleepy so what else is there to do? Not the best logic, I know. But it’s incredibly discouraging when I actually feel sleepy, attempt to sleep at a reasonable time, only to almost instantly lose the sleepiness the second I hit the bed and try to pass out. The *teeeeny* tiny silver lining is that I’ve been seeing a therapist (good for managing and reframing emotions, not very affective for sleep) and that I’ve finally gained access to healthcare after 10 years without. I don’t really know anything about sleep medication so, if anyone has some insight to share about it I’d appreciate it very much (I’ll be doing my own research too and lurk around here a bit!). Im not entirely sure why I’m writing this other than the fact that writing my thoughts down sometimes helps. I hope it portrays one perspective of insomnia, and how difficult it is to live with this. I need help and I’m seeking it, I suppose this is one of the ways I’m doing it. It’d help me tremendously to hear any words of encouragement, knowledge, or just comfort by sharing your struggle. I feel like an incompetent loser that can’t even do something as simple as *sleep*, and everyone in my life seems to have no problem sleeping at all. This just makes me feel like I’m f*cked in the head and something’s wrong with me. I have no way to find solace in the fact that I’m not alone, even if I know there’s millions of strangers who may be going through the same, if not similar thing. It’s nice to have written this out. Thank you for reading the ramblings of a deliriously sleep-deprived sulk. I wish you a deep sleep and a good night’s rest. PS I apologize if this comes off too strong. I’m a very emotional guy and being so sleep-deprived seems to only amplify that trait.
Signal	My doctor thinks I have paradoxical insomnia and thinks I may be sleeping and not realizing it. It may be due to hyperarousal from my anxiety or possibly depression or something. He referred me to a psychiatrist and, after long wait, I finally am going to be able to visit with my psychiatrist and hopefully have a sleep study FINALLY accepted by my insurance once they know I ACTUALLY have depression and anxiety. I'm hoping my psychiatrist, since they handle mental issues, will be able to inform them on the importance of a sleep study. Hoping to finally get some answers.
NotSignal	I actually felt tired around 11:30 tonight. I made sure not to do anything that would wake me up too much. I crawled into bed, turned on my sleep music soundtrack... and I’m still awake. It’s now 1:15am, I expect to be awake for another few hours at least..
Signal	I've noticed this every single time I eat Chipotle late in the day. And it's specifically Chipotle. If I have a burrito for dinner, I will not sleep until at least 4am, or in last night's case, 6:30am. I do take medication for sleep, and I guess my theory is that my digestive system us working overtime trying to digest this massive amount of carbohydrates and is what keeps me awake. Is this possible or am I delusional? Haha.
Signal	Exactly what the title says. I've tried melatonin and I've tried trazadone . Nothing works. I always wake up at least 5 times. Almost once an hour I wake up and have to fall back to sleep. Is this insomnia? Should I see a doctor?
NotSignal	I’m bored. Lol. Anyone wanna talk about the meaning of life
NotSignal	I have a 11:00am class and it’s really difficult for me to wake up at 9:45 to get ready for it. A lot of times in other situations, friends will judge me or assume I’m lazy for always wanting to “sleep in”. Like ok bitch I can’t fall asleep until 3 or 4 am. So waking up 4 hours later sounds miserable.People take for granted how easy life is when you can fall asleep at a normal time and wake up early the following day to be functional and productive
NotSignal	Seriously, 3 hours of sleep is 3 hours of sleep whether you have kids or not. If someone implies that I'll be getting less than that when I become a parent, I want to slap them. I'm tired and I'm allowed to be tired, you self righteous person. But I'm glad you can be proud of those times when your infant had colic and you still went to work while you were miserable. 🙄
NotSignal	Just ventingI was lucky enough to fall in love with and move in with my dreamgirl and now the relationship is being seriously deteriorated by my inability to do activities and the fact that 80 percent of the conversations are about how much I slept or will sleep.This illness is truly horrible
Signal	Hello, I am 15M. I have been struggling with insomnia for a couple of years, my brother recommended hemp oil so I tried it and it works, it's written on the back of the oil bottle that it contains omega 3, 6 and 9, Someone knows what is the relation between those and sleep (Iam asking so I could find a better solution than hemp oil).Also i take melatonin 5mg an hour befor bedtime together with the oil.
NotSignal	I always thought insomnia was like being really tired, but just not being able to sleep. But what I experience is more like my biological clock is fudged. Not the like pregnancy one, but like when it's 8 and the normal person gets tired cause they're head is like "Darkness = sleep, time to nap." For me. It's been like afternoon and around then is when I'm tired. Like yesterday, I stayed up all night, when to bed at 10:00 in the morning, woke up at 4:30. Laid in bed all day, but not tired at all, ended up sleeping the next morning like I didn't get tired at all throughout the whole night. And I just don't understand. I wanna get my sleep schedule better at least for tomorrow, and the only way I can do that is Nyquil. Luckily I got some today. Like even sometimes, I've stayed up all night, next morning rises, I get tired and I'm exhausted alllllll day, then night hits and I'm prepared to finally sleep, but sometimes suddenly I'm not tired at all and only get tired when morning hits again, like? What is this?????
Signal	I've always had trouble sleeping, my whole life. But these last few weeks have just been horrid.I can't fall asleep, when I do fall asleep I often have extremely vivid and distressing nightmares, and if something wakes me in the night (be it a nightmare, a dog, or just an odd occurence) it can take me hours to fall back asleep.I'm so frustrated. I mostly just need to vent. I feel like all of this would be at least a bit more bearable if I were on the antidepressants I was on last year. Like, damn they destroyed my sex drive, but so does barely having any extra energy beyond the most essential tasks.None of the therapists in town are taking new clients at the moment (we just moved to town) and the only psychiatrist is by referral only. I feel like I'm just stuck in this big old no-sleep-grief-suck.I just. want. to. sleep.
Signal	My insomnia isn’t as bad as many on this sub, but I’ve dealt with it for years and it’s affecting my life a lot. I’ve tried Seroquel and Trazadone but hated how they made me feel and they also didn’t work very well.I tried an ambien and I can fall asleep so fast it’s like a dream. I have a doctors appointment soon and I listed it as a sleep visit. I’m not only there for the script, I just want any help to sleep better but I’ve tried everything and I just can’t get to bed. My problem is I’m 19 so I’m afraid the doctor will just think of me as a young kid trying to get his hands on the goods, but really I just want some sleep. Any advice on how to go about this?
NotSignal	Last night i tried to reset my sleep cycle but it backfired and gave me some very bad migraine. Maybe next time i need to remember that one of my triggers is lack of sleep. 😐
NotSignal	Hey sleep seekers, I have a weird ask. Has anyone here had issues with rapid heart beat, high blood pressure and/or chest pain while taking amitriptyline for chronic insomnia? It's working so well for me that I don't want to switch medications, but my heart rate has been so insane that my Apple Watch barely picks up on it anymore, and my blood pressure (which is normally chronically low) has gone up quite significantly, too. I'm winded just standing up, feel my heart beating out of my chest all day and I'm having mild chest pain as well. This all started about a week and a half into starting amitriptyline (been on it for almost a month now), and I figured I'd try to stick with it as my doctor said it can take up to 6 weeks to work properly. Any advice? I'm sure a lot of you will say I need to stop taking it, but I was wondering if anyone knew of an alternative or advice on medications that work for you after having to stop taking amitriptyline. I also have Lunesta as needed, in case you wanted to know. I'm a college student and it's finals week so this is not helping, lol. Thanks in advance for any help! :)
NotSignal	Approximately a year ago I started suffering from insomnia/sleep anxiety. It was because I had one really bad night of sleep due to a tension headache. It was the first time in my life I was unable to sleep at all and it really scared me. I used to average around 7 hours a night but then from then on I was averaging around 5 hours with the occasional night of 0 - 2 hours of sleep. I found this to be manageable though and as long as I didn’t panic in the evenings I usually could guarantee myself 4 - 5 hours of sleep a night. However, about 2 months ago I was having a really bad tension headache again and also got really bad food poisoning. About 1 night later I started noticing I had some mild ringing in my ears (I was listening to music really loud for years on my head phones so it might be a result of that). I started freaking out about it and learnt it was something called Tinnitus (chronic ringing in the ears). I became so anxious about it I didn’t sleep for 4 nights in a row. My doctor gave me Valium to help me break the cycle but I only use it sometimes when I’m desperate since I know it can be addictive. My tinnitus I only hear sometimes when it’s quiet but it’s very noticeable in the evenings when I’m trying to sleep. I got a hearing test but was told my hearing was in the normal range... so I’m not sure if this was caused by the loud music or if it was caused from stress or maybe I’m only noticing sounds in my ears because of the stress. I’m not averaging around 2 hours of broken sleep a night. I’m anxious at least half the day. I’ve tried things like sleep restriction therapy, using white noise to block out the tinnitus, meditation, supplements, I eat very healthy, no alcohol or caffeine... but it doesn’t seem to help. I saw a therapist recently who has put me on CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) and has suggested I should be taking anti depressants. I’m very scared about this idea because I don’t want to be a slave to medication but at the same time I’m finding life really hard to deal with and I don’t see a lot of hope. I also hear some antidepressants can cause or make tinnitus worse (with the exception of mirtazapine) however I’ve also ready personal accounts of people who say that mirtazapine has made their tinnitus worse or even caused it. Is it worth me trying mirtazapine? I hear it’s great for sleep but I’m worried about my body relying on the sedative affects of the drug and building a tolerance.
Signal	So, I've never considered myself an insomniac; since I was a kid I'd always sleep good enough for school, although I always went to sleep pretty late so I guess I was kinda sleep deprived a lot, but I never had issues falling asleep and staying asleep.Ever since quarantine started, I tried to set myself a goal to get my bedtime before midnight and to get up after sunrise to maximize daytime, let me just say since I started that I'd been having way more problems getting to sleep.Last summer I could hit the gym at 11PM and stay up playing games till 4 am and sleep no problem. Nowadays I do stuff like turn off electronics hours before bed, hide my clock, wake up same time everyday, take supplements (not meds) and tried to stay active throughout the day so that I'd get tired. Even to this day I still have at least one night a week where I sleep 3 hours or less.This problem is very foreign to me and I've spoken with a doc, she suggested me the sleep hygeine tactics, just to get myself tired enough to knock me out, but give it enough days and eventually I go to bed and I suddenly get an adrenaline rush that keeps me up till sunrise, I'm pissed. I've never had to rely on meds or good sleep hygiene to get me to sleep or anything like that, and I don't ever wake up more than once during the night. Even when I'm not stressed I get an anxious rush of sweat and muscle jerks that keep me awake. I'm starting to suspect that my body is fixed on going to sleep at very late hours since that's what I'd essentially been doing my whole life, even though apparently you can reset your schedule. I don't know anymore, I just wanna get this out of the way so that I can focus on life.Any help?
NotSignal	You're laying in bed while worrying/trying to fall asleep. You start reaching that hypnagogic state that comes right before finally slipping into that sweet relief that is unconsciousness. But wait, you realize that you're about to fall asleep! Time for your brain to get so excited... that you immediately wake right back up. Back to square one.
NotSignal	This sucks. I've been able to get over it so many other times. This time, I'm feeling like it's just all slipping away from me. I hate it. I have so much brain fog I can barely focus.
Signal	Hi all!So in the past I have had a few problems sleeping, like I would fall asleep and wake up at a specific time almost every night even though there was no change in my sleep schedule, etc.But a week or so ago, maybe even a few days ago, I just havent been able to fall asleep and stay asleep properly. I find myself up and awake until 3AM-4AM until I just can't anymore. I managed to somehow fall asleep, but I keep waking up, at least 2 and even up to 4 or 5 times in one night. I then "wake up" properly at around 10AM-ish. So, despite getting maybe 7 hours of sleep, it doesnt feel like enough because I just keep waking up through the night.I do have schoolwork and that to do, might a bit stressful but nothing that has affected me before. I turn my phone off when I finish with it so its not like I am itching to get on my phone or whatever. Been a bit stressful with my partner recently, so maybe it could be part of it?I'm just dying to get some proper sleep and I dont know if its because my body is just refusing to or if its an underlying cause provoked by a situation in my life.Any tips or over the counter pharmaceutical products is appreciated.Thanks guys!
Signal	Not to say every night but a good 3-4 days a week I find myself waking up at 4 or 5 am every night. I hate this and I’m so freaking sick of it. This started when I was 16 and I’m now 20. I swear this started when I tried to lucid dream. I read something like “force your body still and don’t move no matter how much u want to swallow your saliva or scratch and you’ll lucid dream” idk how bs it is but the next few days after I saw that your supposed to do that in the middle of the night after you’ve woken up, and not when your going to bed. I started waking up in the middle of the night as a result(not on purpose), didn’t think much of it and it just continued. It gets better and worse but I’m so sick of it. I’ve seen every light reduction, follow a routine and etc technique and they’re all bs. The only thing that worked was mirtrazapine (antidepressant that also helps with sleep). I doubt I’m gonna get my solution here but fuck it it’s worth a shot. Thanks for reading.
NotSignal	my sister wanted to sleep downstairs today so i joined her but switching environments makes my sleep anxiety worse and now it’s 5 and i don’t think i’ll sleep before the sun comes up
NotSignal	Good people of Reddit I bid you fair greetings and I’ve come in search of your personal experiences. Backstory: I work in a safety sensitive job and I work primarily doing the night shift (9pm-5am) or there about and I’ve been doing it for three years now. My sleep routine is entirely flipped meaning I get up for work around 6pm for normal folks but it is 6 am for me and I don’t go to sleep until 11pm (am for daytime folks the next day). On my off days I usually just take a nap on my first day off for about 3-4 hours or whatever I can get because I have a long list of chores to catch up on or family to see. However I usually go to sleep around 2 am that night and sleep until morning/afternoon (normal time). Up until the beginning of January I had been able to sleep 8 hours without any issue of waking up prematurely or if I did I was able to go to sleep almost instantly after closing my eyes. Lately, I’ve been going to sleep and waking up almost like clock work four hours later and unable to go back to sleep. I have been tested for sleep apnea and the tests have come back with mild sleep apnea only when I sleep on my back (which I only did during the test because it was uncomfortable otherwise). I can commonly stay awake anywhere between 18-24 hours with only a 4-5 hour rest before without fatigue. but because of my safety sensitive job I’m paranoid and have always vied for an 8 hour sleep. What methods if any, have you all tried? Falling asleep is not my issue it’s staying asleep. Would melatonin work? Could air quality be affecting my sleep? Or am I just one of those sleepless elite who can function on low amounts of sleep and haven’t realized it until now? My sincerest gratitudes my dudes and dudettes.
NotSignal	During these times, I like to imagine a little sleep button. Maybe on the side of my head, maybe a little bit above the temple.♡ It would be so nice, to have happy dreams - when you want to have happy dreams. Maybe someday. :)♡💤🌌
Signal	I’m 22 and have suffered from insomnia since I was 14. I began taking melatonin-until I was immune- then onto diphenhydramine-until I was taking up to 5 a night and finally became immune- and then doxylamine succinate-until I was taking up to 5 a night and was immune. I tried many times during these years to quit taking anything, resulting in a couple of sleepless weeks of being miserable. I recently decided that this plethora of over the counter kills was probably going to do some damage to me if I upped my dosage, so my gynecologist prescribed me Trazodone for my insomnia. After being on it a week- I genuinely don’t think it’s helping at all. My dr offered to up my dosage if necessary, but I don’t think I like the prescription at all. My insomnia allows me to fall asleep (after a while of tossing and turning). About 3-4 hours later, I’m awake and wired. I don’t wake up for any particular reason, but once I’m up I become extremely anxious and too nervous to fall back asleep. I do have daytime anxiety and depression, but my sleeping problems persist even when I’m feeling okay. I’m trying to figure out what to do. Should I see a psychiatrist? Is that the right person to go to for my issues? What should I expect if I do go? Thankful for this community to make me feel less alone in the ever-going battle of sleep.
NotSignal	I know most of you here get it. But I hate not being able to sleep until I legitimately am going to pass out. Me closing my eyes and resting until I sleep isn’t an option anymore. I literally just have to wait until my eyes refuse to stay open and I hate it and that’s when that happens. I’ve tried a few over the counter things that don’t work. And I really don’t want to go on prescriptions. I’ve tried all meditations, yoga, melatonin. It sucks. I’m writing this at 3:00am and I wake up at 6:00am for work so it seems like it’s just going to be another day running on 0 hours of sleep. I’m. So. Frustrated.
Signal	Hi all,I have tried everything - supplements, pills, mindfulness, hypnosis, lifestyle changes (no caffeine or alcohol, rigorous exercise, strict bedtime & wakeup), etc. The \*only\* thing I hadn't tried yet was sleep restriction, because it sounds so f)@$ing miserable. I started two nights ago. My issue is sleep maintenance (I go to bed at midnight and wake up around 4, unable to go back to sleep), not onset, but the sleep restriction of 5.5 hours per night gave me extreme anxiety around having so little time in bed to possibly sleep, and so I couldn't fall asleep, either. So now, instead of getting 4 hours per night, I'm getting 2. Questions:* How is this better?? Isn't that way worse, and further teaching my brain not to sleep at night? Or is this something I'm supposed to get through? * What's more important in restriction: Your wake up time, or keeping a schedule that approximates your sleep pattern? In other words, should I be sleeping midnight - 5:30 AM, or 2:30-8 AM if my desired wake up time is 8 AM?Any help greatly appreciated. I am losing my goddamn mind. It's been 14 months of this hell.Thank you.
Signal	I took OTC sleep aids for about a year and a half. Never needed them until I started taking them. The less they worked, the more I took. A couple weeks ago they stopped working again. The emergency room gave me ambien. I haven't taken Doxylamine succinate since Wednesday probably around midnight. I've been sleepy poorly with ambien. I have improved my sleep hygiene which has helped on the ambien. Does anyone have experience with cutting off sleeping aids? How many nights of sleeplessness am I in for?
Signal	Hey I was wondering if anyone has been on doxepin for insomnia. If so does the next day drowsiness go away after a while or does it persist?
NotSignal	I literally couldn’t move and this has been the 2nd time in the same month. This 2nd time i woke up on the floor though. The first time i was still on my bed but at the bottom of it. These dreams just get worse and worse and the fact that I’m completely awake and can’t move makes it worse. But i can say I’ve learned to slightly fight and deal with them. The worst I’ve had was when i was 13 and my autistic sister (she at the time was 11) was crying next to me saying I was also crying because someone was hurting me. She woke up the entire house and since than, she always comes to wake me up if i sleep too long#it sucks tho. Anyone else have the same problem?
Signal	I take doxylamine (half the recommended dose knocks me right out) and I am noticing my depression/ideation is worse the day after. I think it's taken me a while to notice the connection because those things are present anyway, but I do observe they seem to be worse on it.Anyone else notice this?
Signal	I'm in the UK and I'm having serious problems not getting sleep. Like right now I'm so bloody exhausted compounded with other shit going on in my life right now, the lack of sleep is literally killing me.I want to get some sleeping pills just so I can get a good 8 -10 hours of sleep.Are there any non prescription recommendations please?
NotSignal	Cross posted Hi everyone. I’m hoping someone can give me some advice, or even just encouragement. Had my gallbladder out almost 2 weeks ago after a lovely trip to the ER the week before. Took the week off of work to recover, Sunday was my first full day with no pain meds. Returned to work on Monday. I am working from home due to COVID but this was the first week of our busy season so taking another week off was not an option. Since Sunday (today is Friday 7/10), I’ve been able to sleep maybe 8 hours total? After a bit of research I found that post-surgery insomnia is quite common, especially if you also have sleep apnea (which I do). As a result I’ve been experiencing auditory hallucinations, heart palpitations, my nerves are shot, and I feel like I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it last? Any advice for getting to sleep? I’m not able to take prescription sleep medicines or melatonin for a variety of reasons but I gotta do something. Apologies for the rambling.Also, any recs for dealing with restless legs and arms that are accompanying this fun would be greatly appreciated
Signal	My sleep schedule is usually I fall asleep around 12-1am, then wake up suddenly at 2-3am, then I can’t fall asleep because I’m nauseous, have a headache, anxiety spike from my anxiety disorders, what have you, and then I manage to fall asleep at around 4-6am usually but can last often until the morning. Other days though I’ll fall asleep and stay asleep until noon. Either way I end up sleeping until 12-2pm. How do I stop this annoying cycle and stay asleep? This has been going on for a few months now. I’ve been suggested I have an REM disturbance, and I can always remember my dreams. Scary or not they still wake me up and I can’t sleep correctly. Right now it is 1:30am and my headache is kicking in and I’m getting vertigo. I always avoid falling asleep from nausea because it’s very uncomfortable being thrown around in your sleep by one’s lack of equilibrium. These only happen when I stay up “too late,” but hence happen almost every night.
Signal	I've been taking trazadone for about a year now but for some reason I'm just now getting very nauseous when I wake up. No, I'm not pregnant. LGBTQ couple so that isn't possible, haha. Anyone else feel like this?! I'm so sick right now
Signal	I know it sounds dumb, but I’ve been struggling SOOO hard these past couple of days with sleep. If and when I can go to sleep, it’s light sleep. But I’m just asking if I’m not the only one who is struggling super hard with this. I can’t even sleep when I’m exhausted. Anybody relate to this?
Signal	A bit of backstory here, a few months ago I took LSD and had found that during the come-down period I couldn't sleep no matter what I did, I stayed in a dimly lit room, sat in my bed for roughly 9-10 hours trying and still couldn't fall asleep. The only solution to this was another drug (Marijuana), which even so I felt like my mind was completely awake the whole night and like I didn't actually fall asleep even though I know my body did.Fast forward to around a week ago--I was actually sleeping relatively normally even though it was taking me 30 minutes or so to fall asleep. I had a night where I went out with a few friends and ended up drinking alcohol and accidentally drank an energy drink at 9 P.M. (my usual sleep cycle being 11 P.M. to 7 A.M. for work), I couldn't fall asleep no matter what I did and I felt like I had flashbacks to this horrible trip which actually started to scare me a bit, probably making this whole ordeal worse. I ended up staying awake the whole night and felt like after 35+ hours of being awake I could still not sleep no matter how hard I tried, it felt like every time I went to fall asleep I'd feel palpitations in my chest which reminded me of the trip. I relied on Melatonin and Benadryl to get me to sleep 7-10 hours that night thinking I'd be magically cured after that. Ever since then I felt like I can't sleep at all correctly, and that I need to be on these pills just to get sleep, although now it seems like they've stopped working correctly as even with them I'm only getting 3-4 hours of sleep and waking up every 30 mins to an hour thereafter when falling back into my sleep mode. Luckily today I was able to go from 9 P.M. to 7 A.M. although I did wake up at 1:00 am to the sound of some gunshots outside my house which forced me awake for a bit, I had to take another Benadryl just to get back to that sleepy feeling instead of being wired all night. I still woke up just about every hour only to fall back asleep roughly 10-20 minutes later. &#x200B;What should I do? This is really starting to scare me and compromise my mental state, I've gotten to the point where I'll do anything not to feel like a zombie the next day, even thinking about going out of my way to buy a really expensive mattress to try and help my sleep, my current one is a bit older and of the spring variety with a bit of a dip in the springs where your back would lie, but who's to say I won't buy it and have the same feelings? I already talked to a doctor (over the phone due to Coronavirus) and researched this extensively in my sleepless nights. I thought I might've had sleep apnea albeit I really don't have any of the signs (even though I have asthma and can wake up with some breathing troubles during the night), the doctor I spoke with told me all the usual things that you'd pretty much read off a website, (i.e. take melatonin as needed, turn off screens, take a hot shower before bed); though my mind, no matter how tired my body is, still always feels like I can shoot awake at any second when trying to fall asleep.I know this pales in comparison to some of your accounts of insomnia on this subreddit, but at this point I think I'm actually starting to get scared when I find I can't sleep, how should I handle this? I don't want to get dependent on these medicines, even though it feels like they're barely working currently (though slightly working still helps even if I feel drowsy and a little absent minded the next day). Could this be a psychological? Should I buy this expensive new memory foam bed? I feel like I'm slowly running out of options and hope when it comes to this. I plan to see another medical professional to try and get a sleep study conducted, but in the meantime I thought I'd come here to see if maybe any of you could help. I really appreciate it in advance!
NotSignal	Since I no longer have work to goto I spend all day and all night on the computer mindless scrolling. I've struggled with insomnia in the past and recently I've relapsed been unable to sleep. Is it possible using computer and TV all day has caused the relapse?
NotSignal	I dont have insomia but i wanted to post on sleep related and its 4:25AM right now and i have so many bites from mosquitoes on my body that i really cant sleep anymore, im hoping once sun goes out that i can able to sleep, but my face, my neck, my legs are all itching and i try to my best not to scratch them out
Signal	What's the worst you've survived in relation to insomnia? Like how many hours have you gone w/o sleep or how exhausted have you been, have you become psychotic and when and how did that happen? Asking because this is a recurring fear of mine where every time it gets really bad (I always sleep really bad, but have bouts of almost complete sleeplessness for days on end before I crash for like 5-6 hours..) I think that: "surely, this time I'll die or end up in hospital etc..". I'm also kinda anxious about all the health problems that can occur as a result of insomnia, fuck this is annoying...
Signal	Does anyone know if zopiclone is an anticholinergic or has anticholinergic properties? My mouth is dry from taking it but I can’t ding anything online saying it’s an anticholinergic. Does anyone else know?
NotSignal	My insomnia is always the worst when I have to wake up early the next day. I try to trick myself into thinking I don’t have anything important in the morning but I can never relax. I try my best not to look at the clock before bed time but I can’t help but check and start subtracting how much time I have left to sleep. I went to bed at 12am, actively started trying to sleep at 2am (usually I can fall asleep around this time), last time I checked the time was 3:30, it’s now 5:10 and I honestly have no idea if I slept for that one hour or not. I have to get up for work at 7. This is so annoying. Any advice on how to get some sleep in before having to wake up early?
NotSignal	Looks like its gonna be a 2 nighters for me , do you guys have a limit ? for then you give up eventually take meds?
Signal	I’ve always had a night here and there when I can’t sleep but now it’s every night. I barely even feel sleepy, even during the day. And when I do fall asleep it’s very restless and I wake up in the middle of the night and early in the morning. I don’t know how I’m functioning at all. I tried melatonin and I had nightmares. I’m not sure if they were related so I stopped and anyway it wasn’t helping (are they related?). I’ve been offered ambien, Xanax, etc but I’m not sure I want to go down that road although my current state isn’t sustainable as it is. Advice please?
Signal	Like many of us on here, I *won't* fall asleep without medication, sometimes being up for days. This started before any kind of medication so it wasn't a tolerance/rebound issue. But that's not really the point.The strange thing is that it is extremely difficult to fall asleep, but once I *am* asleep I can sleep through anything in the morning. Sometimes I'll fall asleep on the couch (because my wife snores a little bit and keeps me from getting to sleep), but she'll come out in the morning and turn the news on regular volume, and I'll sleep right on through it. I'll wake up a little bit here and there but have no problem falling back asleep after I've been asleep for a while. It's very strange. However if I do *want* to wake up (like if I set an alarm) I can do that no problem.Anyone else have it where they are unable to fall asleep well, but also are very good at sleeping through even the most disruptive things in the morning?
Signal	For the last few months no matter how tired I am I can’t sleep until at least 5am and even then it takes me hours, I dread going to bed bc it’s such a shit experience. However, once I’m asleep I don’t wake up at all, in fact I sleep ridiculous hours (sometimes even till 7pm). The only time I can fall asleep at a normal time is by staying up the night before however I know this isn’t sustainable. Is it just a messed up sleep schedule or worth seeing a doctor
Signal	My insomnia started at the beginning of February and it's stronger since we started to be quarantined. I am concerned because I don't seem to have any major side effects. Sometimes, I get nauseous, have a small headache or my eyes are burning because of the lack of sleep, but other than that, nothing like you guys seem to describe it. (oh and bags are growing under my eyes)Since Sunday I am getting between 0-3 hours of sleep every night and I actually feel fine and functional. No tiredness, no memory troubles or coordination problems. In fact, today I walked for almost 6 km. Last night, I think I got between 1h30-2h00 of sleep. I recall having a dream last night, but I definitely slept from 6:30 am to 7:30 am and woke up to my alarm. I could have slept more, but I don't want to mess with my circadian rhythm so I make sure to always get up before 10 am no matter how much sleep I am getting.The only odd thing is that my heart rate as became higher than usual, but I don't feel sick so I don't know if I should be worried?Thanks.
NotSignal	Which god is punishing me?Edit: it's 8 am never mind
Signal	So, last night I went to bed at 11.30 p.m. I'd had some wine and one beer, sure. Not the best thing. But at 12.30 a.m. after, what I assume was a period I spent dozing, I woke up as restless as ever.And so I had to get downstairs and spent more than an hour calming down. Watching some HBO. I had a really nice noodle snack. But the point was - there was no way I was getting to sleep. And so, maybe I've done 3.30 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. last night, diminished to some extent by having alcohol on board (Dr. Walker refers - night caps are not good for sleep).So its a little good, and a little bad, but I still don't know why my brain doesn't work the way others' do.
Signal	This is a shot in the dark. I never post but I feel like I'm alone on this which is making me panic. I used to be able to fall asleep in no time and stay asleep. Until 2 weeks ago. Nothing has changed, I'm not on any medication, no change in diet, my job is in a nice slow season, there is nothing stressful going on that could be the cause. This came on out of the blue. Suddenly one night, I was having trouble falling asleep. I feel like I just lay there for hours in a light sleep and whenever I start drifting to a deeper sleep, my body would jolt awake like I'm being shocked. Then it happened again the next night, then it turned into a week, and now over 2 weeks of experiencing this. I've tried taking melatonin but I feel the only thing it gives me is stomach pains. I still jolt awake. I went to the doctor earlier today for help. I'm waiting to hear back on some bloodwork, but he said he doesn't know why I'm experiencing this... which is beyond frustrating. He prescribed me zolpidem tartrate, which I'm scared to take. It's so silly of me to be this scared, but can anyone tell me more about what he prescribed? Is there anyone who could help me figure out what I'm experiencing? Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
Signal	. 17 years old The fucking trifecta of misery sleep apnea, tinnitus, and severe mouth pain. Idk if it’s just my hppd acting up or if my brain is shutting down but everything be looking hella wavy and shimmering. Sometimes I’ll have up to 10 dreams in a night and wake from each. The only way I get relief is using drugs, I think Im gonna buy Xanax again. I just found a new plug and he has script bars. Tf am supposed to do hw and take tests when I am unable to take a shower and eat food.
Signal	The dph and meletonin combo really helped me i would recommend it and doesn't leave me too groggy in the morning had some herbal tea as well.
NotSignal	My body is breaking down.I had insomnia from chronic pain. Doctors gave me medicines to try to help me sleep. They did not work and gave me mania.Now i cant sleep at all. Please help!
Signal	Almost 5 am. Crippling nausea that now further prevents me to sleep. Been trying to sleep for the past 3 and a half hours, but haven't managed yet. I have had this happen to me very rarely before, and generally I fell asleep after a while, but this time around I'm genuinely stuck. Birds chirping and cars are passing by. I find it somewhat hilarious, it's probably how anxiety is manifesting itself.As listed as the start I am feeling nauseated, which is a feeling I absolutely dread since I'm also scared shitless of vomiting and stuff, but the real reason I haven't slept yet is the fact that I have random thoughts about tv series, things I did during the day, people I talked to during the day. It's weird, they are insignificant thoughts that prevent me from sleeping.But i feel..... Fine. Other than the nausea and tiredness I don't have much going on: I could probably stand up and go for a walk if I wanted to. I hope this is just a thing that happened today and never happens again. As I'm writing this my nausea is getting stronger and my heart is starting to pound even more for the fear of throwing up. How do you all go through this everyday? It's the first time in my life I genuinely feel sorry and sad for somebody's else condition.
NotSignal	I never had such problems with sleeping ever, and reading some stories of people scare the shit out of me, I didn't have good sleep in 3 weeks now and I don't know what to do anymore..
NotSignal	All night I can't lay still, I try to just get comfortable but I can't. My legs want to do something. It's been 3 days with this and I ended my nofap streak tonight just trying to pass out. Wtf do I do? Does this feeling subside?
Signal	My issues are entirely based in falling asleep for the first time and not staying asleep. Have been dealing with this for over a decade and the older I got, the harder it was to go on 2-3 hours of sleep a night for work.I had tried every OTC and suggestion I could find. Eventually said screw it and went to a doctor. I had done my research and was pretty sure that zaleplon was what I needed since it only lasts like two hours but the doctor suggested I tried trazadone first. It didn't work and only made me groggy the next day. Eventually after a drug test I was prescribed 30 zaleplons (short acting ambiens as I like to refer to them). I only take them 2-4 nights a week and when I do I'm out pretty much as soon as they kick in.Not spending hours a night trying to fall asleep has improved my overall sleep time/quality even on nights I don't take it. It's almost as if being able to fall asleep whenever I want has helped my brain (which is usually running at 100 mph in bed) shut itself off when in bed even without the drug. It has only been a month but i've had zero negative side effects but one funny story. My gf was over watching anime trying to fall asleep after I went to bed soon after taking it. She accidentally woke me up, I looked over and said "why the fuck did you wake me up, Sasha?" then instantly fell back asleep. I don't remember any of it but it makes for a funny story. Anyways, I figured I'd share my story in case it helps anyone. I was pretty anti prescription sleeping aid until recently but I'm pretty happy about it since it's not an every night thing for me.
NotSignal	yeah im nervous asf rn and cant sleep😭what are some things you like to tell yourself to calm down?i like to think my bed is just a place to rest and not to sleep but i get too impatient sometimeshelp pls
NotSignal	If i know myself and assume others have the same problem then having too much unnecessary thoughts is the reason for sleepless nights. Is not caring about anything the only possible solution? I remember have good sleeping habit for 3 months because of it and now because of corona lock-down that habit is lost.
Signal	Hi all,I just got a rx for 5mg ambien. I’m scared of developing a dependency. I recently stopped taking another medication and the withdrawal effects made me super depressed and anxious. I’m thinking about taking ambien during the week and klonopin on the weekends. That way I don’t develop a strong tolerance to either medication. Thoughts?
Signal	i think i'll finally explain my sporadic fatal insomnia worries. the worries keep coming and going.i heard about sfi AND ffi almost two years ago. they bothered me for a bit, but..not that much. fast forwards two years later. scare theater uploads a video about a man who suffered from some sort of fatal insomnia and died. someone then commented about sfi, the sporadic version. it made me a little anxious, but not too much, and i went to sleep. i don't remember how long i slept. i had a vivid-ish dream. i tend to have vivid dreams a lot, though.tuesday night, i go to bed. i feel a bit anxious from some intrusive thoughts. i slept for 5ish hours. (typical for me, since i have regular insomnia.)wednesday night, i then start to freak out about sfi. i will also say that i get hypnic jerks quite often, but they got worse. i started to cry. "could i have this disease? oh my god, i bet i have it. i'm going to die."thursday night, i sleep. 5-7 hours, maybe? i recall 3 vivid dreams. i still freak out over sfi friday morning and cry. this morning, i went to bed at 5am because my friend and i were on the phone. i woke up at around 10am. i recall some dreams.what's weird to me is that i can remember some dreams by seeing some objects....idk if this has happened to me before. according to some, sfi starts with dementia and ataxia, neither of which i have. some others, however, say differently. i have insomnia, sleep jerks, and vivid dreams as of now...everyone is telling me it's my hypochondria and that i'm fine...i dunno what to believe. hell, even my grandmother is annoyed. i've been taking short term memory tests to test myself. and i have always twitched throughout the day, but it has now gotten worse. i don't remember twitching when i lost my friend to suicide. i'm pacing back and forth as i write this. is this anxiety, or could it be something like sporadic fatal insomnia? i really, really don't want to die...i really don't. i'm so scared....i am also an 18 year old pre-everything trans boy.
Signal	It’s 03.16am. I’ve been in bed since 22.00. My son keeps rolling over from his side of the bed and forcing me to lie almost off the edge of the bed. I’ve killed 6 mosquitos already, but there’s definitely at least one more buzzing around our heads. Today was a really emotionally taxing day, between my son refusing to go to bed, arguing with my SO, and just general stress of being a single mom. I have a big sports fixture tomorrow evening and all I can think about now is how the lack of sleep tonight is going to affect me tomorrow. So frustrating!!! Just need to vent!
NotSignal	Ive tried everything can’t sleep can it be my thyroid imbalance I go on 2/3 days awake with 2./3 hours . Tried magnesium citrate helped for about a hr then can’t sleep again. Have also heart burn like crazy
NotSignal	idk what to do, I have to admit that I am a bit anxious since the last 2 times I took an Ativan, it knocked me out for 9 & 4 hours. Also never been through 2 sleepless nights in a row idk what’s it going to be like tomorrow? (Can someone tell me how’s it going to be) I’m a bit stressed about my memory...
Signal	was going to wait till tomorrow (or later today) to post this because i figured no one would be up right now, then i remembered which sub i was posting to...anyway, i have no trouble taking naps at any point of the day. i’ll even take them in the evening sometimes. but i absolutely cannot fall asleep at night no matter how exhausted i am wtf is up with that!!
Signal	I have always found it difficult to sleep, stay asleep, and am a light sleep at best with may 2-4hrs. And good for next 30.. So now i take ambeim (10mg)with sides of Benadryl, and melation.. Currently out of last 2 atm btw.My ambein has npt put me to sleep. And it seems every is high as ever.. I did lower sugar and liquids intake several hours before. Can i take another ambein? Got doctors appt tomorrow. Currently on take home chemotherapy.
NotSignal	Cognitive decline/brain fog is real when you have insomnia. I just tried to help my dad with Linux. I was explaining to him what the "sudo apt-get update" command does and I said It updates the Linux operating system. He called me out because he said it only updates the packages, not the whole thing. I fucking know this. I know this in my head but it's not what I said. The words just wouldn't come to mind to I gave a stupid explanation to make him understand I knew what I was doing.Once he called me out, I felt like a fucking idiot.This happens other times too. Sometimes I'll be in a conversation and I will forget words and whole concepts. So much so that when I try to speak, nothing comes out making any sense.My father now thinks I'm a retard. He already see's me as a failure because he deems me as "lazy" instead of a struggling sleeper. Kill me now.
NotSignal	hullo, i'm not sure how insomnia works, do any of y'all that do have insomnia have any insight? are there like different ways insomnia works? sorry, i have a lot of questions lol but my friend seems to go through a cycle of staying up for days then falls asleep for a whole day, what are some ways i can try to help them work on their sleeping habits?
Signal	Some of you may not consider this insomnia since I do sleep a small amount every night, but it’s only about three to four hours. I guess it’s called Maintenance Insomnia? I will fall asleep anytime between 11:30pm and 12:30am, sleep for about three (often) to four (rare) hours, wake up feeling alert like it’s 8:00am, and then be completely unable to go back to sleep. After a few hours I’ll feel absolutely exhausted, and I might be able to take a 45 minute nap somewhere in the day, but even that is cut short in the same manner. This is completely unlike me compared to previous years. I’ve always been a heavy sleeper that needed three alarm clocks *and* a person to wake me up, and I’ve never had a problem willing myself to sleep for 10 hours or more if I was feeling lazy. I started having problems when I started Lexapro in December of 2019 for panic attacks (which I no longer have for the most part). I would have horrible nightmares every single night, and I would toss and turn all night unable to sleep for more than two consecutive hours, but still able to sleep for a cumulative 10. I stopped taking the Lexapro back in late March due to these sleeping problems and the suspicion that it was making my panic worse (I was right). My sleep mostly returned to its normal state by late April. I was sleeping most of the way through the night without tossing and turning, and I stopped having nightmares. I slept “normally” for about three weeks, then started experience Maintenance Insomnia around May 20th. It may be worth noting that I quit my birth control back in late January of this year, and with every month that passes, my anxiety and panic gets better and better seemingly in direct correlation to quitting the BC. But now I’m wondering... as my anxiety and panic get better... why is my sleep now getting worse? Hormonal imbalance? I am speaking to my doctor and a naturopath about these issues, but no one seems to have an answer. Waiting back on some hormone testing. Does anyone have any experience with either of these things (Lex or BC)? Or maybe just with Sleep Maintenance Insomnia in general? Please help :(
Signal	It sounds horrible to me, but I've always had insomnia and even if I'm awake the entire night apparently it could be useful. Probably expensive though.I think I might have Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. It would explain a lot. I'm so tired of being tired and having chronic insomnia though. I can't remember a time where it wasn't like this.Any thoughts?
NotSignal	School started and weirdly I fell asleep easily last night? I sleep fine on school nights but on breaks I suddenly get insomnia... shouldn’t it be the other way around??? Lmao
Signal	just a rant.my insomnia has just been getting worse and worse by each week. It has consecutively gotten worse and continues to rapidly get worse. I used to be able to at-least pass out during the day for a few hours (never did much but it was something) but now, I only get an hour or 2 of sleep each day. I’ve tried pretty much every over the counter pills and even a prescribed pill for sleep- but my body utterly just rejects them all and never works. it’s getting to the point where i’m constantly just breaking down because i’m just so tired, and nobody is taking it seriously at all, no matter how many times i try and explain it. My father doesn’t believe in any “mental health issues” and pretends they don’t exists; meaning that both of my parents consistently blame it on my cellphone when i don’t even have it with me when i go to sleep. i’ve tried everything the doctor told me, and none of it worked. I am on vyvanse, but even when i went almost 2-3 weeks without it i still had such terrible insomnia. I’ve even started having auditory hallucinations, but when i tell them they don’t listen at all. i honestly just don’t know what to do anymore and everyone always self diagnosis themselves so whenever i try to ask someone for help or try to tell someone they just say “everyone has it” or “oh yeah i pulled an all-nighter the other night too” when it’s completely different from that. I hope that doesn’t sound rude or whatever but it just gets upsetting sometimes.
NotSignal	Oh sleep! It is a gentle thing, Beloved from pole to pole! To Mary Queen the praise be given!She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven, That slid into my soul.-Samuel Taylor Coleridge
Signal	For the past two weeks, I haven’t been able to sleep properly. I can only manage to get around 3-4 hours of sleep a night, and sometimes no sleep at all. I was able to get a full night’s rest for a few days about a week ago, but then the problem came back and worsened. It’s weird though, because it doesn’t feel like “regular” insomnia where I just lie awake for hours on end. Instead, I constantly drift between this odd state of being awake and being asleep. It’s like my body is tired, but my mind is just a sludge of dreamlike thoughts. Though my body is still and relaxed, my brain will continue to think about all sorts of weird things, as if I’m dreaming, only I’ll be vaguely aware of the fact that I’m awake. Sort of as if my thoughts are spinning out of control while I feel barely conscious, yet I am able to recognize that I AM still conscious. Time passes by really quickly in this state, and I feel so exhausted that I don’t want to move or get up. Additionally, my heartbeat feels really loud and slow (or maybe fast? I can’t really tell) when I’m in this state. Whether or not I take melatonin or other sleeping aids, this sensation persists. I’ve also tried meditation (though not very well or for very long) and breathing exercises, but these don’t do anything to alleviate this either. I’ve experienced this before, namely one time that I got sick and could barely sleep for the next few days due to this bizarre sensation. I remember being filled with this paralyzing fear back then that is only associated with insomnia, and I really feel like that now as well. I’m so irritable all the time, and nighttime is filled with so much anxiety, paranoia, and reluctance to go to bed. Every time I experience a rough bout of insomnia (though this has got to be the worst case yet), it’s as if I unlock this secret world of a very chilling, very insomnia-specific kind of fear. That’s part of why this COVID-19 shit scares me, because if I become unable to leave my house, I’ll just be suffering alone with my family members who always brush off my problems regarding insomnia. It also means that I won’t get the chance to wear myself out by going outside or attending class. Has anyone else experienced this similar “stuck in between” feeling? If so, do you have any solutions for overcoming/improving it? Or to help insomnia in general? I apologize for any mistakes or if something doesn’t quite make sense. I am, very obviously, pretty sleep deprived at the moment.
NotSignal	Guys I don’t know what to do, I’ve had this for 2 months and I feel so helpless. I’m not able to function because this eats up my whole day, can’t work and it’s ruining my relationship and had to move home. I keep reading the key is just to accept it, but how? How do I accept it? How do I let it not consume me? I feel like I’m on the edge I don’t know what to do.
NotSignal	I have a YouTube channel dedicated to helping people relax and sleep, and I shared a link here but I think it got deleted. Yes, I’m advertising my channel, but my channel has helped thousands of people with insomnia sleep, when nothing else works. Why can I not introduce people here to it??
Signal	Hey guys, new to reddit, joined just to make this post (I'm not really on any other social media anymore and I wanted some help out here).So the last month I've been having insomnia worse than I've ever had. Prior to now I had sleep anxiety and on and off struggles falling/staying asleep. Once many years ago I had a month or two where I had issues with sleep paralysis after a severe traumatic event in my life, and eventually it passed. But this is the first time I haven't been able to fall asleep at all.Starting about four weeks ago, I have random bouts where I lay awake in bed for hours growing increasingly stressed that I can't fall asleep. Three of those times I was able to fall back asleep after 7am and sleep a few hours before waking up again around 11am, but this is the first time I've made the decision to just give up trying to sleep at all.What's really driving me crazy is that I think I know why this is happening, but I can't do anything to convince my mind and my body that it's okay to fall asleep. The insomnia started the same week I had firmly decided I was going to start seeing a therapist. The second incident happened the night after my first meeting with her, and the third incident was the night before my second meeting with her. But since that second meeting, I've been barely sleeping at all this week. And when I do, I'm prone to nightmares. I really like this therapist and feel like in two sessions shes helped me more than my former therapist did in two years, but honestly that's probably part of why I'm struggling. Now I have to face all this stuff.So I can imagine why seeing a therapist would cause me anxiety; I've had a difficult last few years (I had to move cities in my state multiple times, I lost three very beloved family pets in the space of one year, I realized my dream job wasn't actually what I wanted, and I was forced to drop out of college for the fourth or fifth time even before covid started just to name a few), on top of that I've recently realize that my issues with anxiety stem directly from childhood emotional abuse trauma that I didn't realize was abuse. This is all heavy stuff that I haven't been really looking forward to unloading with a therapist. So I can completely understand why I'd be emotionally and physically wrung out, and that that could cause a lot of reasons for me not to sleep. The issue being that I know exactly why I'm stressed and I can't do anything to sleep any better.I dont usually talk about stuff like this online and I feel kind of uncomfortable posting this, but I've been feeling very alone in all of this. So I guess here's what I wanted to ask: Has anyone else been through something similar (specifically, dealing with trauma and/or starting therapy and having insomnia as a result)? If so, did it eventually end? How long did it go on?Also, does anyone have any tips for managing the added anxiety that comes from not sleeping?Thank you to anyone who read this far. I wish you better luck tonight sleeping than I had.
NotSignal	Around 2-3am every day when I’m doing whatever, I occasionally yawn randomly for no reason, but when I get into bed my mind is switched on and racing and it’s impossible to shut it off for the next hour until the same thing happens. Any tips on how to fall asleep quicker instead of lying awake?
Signal	I'm honestly not trying to take advantage of the system, I can barely function with a job because I get anxious about waking up at a certain time everyday. I have a job but I haven't slept in 4 days now and I barely sleep ever, I cannot take it anymore. I would rather be poor with the ability to sleep than to continue like this.
NotSignal	Leave it to me to not be able to get enough sleep for a 4pm appointment. It's currently 9:30 am and my mind has been racing too much to sleep. I've been laying here bored out of my mind for 7 hours.
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for over ten years and have tried so many things. I’ve tried hydroxyzine, Benadryl, trazodone, weed, melatonin, deep breathing, aromatherapy, magnesium, exercise. And I still can’t sleep.I have chronic pain that keeps me up with no real treatment options besides surgery or opioids. I want to sleep without addictive medication but I don’t know what else to do.Any suggestions of drugs I should ask to try? Or how to talk to the doctor? I’m nervous about being dismissed. Or coming off as drug seeking. I just need a little help.
NotSignal	I can be utterly exhausted and finally get on the brink of sleep, but can’t completely fall asleep. It’s really annoying me now cuz I’m only 17 and probably shouldn’t be worrying about my sleep but I do.
Signal	This is normal life for me.I'm so tired of this, literally so tired. It has been going on for years and I can't handle it anymore. For a couple months medication seemed to help but now it's wearing off. I'm about this close to ending it, guys.
Signal	I’m 20. All throughout high school sleeping was always a problem but I wanna say a couple months ago it became even worst. For example, yesterday I worked 11:30-9, I got home tired as shit. So I KO’d like 11, and 4 am I’m up. This happens like everyday. I can’t stay asleep. The worst part is like my body will be tired but my mind will be awake so I just be turning and turning trying to fall back asleep which ultimately always fails. Before I couldn’t fall asleep at all so I’d just be up playin the game. I knew it was bad but it was like whatever but this shit sucks bro. It makes you so uneasy. I try going to a different bed, tried the couch, I was so frustrated I wanted to try my fucking car bro. I didn’t but I legit don’t know what to do. Can I do anything at home about this or I have to speak to someone about that?
NotSignal	I can't sleep. Since quarantine my sleep schedule has gone to shit I usually go to sleep at 4-6am and wake up at 2-3pm sometimes I don't get sleep at all. Any advice?
Signal	So I became very ill Sunday and it might be CHS cannabis related now this was my go to sleep aide for years and ya since I’ve been throwing up non stop horrible stomach pains and hour spread out idk how feeling fine I’m supposed to get sleep let alone this shit....
NotSignal	Hi,I have this problem where I can fall asleep at like 11PM/12AM but find myself awake at 3-4AM every morning. I don’t know what’s caused this, just that it’s been going on for about a year on and off. It’s really messing with my day because I’ll either stay awake from 4-8AM then sleep till noon, or stay awake from 4AM then get really tired earlier on in the day - say like 2PM ish. I’m a student in a very busy course so need as many waking hours as possible. I was thinking it might be sleep apnea related, as I’ve woken up in the past feeling like i can’t breathe, but I can’t be sure. I’ve also woken up with headaches but have assumed it’s due to dehydration. Does anyone have a similar issue? How do you deal with it? Also, for those who know, what is the testing for sleep apnea like?
Signal	I (36f) was diagnosed with POTS, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and one of the symptoms is adrenaline dumping, particularly at night and while sleeping. They started me on 50mg of visatril (hydroxyzine) before bed, but it still hasn’t helped staying asleep. Falling asleep is fine, I’m usually asleep by 10pm, around 1am I have an adrenaline dump and then I’m awake until 3-4am, and have to wake for work at 6am. It’s a long shot, but anyone else dealing with diagnosed adrenaline issues?? Or anyone used vistaril for sleep?
Signal	I swear to god himself I am literally the antichrist for sleep meds. I've tried so many and nothing works. My doctor is baffled by my tolerance. He sarcastically gave me the 12.5 mg ambien the highest dose there is... he was dumbfounded when I came in and said "well, I took one and nothing, took another and.. nothing. What now.. doc?" Sonata.. joke. Restoril.. joke.Lunesta.. joke.Belsomra.. joke. Nothing works! Anyone have this issue? And what medication actually worked and at what dose? I also suffer from major depressive disorder so I do take 300mg of wellbutrin doesnt really give me energy but my doctor likes to blame that on the sleep meds not working. But I was like this long before the wellbutrin.
Signal	Hello,Does anyone else ever experience this:I can go to sleep within half an hour but I always wake up at the 5/6 hour mark with thoughts in my head. As if I was dreaming and then woke upSome days cant go back to sleepBut other times I can go back but then it's super light sleep and I end up waking up again an hour later.If you do experience this how do you stop it lol. I cant control my thoughts when I'm alseep/dreaming so I dont know how to stop myself from waking up. And even when I fall back sleep I wake up in an hour for some reason
NotSignal	There's two things in the world that is important: sleep and water. I've been drinking lots of water lately that headaches are like dust. \[DAY 1\] I don't have any sleeping pills so I cant sleep at all warm milk doesn't help it's 12:00 am before insomnia came into my life I went to bed at 12am. \[DAY 2\] I registered on reddit to get help, no one NO ONE AT ALL!!!! \[DAY 3} nothing... \[DAY 4\] \[DAY 4\] \[DAY 4} \[DAY 4} \[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}\[DAY 4}
Signal	Can't sleep...got an exam Tomorrow...I was tired after and slept and woke up 11pm :|...any suggestions?
NotSignal	It’s half past seven in the morning and I have still not slept. My insomnia goes in phases over time but it’s the worst it’s been for a long time tonight/today. I’ve tried every possible remedy that usually works for me to help me sleep and nothing is working. My brain is so wired and just jabbering on about random nonsense in my head and won’t shut off. Got so late that I’m now wondering if it’s worth trying to power through the day and hopefully sleep better tonight but I also know if I try that I’ll crash properly around 3pm then nap for 3-4 hours until someone wakes me up for food. Ugh.sorry for the rant, thanks for listening!
NotSignal	My therapist said it could potentially be helpful even if I'm awake the whole time since it would give a better idea of how my brain functions at night.
NotSignal	I fucking hate dealing with this shit. I have so much stuff to do tomorrow. So many deadlines to meet. I just feel miserable. Not that I want a pity party (I don’t.) i just wanted to let it out for a minute. My roommates always make fun of me for being up so late and I used to laugh but now I just want to cry. And even writing this post makes me feel bad because I constantly think about how much more fun original I could be if I could just. Close. My eyes. I hate that I’m writing this. There is so much bad shit in the world, and so many of you that have it worse than me, by here I go again feeling sorry for myself at 2 am.
NotSignal	For about a year now since the traumatic experience after a bad trip on weed, my sleep has never been the same. It's seems like even if it's 6-8 hours I wake up not as refreshed as I used to, and finally several months back, I was starting to get good sleep again till I fell back and relapsed into another bout, then after that one passed, yet another bout, and now I am back to square one. This morning I woke up with some very dry eyes, infact they were so dry that when I closed my right eye shut to try and bring moisture to it, it got stuck for several seconds and I couldn't move it. I do have allergies such as phlegm and stuffy nose, and usually I wake up with eye bugers. Last night I slept as least 6 hours but was waking up a lot. Anyway, not sure if I have dry eye syndrome or if this is just me suffering from quality of sleep.
Signal	I've been having pretty bad sleeping issues since September last year. I can't for the life of me fall asleep before 1am, I am studying and working at the same time as an intern which means I have to wake up on Mondays and Tuesdays at 4:30am to catch the bus at 5am and start working from 6-2pm, then get home and study for exams and the rest of the week I gotta be up at 5:30am because my lessons start at 7:05. It's killing me, I'm so stressed and people think I am making up excuses and telling me to eat this and that and all that bullshit. I've tried everything but nothing works. Pulled an all nighter a couple of weeks ago and fell asleep at 10pm, woke up at 5:30, came home after lessons feeling like shit and falling asleep because I couldn't even think without falling asleep and we're back at the same shit again. I can't talk about it with anyone, coworkers are treating me like shit which makes it all worse, my doctor did fuck all about it even though I mentioned it several times.. I just don't know what to do anymore, every day feels like torture. It's 2am as I'm writing this and I have to be up in a bit more than 2h..
Signal	Has anyone else become SIGNIFICANTLY worse about sleep since quarantined hit?I’m usually up until 2:00-3:00am on a normal night but with having nothing to get up for I haven’t been forcing myself to try to sleep like I normally would.It’s 6am and I’m still up and panic mode has set in even though I have no reason to get to sleep/get up in the morning.Anyone else in this kind of spot?
Signal	Help: My head spinning but I cannot sleep!I’m very exhausted doing hw late at night because i was having a mental breakdown and deep heated conversation with my sister...Anyone up for a convo or giving me tips to fall asleep because i have classes!?I cant with insomnia
Signal	The last time I slept was for about 4 hours on Sunday, late morning to early afternoon. I feel tired, but I can’t sleep. I don’t know what to do. I’m at my wit’s end. I have tried everything... prescription and OTC drugs and supplements, hypnosis, meditation, sleep stories... I feel fairly alert. I had a job interview today, and I think it went fairly well. I also visited with family (I haven’t seen any family since Christmas, because of Covid, so that was really nice). I also drove for four hours today with no problems. This afternoon while reading, I started to feel very sleepy, so I put my book away, laid down and closed my eyes, and immediately felt wide awake. I thought perhaps I was just sleeping a little bit and somehow not noticing, but my Apple Watch confirms that I haven’t slept since early afternoon Sunday, and I’m not like missing any time; I can account for every hour of the day. I am extremely worried about this. I generally sleep more than the average person. Like, typically, I sleep 9-10 hours per day, and occasionally even get another hour nap in. I haven’t taken any stimulants, the only caffeine I’ve had this week was two cups of coffee (one on Monday and one before my job interview today) and a couple of diet sodas. I feel completely fine, just VERY tired. However, when I looked it up online it said that you can start to hallucinate after three days. I do NOT want to hallucinate; I once had a piece of bone marrow from a broken leg like somehow go to my brain like a decade ago, and for five or six days, I experienced hallucinations, and it was the most terrifying thing that I’ve ever experienced. Does anyone have any suggestions? I am absolutely desperate to sleep, but even though my eyes feel tired, and my body feels worn out, I feel completely alert and not actually sleepy. I don’t have any sort of manic disorder or bipolar disorder or anything. I’ve slept only four hours of the last 120, and I am extremely concerned. No other symptoms; I genuinely feel okay. Calm, not sick... I’ve just been reading and doing crosswords, hoping I would get sleepy. What could be causing this? What can I do?? Thank you!
Signal	So i’ve had an issue since age ten or so where no matter what I could possibly do, if i’m not on a very strict schedule my sleep schedule naturally flips and i’m up all night and sleep during the day. Even with the schedule i’d sleep very late and could never wake up on time. Along with that I was a child that never took naps, genuinely was never tired. Another childhood tidbit is that I recently realized that even at 2-3 years old i’d comfortably be awake until 3am and that most children just can’t stay up that long. I wasn’t screaming or anything, just chillin quietly watching tv while everyone slept. The thing is that unlike other people’s stories I feel completely fine when I do finally wake up. I’m not exhausted or anything I just don’t have the same schedule other people do and when i’m sleep deprived it’s because i’m forcing my body to work with the schedule I need to be on for societal standards. Honestly my main complaint is boredom. I’m so bored and lonely at times because my active hours are when everyone is asleep. I quietly make dinner while everyone wakes up and brush my teeth at the same time as everyone else before going to bed. I genuinely do not feel tired until I see the sun come up. I don’t really know what to do because I know I have to be on a schedule when I graduate college and i’ve had multiple jobs but one job and nothing else to focus on is not enough to keep me awake during the day. Personally the issue with melatonin is that I will end up sleeping for 14 hours straight and nothing will possibly wake me up so i’m kind of stuck here. I also have issues with chronic pain and can’t take nyquil because I already take way more ibuprofen than the average person and I definitely know what irritated organs feel like, trust me. At this point I don’t know if i’m looking for advice or if I just want to feel normal but anything and everything would help. TLDR: I have been naturally nocturnal almost my entire life and the boredom and loneliness is more annoying than being tired and cranky when I feel the wrath of the sun.
Signal	i usually dont have sleep problems but i just cant sleep these days. i usually fall asleep around 5am after 3 hrs of trying but this one just takes the cake. my head is already pounding and god already knows how im going to get through the entire day.
NotSignal	I usually get around 5 hours of sleep when i'm lucky, and what i do to fall asleep is drawing little squares (or other shapes) with my finger on my pillow, near my ear, so I can hear it better (you know how sounds are amplified if you have your ear on the same surface). I try to use the same rhythm for all the little squares or triangles that i trace and as I focus to keep it constant, i begin to slowly fall asleep. It keeps my attention away from obsessing over how many minutes of sleep i have left and i only focus on those little movements, instead of other things. I think some of you may already know this trick, some of you may not, but it's one of the only things that have worked for me. It doesn't always work, of course, sometimes i'm just too stressed and i can't even breathe, but on nights when i could be falling asleep if only i could think of sth else, this trick is pretty useful.
Signal	I definitely have insomnia and I definitely need help. But I've never in my life tried to seek therapy in any kind and I don't know, it's just like I can't reach out.... I've never told ny of my friends about my insomnia and i just don't seeing myself telling these very private things to a complete stranger.
NotSignal	I trick my brain into believing that it will not sleep especially when tired... So for example, I’ll tell myself “You probably won’t get any rest tonight. You’ll be awake for hours with your eyes closed.” Which is still somewhat good for you so just do that which is the next best thing if you absolutely cannot sleep. It’s sort of like creating a movie or TV show in your mind, and I just do that to keep myself occupied as morning approaches. BAM! I’m asleep and for a good 6-7 hours which is amazing for me. The mindset is important, because otherwise it wouldn’t be that effective or work much at all.I go into it with pessimism, because that calms down my massive anxiety.
NotSignal	Does anyone else get anxious when you see those first rays of light cracking through and you haven't slept a wink yet? This is one of the only things that gives me anxiety.
Signal	I’m 20 m, I get these waves of bad sleep, last this week it’s been going to bed 12am falling asleep At 1:30am waking up at 4am not sleeping till 6:40am waking up at 10am I honestly don’t think I can do this anymore I always feel tired and physically and mentally sick, my vision is constantly blurred, I have a massive headache, also it’s impacting my type 1 diabetics so bad, I’m feeling like I wanna kill myself but I can’t function and constantly feeling like shit, id be better if dead I think, I hope everyone can sort of their sleep problems and I have you guys have a happy and joyful life!

Signal	Always Had trouble sleeping, buy zopis online always from the real pharmacies that you needed a script from private gp. 14 tabs for like 50 quid. Sleep means that much to me. There's gotta be uk generics out there like zimovane etc rather than these blue Hab pharma ones. Anyone find they have to double them up? 🙄
Signal	I've lived with insomnia for as long as I can remember. It was one of the reasons I started drinking and using - of course, you can guess how that turned out. I'm now 4 years' clean and sober, and the insomnia rages on. I've tried all the sleep-hygiene things, I've tried herbal and OTC remedies. I am bone-tired come bedtime, but my brain never seems to rest. I'm so used to it now - going a night or more every week with not a single wink. Sleeping maybe four hours all the others - or on a "good" night (when my body is finally shutting down from fatigue), I may get up to six, albeit fitfully.Doctors have tried, giving me hydroxyzine or a psych med. Nothing has helped, and the Rx stuff makes me feel worse than I do when I'm only sleep-deprived. Docs basically tell me that anything that would do the trick for me (like Ambien) is off-limits given my past substance abuse.My question is, is there a prescription-strength sleep aid (i.e., something made to help people sleep, not something whose side effect is "drowsiness") out there that isn't habit-forming? Any recovering addicts here who have found something that actually works - but that doesn't lead you to a dope house three days later? I've had 30 years of shitty sleep, and I can't f\*\*\*ing take it anymore. This past week was especially bad - three hours most nights, none at all on two - I was up to my ears in work and personal business, and I am now so exhausted I've been craving cocaine, which is super rare for me at this stage in my sobriety. Help.
NotSignal	I slept for 4 hours last night and I tried to lay down and I have severe palpitations. I give up. Bed felt good but I ant lay there listening to my heart beating in my chest.
NotSignal	Since 2019 July I can't fall asleep until 5 AM or later. My mom and dad blame it on technology, so sometimes they take my phone at nights and don't give it back until morning; and since during the nights I've got nothing else to distract me I force myself to sleep around 11 PM but I wake up at 2 AM and stay awake until like 9 AM. But this only happens when I go to bed early, because whenever I sleep late I can spend up to 12 hours of sleep with no interruption. Why does that happen? Do you have any advice?
Signal	I don't currently take anything for depression. I did when I was diagnosed with post-partum. I also used to take Zopiclone, but that really fucked me up and it wasn't a good idea as a single mom. Also took Seroquel, did well with that but slowly got off it all about 5 years ago.I am also on 50mgs of Dexedrine daily and have for decades. I usually take Nytol or whatever other over the counter sleeping meds, about 50mg diphenhydramine a night. It's not great, but it's better than nothing Asked my doctor to go back on Seroquel for a bit, as I'm having a much harder time sleeping lately, but she insisted on Trazodone. Took 50mg the first night, didn't feel great the next day, and a little down. Didn't take it again for a couple nights so that I could figure out if that was the cause. I took it one more time, and I felt AWFUL the next day. Ever since then, I've been in a horrible, depressed state and I can't shake it. How can I make it stop 😭 I was in such a good place just 2 weeks ago! Blegh. I home school my autistic 6 year old son and this is just killing me 😔
Signal	I have really really really bad anxiety. Like, really bad. I’ve had it since I was about 11, so it’s not something that’s new to me. However, I am losing my mind trying to fall asleep right now and being unable to. It’s currently 3am, and every time I’m about to doze off, I jolt awake OR feel like my heart is skipping a beat and can’t breathe which ends up giving me more anxiety because I think I am dying. It’s the worst feeling ever because I’m literally so exhausted right now that it feels like I’m typing this while half asleep. How can I fall asleep? And does anyone else experience this feeling as well? I really hope I’m not alone.
Signal	I am 14, and I have really bad insomnia sometimes, mostly caused by anxiety and ADHD/ADD. What are some ways to attempt to curb my insomnia issues?
NotSignal	It got me to sleep from 8 to 1, which was nice but even though I was tired and groggy, I couldn't fall back asleep. So I took another half of a pill. Still nothing, took the second half.... then stayed up crying until now because I completely give up
Signal	I started school two days ago, while I don’t usually enjoy school. I wasn’t exceptionally nervous or anxious for it. But alas, it has definitely triggered my anxiety which has led to this. For the last two nights, including this night, I haven’t been able to sleep. I’ve never experience this before. I’ve only experienced inability to sleep due to napping. I don’t know what to do. I have to get up in four hours and I’ve accepted that I won’t be sleeping tonight. Should I get up and start my day? Should I try again? I have so much studying to do. Help? Also, I’m super anxious that this is going to be a permanent part of my life.
NotSignal	Despite being completely exhausted, mental and physically, my brain still isn’t ready to take a break. All I can hear is everything, every little noise that I shouldn’t be paying attention to. But the more I try to ignore it, the louder it gets. Even with my fan on high, something faintly rattling on the inside keeps me up. Even with all of the lights off, there’s still a tiny bit of light coming from the window, and I can’t seem to forget about it. Earplugs? Nah, something in my ear that isn’t normally there, definitely something my stupid animal brain would be paying attention to. I just can’t get a break, my mind is way over active and I can’t make it stop. My only solution is to turn all the lights back on and cry on the couch, because what’s the point in trying if it just pisses me off more every time
NotSignal	Unless I am absolutely exhausted, I cannot sleep unless I do two things. 1) I need to be on my side with my hands clasped together and fingers interlaced. 2) I have to take the sheet and tuck it between my big toe and my second toe. On each foot. Ideally just the edge of the sheet as having it folded or bunched at all is too “distracting”.
NotSignal	I try to fall asleep like a normal person, but nothing happens. I’ll just lay there—for hours. So, I read or game or listen to tunes or mess around on the internet in hopes I’ll nod off. Eventually, I’ll start to pass out, so I shut off my phone or TV or whatever and roll over so I can fall asleep. But then...I’m immediately wide the fuck awake. Sleep is an asshole.
Signal	Second post of the day, sorry. I’ve been questionning this because , of course, I feel some side effects like a constant headache (after 8 nights of poor sleep or no sleep at all) but no other side effects? I feel pretty wired all day and people are doubting I have insomnia because I don’t look tired/sleepy and I function just fine. Am I getting more sleep than I think I am or is it common among insomniacs?
NotSignal	Does anyone have anything they could offer as help to sleep? In the past week I've gotten maybe 4 hours of sleep, and am now staying up all night in a last ditch attempt to try and get some sleep the next night. Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance
Signal	I have an interview for the admission for a university that I've wanted to go for quite a while.While I've been diagnosed with insomnia since July 19',it has nearly taken my chance away of sitting for the A levels.No doubt,it was torture when I decided to take the plunge to continue sitting for that very exam.Fast forward to now,I've gotten mediocre grades but was blessed with an amazing opportunity to attend the school,that is,if I manage to pass the interview. Although my sleep has improved significantly since last year,there are of course some days when I feel like impaling myself due to the inability to fall the heck asleep.ngl,this damn disorder has jeopardized so many aspects of my life.Im sick of it honestly . I have an interview is about 1.5 days and I'm freaking the hell out. It's 2.30 am here ,and I didn't get any sleep last night . I was supposed to prepare for the interview ystd but felt incredibly shite. **I got the call like 2-3 days ago so I'm not given alot of time to prepare,though it's still my faultSo my question is,how do I fall asleep??and how can I calm myself down?? I heard that the interviewees are nice people but I guess I'm just terrified. Anxiety and sleep disorder is just a horrible combo :-(
NotSignal	I have summer school classes and they start at 8 am but I have insomnia and sometimes 8 am is my bedtime :)I'm gonna feel like shit for this entire month, well, let's pray that they won't ask for webcam
Signal	Now I can’t get back to sleep. I’m also having anxiety hallucinations. I’d rather not describe them because that will trigger them more. So I guess I’m anxious about something.I have a house inspection tomorrow, to show a potential roommate the place. I’ve done them before so I don’t know why I’m so anxious. The last couple of inspections I’ve put on people haven’t been showing up. Anyway, guess I’ll read the whole sub. I’m not falling asleep anytime soon.
Signal	So I've had insomnia for over 7 years I was perfectly fine before then and slept very easily and soundly. Well I developed insomnia and went 2 weeks without sleep at one point had hallucinations and migraines major emotional meltdowns and shaking. I've tried so many meds. Finally found one that works. Seroquel. Lots of side effects I gained 30 lbs have missed periods but overall ik happy I can sleep
Signal	Hello all, I really need your help please. I've been suffering from what I think is insomnia for such a long time I feel like im dying. I can never sleep more than 4 hours a night and I work 50 hour weeks. I always wake up at 330-4am and cannot go back yo sleep. I have medication I take for anxiety and depression and the insomnia is just making those things worse. I cry and have panic attacks every morning. I have a psychiatrist but he only works 2 hours a week and e won't be back till June 16. I really don't know what to do, I feel like im choosing between survival and survival so its a lose lose. I need to keep my job but I'm losing my health. Please someone any advice would help. DM me if possible Thanks
NotSignal	For the past couple weeks I haven't been able to get good sleep. I try going to bed at 1-2 but sometimes I don't fall asleep until 7 am. This morning I was frustrated as usual and threw my pillow on the floor. As I laying down without a pillow I began yawning a lot and somehow I fell asleep. I don't know if this will work in the long run but I'm gonna try again later tonight
NotSignal	I'm supposed to have a surgery once the hospitals start opening back. Has anyone here ever gone under, and if so, what was your experience like? I'm curious how your recovery time went, and if your sleep schedule changed after it was over. I'm 37 now and went under when I was 23 with no issues, but now as somebody who has a sensitive nervous system and poor sleep, I wonder what I should expect.
NotSignal	Or any appointment for that matterI try to make them for later but my sleep keeps getting worseAgh
NotSignal	My sleep deprived brain just came up with the idea of having a place you could go to and hang out with other people who have insomnia and just do whatever you feel like. Like wouldn’t it be great? You’d never have to be laying awake alone again! You could all play games together, talk or just do your own thing but take comfort in the fact that there are other people around you going through the same thing. I wish there were more places open at night for people like us, once it hits 2am everything is shut at least where I live. I just love the idea of being able to go to like a 24hr cafe or something and hang out without feeling that pressure to sleep and making things worse for myself. Maybe this is already a thing I wouldn’t be surprised, I can’t remember the last full nights sleep that I got so I’m honestly not with it right now.
NotSignal	So my girlfriend has pretty bad insomnia, and gets very little sleep. We don’t spend the night together, but i was wondering if I could do anything to help her at all, or is something she just has to figure out?
NotSignal	so about 2 weeks ago, i was casually resetting my body clock from 6am to about 2am, as i have done many many times in the past. then, over the next few days, i keep having interrupted sleep, causing myself to be tired as hell the next few days, but i have never slept a full night ever since. fast forward to past few days, i sleep < 2h a night and somehow i no longer feel tired, i slept like 15mins yesterday and woke up somehow and never slept again. somehow i don’t feel much tiredness right now. will really really really appreciate any advice and if i will ever get back to normal... or am i forced to life with this shit forever...
Signal	Bit of background - I've suffered from insomnia for almost 20 years. I don't have too much problem getting to sleep - though sometimes i do - but I always, always, wake up 3 hours later and then find it incredibly difficult to sleep again. It's really wrecked my life.I started looking into why i might be waking up at night. I found some studies pointing to cortisol production in the body - you create it when you wake up - and I wondered if maybe i produced too much or something. Anyway, that led me to drugs that reduce cortisol and it led me to Ashwagandha. It's like a herbal remedy from India. There have been a bunch of studies with promising results for insomnia sufferers.Cut a long story short, I ordered some from Amazon. After 2 weeks of taking it nightly, my insomnia has improved. I still wake up but I fall back asleep much more easily now. Not perfect. But a lot better.Anyone else tried this? If you're a chronic suffer I really recommend it.I take a pretty high dose every night 2400mg (it's recommended that you take 1800 mg). My pills are 600mg each. Like I said, it took around 2 weeks before I started noticing the improvement, but it definitely, definitely, made a difference. I've been taking it for around 6 months now.Anyway that's it, I just wanted to share this as it helped me and i know how devastating insomnia is.
Signal	Hi All,I've come to a strong belief that my body is only capable of sleeping 'well' within a certain time that has probably been conditioned from uni (typically going to bed from 1 am to 3 am) from majority of the past 5 years from studying up late etc.Within the past year or so, I started working part-time in office roles with traditional 8:30AM to 5:30PM hours. This meant that I would try to go bed between 11pm to 12:30am. However, whenever I went to bed in these times, I would have insanely horrible sleep maintenance issues, where I'd wake up prematurely as if I was just taking a nap rather than a proper bed dozing time. To confirm my suspicions: The holiday period over Xmas and New Years was good for me as I could sleep whenever (office shut-down period) which tended to be 1:30AM to 3AM for a solid 7-8 hours (I still had a few rougher days in between however). I didn't wake up throughout the night, hence no major maintenance insomnia issues. As mentioned above, this was also the time I had slept during uni after studying throughout the day as I often had classes that started later in the day. The issue is that, I have been trying to go to bed between 11 to 12:30pm throughout 2019 (i.e: a year) for work and it just never improved. I have seen a CBT-i specialist and do practice general sleep hygiene along with relaxation techniques and exercise. For some reason, i just feel that my body is so wired for that time due to its lengthy conditioning over all those years that I just don't know how to sleep early and for LONG. Anyway, this is all my hunch and there are times where I do sleep fine preparing for work. But I don't have anything concrete.
Signal	So at the time it's 100 am and I've been trying to fall asleep since 9 pm and this happens a lot when I'm trying to fall asleep my brain starts thinking about the universe and whan my mind is clear I still can never fall asleep without melatonin
Signal	Try to sleep until 10:00 am or get out of bed and start my day. I have to say that i am a bit stressed bc i’ve never been in this situation in the past. I usually used to get between 2 and 4 hours per night on what i considered bad nights.
Signal	Oi bois, im j chillin, its 5:40am, n im j bored as I usually am, so I came to ask about my sleep health, if anyone had any suggestions. Im usually awake for a few days, currently its been 3days at like 12 or sm, when I sleep I get a normal \~9 hours I would suppose and feel decently awake in the morning. Im pretty surbe I have insomnia, or something of the sort, but its not even like im tired. A usual part of the experience are visuals (non hallucinogenic), they're kinda like when you first smoke or something and you just look around. Those have been fun. I also occasionally see shadow people but not fr fr iykyk. Annnyway, Its been happening for atleast a few months Im sure, maybe 6-7. It doesnt make much sense to me since a while back I could sleep anywhere, anytime, comfy asf. this is getting onto a run-on
Signal	Man I'm getting an average of about 3 hours of sleep everyday, and I have school from 7.30am to 2.30pm, and because my house is so damn far away I reach home at like 4, and by time I reach home I'm just too tired to enjoy or do anything. But I also cannot bring myself to take a nap, because if so my sleep time at night will be even more screwed.Nowadays I'm just watching boring stuff until I can fall asleep naturally at the moment, or else the anxiety just keeps coming to fuck with me.I can't focus in school and shit, can someone give me any advice? Can't really drink coffee in the morning either as I'll have to wake up even earlier for that, and I also get stomach aches from drinks in the morning.Honestly if this keeps going on is there a chance I'd even perform well academically anymore?
NotSignal	Holy shit i feel like i’m in hell today. I am so tired i feel like my brain is about to shut down. Massive brain fog and depression really fucking sucks guys
NotSignal	basically what title says, shit's getting frustrating when I only have 6 hours of sleep a day while there are vacations and nothing stressful happensdoes anyone have the same problem? or how is it called?
NotSignal	Just fucking relax! "You're gonna die if you don't go to sleep, just relax." Yea thanks because telling me I'm gonna die and yelling at me is gonna help so fucking much to get me to sleep. I'm having another rough night. I dont have them yet, but what is better Tylenol PM or Advil PM?
NotSignal	So after weeks of sleeping relatively normally, I got a sudden burst of anxiety right before sleeping. It lasted maybe all of fifteen minutes but it seemed to fuck me over in terms of sleep.For what it’s worth, I had maybe two moments where I felt as if I was drifting off, but psyched myself out by noticing and pulling myself out of that state.Anyone get this or know of a routine that could work around my body trolling me out of rest?
Signal	I am a 23 year old female. Suffering from insomnia, aggrevated by my fear of dying from the condition I think i may have. It started about a montha and a half ago.Hey there. Dramatic post incoming. Need some advice to calm down.I have ADHD and was prescribed Adderall for roughly two years and then seitched to Vyvanse 30 mg for about 3 weeks before shit went down. I was smoking concentrated THC at night. I took my vyvanse around 1 p.m that day and smoked hard around 9 30 p.m. 2 hours later my blood pressure was rising to an unusual level and this abnormal blood pressure and heart rate gradually increased until 3 hours from the onset of those symptoms. Then gradually, my bp returned to "normal" but with left arm pain and heart palpitations.Yes I have a blood pressure monitor. Yes I monitored my bp every 30 minutes when I started to detect a problem.The whole episode lasted roughly 6 hours, so my heart and blood pressure were super higher for that duration.I felt like I had a heart attack. I didn't go to the hospital durig that episode because I was scared of telling my parents I did weed. Well i regret that decision now because I now have exercise intolerance, dizziness, chest pain, and heart palpitations. I canmot exercise like I used to. I cannot lightly jog in place for 5 minutes without experiencing a drop in diastolic blood pressure.I get a wide pulse pressure whenever I exert myself, like today I had caffeine to see if I still have these heart troubles, and my bp was 122/67.That's not normal for me.I went to the cardiologist, did an echo. He found mild tricupsid insufficiency and mitral prolapse and said my heart looked healthy and I shouldn't worry about either defect.Im scared I may have Pulmonary Hypertension, caused or aggravated by that weed and vyvanse mixture. My heart was racing for 6 hours straight its quite possible this caused scarring or thickening of my pulmonary arteries.I ain't a doc, but I'm just going by my symptoms. Talking leaves me slight out of breath. My diastolic pressure does not go above 75 and can be as low as 55.I'm scared of dying. I also have elevated liver enzymes and fluid build up in my abdomen. I am going to the gastro tomorrow to discuss what the next step in investigating my liver issues is going to be.Im so scared of dying from either cirrhosis or from pulomary hypertnesion or what ever the heck I have.Cardiologist is willing to do an exercise stress test so he can see for himself what Im talking about. Im literally having palpitations right now and its not letting me sleep. I also have a dry cough that I ve had for years.Please send me your blessings. And please no one send me hate.
NotSignal	I can’t just sleep. If i could i would. I want a full nights sleep but i’m up till 8am or later then i sleep all day and don’t do my schoolwork, which then stresses me out and i don’t sleepthe cycle repeats
Signal	For a long time I've had trouble sleeping. I can only fall asleep when it's like 2 in the morning and even than I'll wake up like 6 in the morning and I cant go back to sleep. If I force myself to sleep early than I'll wake up every 2 hrs. I just end up thinking about alot when I'm in bed. I think about my life, embarrassing stuff, work, I'm starting a new college program, I think about why I've never even been on a date, my unhappiness. I'm constantly in a state of worry and fear. I'm anxious about everything and I'm scared about stuff. Theres just too much happening for me at once. I feel like im alone and doing it all and to top it off im just constantly tired. I'm exhausted 24/7
Signal	My meds havnt arrived which is bullshit considering I need them to sleep, anxiety and depression. Im on hour 27 with no sleep. It is Wednesday 6:30am now. Last time I slept was from 11pm Monday - 3am TuesdayI had a good routine before they some how havnt delivered my meds yet. Iv tried everything. Its been a good month since Iv felt like this. I hate these times, I feel so alone because even though I see people during the day, Im also awake all night. My memory is blurry aswel so I barely remember seeing my friends yestarday or going shopping.
NotSignal	Hi guys 👋 Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone. One day I stopped sleeping all of a sudden - for about 6 months.Its helpful to say that this was about 2 years after my parents’ divorce when my mother was trying to make it on her own and my sister and I lived with her. It was a complete mess. The first two weeks of not sleeping were literal hell.I did not shut my eyes for more than a few seconds every single night. I just laid there. In a low-grade panic. My skin was burning and my heart was physically sore from 14 solid 0-hour nights of sleep in a row. Sleeping pills only made me have excruciatingly scary episodes of sleep paralysis and being helplessly mauled by demon figures of my mind. There was no hope. Then my mother just about forced me to start smoking weed for the first time.I got way too high and had full-blown hallucinations while on the weed, but at about 4AM, I finally passed out. Not the best way to sleep, but I thought “I’ll take it.”So i became a weed user and continued to just destroy myself every night with heaps of marijuana.I got some sleep, but needless to say, the toll it took on my mental and emotional wellbeing was unforgiving. My grades dropped off, I stopped being able to participate in anything, really.Then my mother put me on xanax. She gave me her friends pills.And it worked.Only problem is I became physically addicted and those same pills would eventually lead me to psychosis and withdrawal seizures, as well as the new experience that the entire world is trying to kill me, including my family. I then lost my girlfriend. She couldn’t put up with it.I continued to have seizure episodes completely alone, and developed a strange yet severe intolerance to almost all foods. I sincerely thought my life was over.Luckily it was not, and my father took me back in. I was able to recover at his house by following a strict diet and using marijuana to sleep.But I was still barely getting by.Long story short I couldn’t take the constant feeling of misery and drudgery during my days, and I decided one day to take Joe Rogan’s advice and psychologically kill myself with about 3.5grams of psilocybin mushrooms.That day changed me completely and forever. I slept like a god damn baby, nothing needed.I realized it was time to leave my home, and to venture out into the world.*it was my attachments to the past that were making me not sleep*My family died - and I tried to hold onto it. I was a grown ass adult and not acting like it. So I moved all the way across the country to LA, where I got a decent job.I slept in a hostel for a while, then my boss’ house, and then I slept in a car. Then I quit that job because I found what I had been missing my whole life.I found a community of people who are dedicated to love and connection with each other, the Earth, and transcendent philosophies.These three things completely grounded me, and my insomnia was permanently cured.I’m happy to say I’m going to bed tonight worry-free of insomnia as I have been for the last 5 years.I wish you all well in finding what you truly need.I believe the mind always has something its trying to say to us - especially the subconscious mind.May your mind lead you to many great places <3
Signal	Insomnia is no joke. When I physically can’t go to sleep at night, it’s not me staying up and texting my friends. It’s me wishing I could use some form of drug to force myself to conk out. I’m exhausted. I can’t deal with as much social interaction anymore, and my brain hurts thinking about going to school. So when I passed out on my desk in science, why did you call the dean? I’m not sleeping in class, I love this class, I just can’t sleep at night. I’m hurting, please don’t make it worse.
NotSignal	Does anybody else get that weird urge to buy random stuff on amazon when they can’t sleep? Please someone distract me because I think I’mProbably about to buy some stupid shit
Signal	About 5 days ago, my anxiety just screamed through the roof. That constant feeling of flight, high blood pressure, panic in your chest, whatever. It's annoying but manageable.But since then, sleep has become a nusance.You know the old "you've got something on your mind." rubbish. Well, I don't think I do. I can think of one or two things but they've been on my mind since the end of last year, and I've been sleeping like a rock all year so far, falling asleep in minutes, getting 7 hours etc.Just lying there as usual, thinking about the usual stuff, waiting for the thoughts in my head to turn to visual which is always a sign I'm about to drift off, so I turn on my other side and bam, gone. Now though...nothing. And then after an hour or so, I'm awake and no longer drowsy and I KNOW for a fact I won't sleep now so easily.I've got anxiety every day that hightens right before I go to bed. "Oh god, I gotta go to bed and probably won't sleep."I've had insomnia in the past, badly, about 5 years ago and it lasted about 6 months. That was due to work stress and overload. No sleep for 3 nights in a row, getting maybe 2 hours a night. I don't have that now and I know how to manage it through experience (light CBT, no sleeping pills etc, this too shall pass approach); I'm getting maybe 3 to 5 hours which is bareable but still frustratingly not enough, and waking relatively frequently.It just baffles me that suddenly, one night, it's like my body or mind "forgets" how to do something as damn simple as falling asleep. I hate that we have no control over the switch of awake to asleep.I've had some bad nights in the last few years like we all do, then another, then the worry that insomnia is coming back, and then that 2nd or 3rd night I pass out and I'm back to a normal sleep schedule again.This time though, day 5, I'm getting more and more worried its' back.
NotSignal	I've been doing 20 minutes meditation per day and it's working well so far to help me with my insomnia. However, a few days ago I felt it coming back to me. It was taking longer and longer for me to fall asleep. My usual schedule is to meditate, then go on my phone for 2-3 hours, then try to sleep. I realized that I felt the most sleepy right after meditation, so I started doing it right before I go to sleep, and it worked like a charm! I realize a lot of people only meditate in the morning, and I feel like this might be the reason why some people feel like meditation doesn't help insomnia that much. So yeah, if you have insomnia and you are doing meditation to help it, try to do it right before you go to sleep.
NotSignal	Anybody ever dealt with delayed sleep? I find I'm falling asleep around 5-6am and I'm sleeping until 11. This is a real problem for me because I'm not making my hours at work. I'm taking pto to make up for the time I'm sleeping in the morning. I'm afraid I'm going to get fired but I simply cannot get up in the morning. 9am feels like the middle of the nightI've been on sleep meds since 2011 when I had my first manic episode. I got hooked on them. In the past couple of years I have found that even on the sleep meds I've been in a light sleep until early morning hours and then I am in a dead sleep until 11am. Now, I'm weaning off meds and I am straight up wide awake until 5 or 6. Please someone give me some tips that arent meds. I'm already on melatonin that I take around 7pm. I'm seeing a cbt therapist tomorrow and I hope to work on my sleep issues
Signal	I have had exactly one, ten minute doze, just long enough to have a weird dream. I've already had Lyrica, NyQuil, hydroxizine, and Unisom, spread out over the last several hours, and they are no help tonight.
NotSignal	Is this true as the title says?I've heard people say to skip sleeping that night so by the time the next day comes, you'll be tired once bedtime comes... Is this true or just plain BS if anything?My sleeping pattern is really messed up since I usually fall asleep (if I tried hard enough) around 4 or 5am the latest and wake up around 12 or 1pm.
Signal	I don't want to debate the cons of benzos, I just want to hear from those of you who may take a benzo for sleep and still struggle with sleep. For a while, on .5mg, my sleep confidence was great, and the occasional difficult night didn't worry me at all. Over the weekend, it started taking 3+ hours to fall asleep after taking it. last night it took around 5. It's like my anxiety about the possibility of not sleeping overrides the medication. Does this happen to anyone else? Even if it's not a benzo, any sleep medication. I'm curious to see if this happens to anyone else. My sleep anxiety increases the more it happens, so I guess I'm hoping to find some reassurance that this is a normal occurrence.
Signal	I'm pretty sure I have paradoxical insomnia. I'm not 100% sure but I have talked to a sleep specialist and it seems like this is the most likely answer. There's not a lot that people with paradoxical insomnia can do besides therapy. CBT-i therapy or CBT therapy and for some people these don't even work. This concerns me and I hate the idea of having to deal with this the rest of my life. I pray they find some sort of cure someday for this disorder. I hate feeling conscious all the time 24/7.&#x200B;Has anyone participated in any kind of lab or study on sleep? (besides a sleep study. I already am trying towards that) How did you get in contact with them and do one? I'm very interested. I don't mind being a lab rat at this point. I'm seriously desperate for some answers and help.
NotSignal	20, f. does anyone want to chat? im wide awake and feeling a lil empty. i have no good reason to feel this way but its sad boy hours and my mind is thinking about every worry in my life
Signal	I’ve had anxiety since i was 9 (i’m 14 now) and I’m still unsure whether this is insomnia or not.My insomnia always comes in waves, whenever i’m worried about something (it’s always something insignificant) and i’m in the middle of a wave right now, worrying about whether i’m going to get the chance to be as good as everyone else on the internet. It causes me to have little sleep, and nothing i do can help it, i’ve tried pillow sprays, meditation, and music therapy. Is that insomnia? I’ve seen a lot of different types of insomnia on this sub and i’m not 100% sure if i fall into one. Thanks!
NotSignal	Normally I have a lot of trouble sleeping but if I go to bed earlier I can usually get some sleep. Tonight I dont feel like I gonna sleep at all
Signal	I’ve been having trouble with sleeping lately. I know I have to sleep and I am tired, but I just can’t fall asleep so I keep my eyes shut and force myself to do so and this whole thing lasts about 2 to 3 hours until I do fall asleep, but I wake up too early, then have trouble falling asleep again, and when I wake up for the last time its always with a headache. If I force myself to sleep I initially get a headache then and also when I wake up. Right now I’m in this current position, I slept for about 4 hours and a half. So I drank a coffee, I still feel that dizziness you get from few hours of sleep, and also the easy triggering anxiety, so if I lay down and close my eyes I start feeling sick and anxious. Will trazodone help? I never took it before, and I also don’t know if it’s risky to take it after I drank coffee, but in the end if it’s not recommended then I could take it tomorrow night and get through this hell of a day without anything.
NotSignal	Nights are hard.. it’s on and off.. I just feel so cold..
Signal	I'm just a 15 years old boy and my sleep schedule is messed up, i am struggling at night because i can't sleep. I've tried listening some relaxing musics in youtube but it didn't work for me, i eventually sleep at 4-5 am in the morning. I also have a sleep apnea which i always wake up early so when i sleep like 4-5 am in the morning, i will wake up 7 am or 8 am. I can't control myself sleeping in the afternoon. I really need some of your advice, i will highly appreciate it😣😣
Signal	That title’s dramatic asf but it’s true. I didn’t fall asleep until like 7 and then I got woken up at 8. I went to sleep around 2:00am so I really just tossed and turned for hours. I took 10-15mg of melatonin and it didn’t do anything.(also I hadn’t taken it in months) I have HPPD so hallucinations get much worse at night. I was told you could die from lack of sleep, wouldn’t I pass out from fatigue before then? Also what should I take/do to help me sleep? Or any tips at all would be appreciated. Hope everyone’s doing well ❤️
Signal	I just got 15mg belsomra prescribed for insomnia along with 30mg temazepam has anyone had any positive or negative results with belsomra?
NotSignal	Yesterday I slept a proper 7 hours which made me feel very energised. It was nice for a change to sleep great but this also means that I am guaranteed to sleep horrible tonight and the next few nights.
Signal	So I get home at nine and i forgot to take some melatonin (10mg is the only dose that kinda helps me idk if this is important ·-·) But because I forgot I wont be able to fall asleep until around 3ish but I have to get up and ready by 6:45 to get to school because I have a 0 period (a period before the school day actually starts) so I'm freaking out and I'll have a panic attack if I lay in bed for over like 15 minutes so I'm trying to stay calm and I'm kinda panicking and idk what to do...
Signal	I've always had trouble sleeping. I wouldn't necessarily say I've always had anything like this. Mostly anxiety based insomnia before. For roughly 4 months I've been having an average of 6 hours a night, which for a 13 year old, is not alright. Recently I managed to start getting 7 hours a night with the odd really bad nights but I almost feel worse getting 7 hours than I ever did before. Every day I feel like I didn't even sleep and I have zero motivation. It's getting worse, I've tried a lot of things. I actually usually feel better at night than in the day time but the guilt makes the hours torture. I understand that there are some people way worse than me and I feel so bad for you. I'm simply posting this because I'm generally extremely creative with music and writing and I don't seem to have motivation and I'm always yawning and being tired. 6 Hours is a dream for some, I know. Stay safe and I hope that your sleep gets better, because I can't imagine how awful it must be.
NotSignal	Going to work after an especially rough night or week or month or year or lifetime is hell. That’s it. So over this part.
NotSignal	I am unable to sleep at night. I work in software and have meetings in the morning. I live in the fear that I will miss these meetings. This adds up to my anxiety. It becomes a loop. I am doing well at my job and I am being asked to take more responsibilities. But no one knows how I feel inside. I don't want to take more. This is so much painful. It's been going on for more than a year now. I have a therapist since last year but that doesn't help. I excercise and from the outside look completely fit. I took to cigarettes and alcohol. I can sleep when I am completely knocked out. I don't have craving for cigarette throughout the workday but aa night approaches, I get anxious for the coming day and get really scared. That leads me to smoke cigarettes. I am having difficulty thinking clearly and giving commitment for meetings. I don't want to talk to people. I sometimes want to cry but my tears don't come out. I tried meditation - just observing my brain as it wanders - twice a week. I was really disappointed when I told my mom all about it and she just ignored it. She doesn't even mention it in our conversation. I said No to a girl when she said she wanted to go into a relationship as I don't love myself. I have been smart and capable in my work but I feel like I'm losing it. Have some faced this?What can I possibly do to love myself more and be more confident. I want to thrive and not just survive.
NotSignal	Hey quick question,I doubt this is insomnia but I’m a 16 year old boy with good exercising habits and healthy diet. For the past week I’ve been extremely sick with the flu and I have had less than five hours of sleep each night. It’s currently 1am and I’m supposed to go back to school tomorrow because I’ve already missed so many days. I do not feel tired at all. Could this be insomnia?
NotSignal	When I was pregnant, my insomnia just disappeared. I guess from all the hormones and stuff, but I’d be able to drink a cup of coffee/tea at 3 PM and fall asleep the second my head hit the pillow! If I did that now, I’d be up all night. A lot of women got insomnia while pregnant, but my experience was the opposite. It was the first time since I started having insomnia that I was able to consistently fall asleep with no issues every night. I was hoping that maybe the insomnia was gone for good, but once I gave birth, it came back in full force. I think it might be worse now :( Any other women experience this while pregnant?
NotSignal	What i believe is stress from a recent exam has kept me up for the past 2 days and i havent felt tired at all. Should i be worried?
Signal	Hi everyone, Recently I started working overnights at our local hospital on a Covid unit which has been miserable. Not so much because of Covid, but because I cannot sleep for the life of me during the day. I started off taking melatonin and 3 Benadryl tabs with no luck. Tried Unisom and Benadryl, nope. My doctor prescribed Ambien which did nothing but make me feel TERRIBLE. Now we’ve moved on to Trazodone. I take my first dose tomorrow but I’m worried it won’t work. Anyone have any luck with Trazodone after having no luck with Ambien? Also, anyone take for daytime sleep? Thanks y’all!
Signal	Just a little self rant here I guessI’m honestly (and literally) tired of doing this to myself. I’ll stay up until 2/3 in the morning on a good night, knowing full well I have to be up at 7 or 8 the next day, and then just being exhausted all day. I skip breakfast, fuel myself on sugar and caffeine, backload all my eating to the end of the day, and do it all again.The only times I might sleep at a decent time is if my partner is here with me, and even then it’s hit and miss.I don’t know what it is, this need to stay up, to busy myself at all times, putting off sleep until the last minute.Too many nights I’ve told myself I can definitely pull an all nighter and be functioning the next day, only to pass out around 6 or 7 the following morning and getting an hour or two of sleep.I’m tired of it. I want to stop but there’s just some wall of some sort I just can’t seem to get over most of the time.Now that I’ve spent another hour l putting off sleep, browsing Reddit, and finding communities, I guess I’ll try to sleep.Sorry if this post isn’t appropriate for this sub, and I hope the rest of you have a better night than myself.
NotSignal	Whenever my sleep anxiety takes over I move away from where I usually sleep. I either sleep on the floor or even as simple as putting your head on the other side of the bed. I’m not sure why this works for me but it usually does. Rest up you got this!
Signal	hello! i’m 19F here, it’s currently 6am, and i’m very scared right now. since the recent pandemic, my sleeping schedule has been completely out of wack and my insomnia from my early high school years has come back. it’s left me terribly anxious and i’m just looking for some reassurance, or advice, or some cold hard facts. anything, really. lately my insomnia makes me go from pulling multiple all nighters, to sleeping 15 hours, to sleeping only 2 or 5 all in the same week! sometimes i nap during the day, sometimes i can’t. i can’t sleep without taking melatonin. i always try to get SOME sleep when i do all nighters but it’s usually on 1 or 2 hours. my “normal” sleeping schedule now when i can actually get to sleep and stay asleep is 8am to 2pm. i’m so scared of the affects this might be having on my body. do you think the effects are major? i don’t know what to do or how to get this under control. just scared.
NotSignal	I can't remember a single instance in my life where I didn't have insomnia. Even as a kid, I had insomnia. I think it got worse with age, but it has definitely always been there.I think I slept okay as a baby, but I have no memory of that.Has anyone else always had insomnia for pretty much as long as you can remember?
Signal	I can NEVER fall asleep without my meds. I will somewhat drift off but it’s not really a deep sleep. It’s more of like I’m asleep and can somewhat still hear my thoughts still. But when I take my meds, I can go into a deep enough sleep to keep me that way the entire night. Can this be due to anxiety? I’m a hypochondriac and think I have every sleeping disease out there. I also wake up in sweat to. I’m sure that could be anxiety. Just asking for some reassurance. Also the med I take for sleep is seroqel. Can seroquel cause daytime sleepiness as well?
Signal	I’m on trazodone and right when I’m about to fall asleeP, I catch myself falling asleep. Its like I feel my arms and legs going to bed and such. So every night I jerk myself up really quickly and go into a panic attack. Does this happen to people with insomnia frequently?
NotSignal	I for the most part hate this feeling. It’s like you try to fall asleep but you know you can’t cause insomnia is striking. The worst part is the long mental battle with the mind. It takes a toll on me the whole night.
NotSignal	I usually go to bed around 9-9:30, toss and turn for a few hours, and then wake up somewhere around 4 or 6 every morning. I know that I slept because I have dreams and shit but I never know how much I'm getting and it's starting to piss me off.
NotSignal	yes im grading cheese at 4:30 am after not sleeping for 3 days and still getting ready to start the day over again
Signal	I have not closed my eyes all night. I can't sleep I usually stay up till 6 or 7 then sleep in till 3-5.... This time I've been up all night and now I can't and don't want to go sleep. I'm constantly running shit thru my head. It's like a hamster on a wheel. It doesn't stop. I overthink I over worry. I dwell on every single problem. I'm so fed up of my life being shit. If anyone wants to talk sometime I'm down.
NotSignal	I used to have pretty bad insomnia during my last university semester. I wouldn’t sleep at all and just stay in a completely conscious trance (usually accompanied by perusing eBay). I wouldn’t sleep at all throughout the night and have no energy the next day, I also wouldn’t have the energy between 2 and 4am. This especially sucked because I could’ve been utilising that time for schoolwork if I had more energy. Anyway, I had a really good sleeping routine recently. I’d go to sleep at 9:30-10:00pm every night and wake up around 7:00-7:30 the next morning. This week I’ve decided to take a break from my regular workout routine. Since this break started I can’t sleep at all and find myself in the same loop I used to be. Would there by any chance be a correlation between my workout routine and my newly formed sleeping routine? Hopefully on Monday when I start working out again I’ll be able to sleep. I forgot how much this fucking sucks.
Signal	I been get my sleep almost back for past 2 weeks ... but a night out of the week I have a bad night .... trying not get all anxious
NotSignal	I wake up at 3 every night ,how do I change this? After that my sleep is out of wack on probably get an extra hour of sleep after that.
NotSignal	Hey everyone.Im five weeks post partum and cannot sleep no matter how hard i try. Husband and i are switching sleeping time. I cant relax and fall asleep even though im SO BEYOND tired.Going to try melatonin, whats that like?
NotSignal	So after about 3 or 4 days the body shuts down and people without insomnia will find it really hard to not fall asleep. So do you just feel tired and not fall asleep? Do u not experience that eye drooping?
Signal	I've pretty much tried every technique, from shutting off electronics, to doing relaxing hobbies, listening to calm music, taking melatonin, breathing techniques, you name it. Absolutely none of them work for me, period. What doesn't help is the fact that I'm autistic and have an anxiety disorder simultaneously as well. I am sitting in bed having an emotional breakdown because I literally don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared.
Signal	I haven't gotten any sleep for the past 2 days. I am under 15. What should I do? This isn't the first time it happened. I usually have these periods of time that can last from a couple of days to a week where I get little or no sleep. I guess one started right now. I honestly have no idea what to do. Also, I've been realizing not getting sleep is actually starting to show its effects. I was biking yesterday, and I barely lasted 10 minutes. I just felt so tired, and I couldn't figure out why. Now, it seems obvious. Once again, what should I do?
NotSignal	Has anyone else had night terrors? I haven’t had them since I was a kid, and usually I would wake up Screaming my lungs out until I was hoarse because I could see a figure at the end of my bed that wouldn’t go away until I was woken up by a parent. I had one the other night. It was just as terrifying as I remember but I didn’t see any figures. I had taken my medication really late that day, and I was finished with school late too. I decided to drink a sugary cola beverage (bad idea) and then get ready for bed. I fell asleep to Its Always Sunny (best show). I started Screaming at 2:45 am. My boyfriend woke me up obviously terrified bc he had never seen me do this. He asked me what happened and apparently I said back: “I SAW IT MOVE”. I rocked in his lap until my heart rate was semi normal and then I couldn’t sleep the rest of the night. The only thing I remember for sure from my night terror was that I was absolutely fucking TERRIFIED of this one specific part of the wall next to my bed, about the size of a baseball. Like, so scared that I couldn’t even look at it once I woke up. In the night terror I just remember it being very ‘energy-filled’ and it had small holes the diameter of a pencil poked throughout. I don’t know what any of this means. I don’t know if it’s common with ADD. But I do know that I have stopped drinking soda at night. Tl/dr: I had a ‘bad dream’ and woke up Screaming nonsense. Anyone else do this?
Signal	I was trippin that i cut my intestines out, was kinda halfawake. I dose most of the days, but today i had to get up in 5 hours. Sleep did not. Alll of the random stuff i got were a sleep paralisys, wet dream and a trip to end it all. Ow yeah btw tachycardia was a theme today. Usually i am too hot when i can't sleep, but today i was freezing. I feel like i am going nuts.
NotSignal	Pretty much what it says in the title. I sometimes snore very loud but I never did a study so I was never diagnosed, I just think I may be.
Signal	Hello. I’ve always struggled off/on with insomnia. Even as a kid I could never sleep. It goes in waves and I can go months sleeping fine and then suddenly can’t sleep. It’s been a good few years but for the past six months it’s returned due to life changes I believe. I’ve also always kind of been afraid of the dark. I’d always fall asleep with tv on or a nightlight or something. When I lived with my mom as an adult I didn’t need lights, just knowing someone else was in the house would put me at ease. My boyfriend works overnights, so he isn’t here at night. When he’s here, I sleep fine. But without him, I can’t even fall asleep. I also live in an apartment building and once I lay down I feel like I hear a bunch of noises (it could be my neighbors but considering it’s 4am I feel like I’m imagining it). I have pretty bad anxiety and of course the pandemic doesn’t help, but even before that I was dealing with this, just not to this level. I don’t have a tv in my room so I usually sleep with the light on, but even that isn’t helping me. I just don’t want to rely on him being here, because he’ll be at this job for awhile, and it’s definitely not healthy to rely on someone else for sleep and I just don’t know how to get over this. Everyone mentions melatonin to me, but I’ve heard it’s bad to overdue? I’ve also tried bed time “noises” and that doesn’t help either. Just wanting any suggestions or advice.
Signal	When I couldn't find sleep I used to listen to music to calm me down and fall asleep. Now I'm reaching a state of tiredness where I can't even feel the music and get into it, I don't have goosebumps anymore and I can't keep my attention on it, constantly deranged by random thoughts and worries. So here I am, almost 8am, tired and numb, desperately trying to get some sleep.
NotSignal	I’ve noticed on the nights I really struggle to sleep, I’m having anxiety about someone breaking into my house. It sounds like such a childish fear being afraid of kidnappers lol. I used to be afraid of that when I was a kid too.I’m a female, and I live alone. I just get worried about the Ted Bundy type or something. I’ll hear a noise and suddenly can’t sleep. Try to fall asleep with the light on, or turn my fan off so I can hear everything... then I’m too hot to fall asleep. Or I’ll finally be asleep and jerk awake because I subconsciously think I hear something or feel someone touching meRealistically I live in a very low crime area. I just think I’ve watched too many crime shows over the years. It does help when my bf sleeps over, but that’s only a few times a week
Signal	I have slept eight hours the past four days. I’m very sleepy but I just can’t stay asleep. Tomorrow I’m off work so hopefully I can catch up, but does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get through one more day at work?
NotSignal	The breathe app, i usually don’t get much use out of but i was extremely anxious last night in bed and thought i needed help getting my breathing back, and i realized you don’t even need to look at it, it has small vibrations that tell you when to breath in and out. So you can just lay down like usual and just focus on it with your eyes closed, and maybe it’ll help make you a little tired. Usually i just make up terrible scenarios in my head that make me feel like they happened and i just spiral, so i always need something to distract my mind until i can doze off. It calmed me down and made it so much easier for me to sleep. It might have been a fluke but anyone with anxiety or racing thoughts, this might help.
Signal	my insomnia recently is having one of its worst flare ups and i’m losing my shit. every other night i get 0 hours of sleep almost consistently, and i average on nights that i do sleep about 3 of me waking up every half hour and not being able to get back to sleep. i’m on seroquel prescribed for bipolar and to help with sleep and it’s doing literally fuck all, i’ve tried every over the counter sleep aid, and a combination of all, melatonin, literally everything but my sleep is still awful. benzos are the only thing that i’ve found that relieve my insomnia but i got addicted so i’ve been successfully tapering off of valium for a few weeks, (from around 20-30mg to 5mg now) i have three months worth of tolerence anyway so a couple valium do nothing. but my insomnia is awful and i can’t live with it. 8 hours because i take 3 vallies sounds a lot better than 0. i’m thinking once i taper off and ditch my tolerence (mostly) by being off them for a few weeks going back so i can actually fucking sleep, but i’m not sure how i can do that without just getting physically addicted and tolerant. is every other week for a month and then a two week break or something ok? maybe 3 nights a week? i don’t know. i just need suggestions. i’ve tried everything legal and illegal and benzos are the only thing that help but the withdrawals and tolerance are driving me insane. any advice on how many i can do a week or month or whatever without getting addicted would be appreciated.
NotSignal	Guys I got into a vicious cycle of not sleeping for days on end. When I do sleep like the day before yesterday I ended up waking up at 3 am and unable to go back to sleep. My feet /legs felt restless and all I could think was about my legs wanting to move. How are you guys combatting insomnia? Is there a cure ? Also I make sure I hike before bedtime to tire myself.
Signal	Does it work? I'm looking for more natural ingredients to take and melatonin alone doesn't do the trick
Signal	Regular 10mg Ambien got me 2 hours at least. I figured maybe the 12.5 cr would be better and everybody including me had high hopes for me finally sleeping tonight...I feel like crying tbh. Day 9 with less than 5 hours even with Ambien, clonidine, hydroxyzine, melatonin, ashwaghanda, and gabapentin. I'd switched to Ambien bc tolerance to lunesta (which also only gets me 1-2 hours at a time).. It'd put down a gorilla yet not me, a 120lb female human. I don't know if there's ever an end...I meditate before bed, follow all the sleep hygiene rules... I just want to sleep damn it
NotSignal	Some nights I can sleep almost more than 5 hours most of the nights I’m up through out the night
Signal	I really want to give it a try because it’s almost always 100% effective but i’m scared I’m gonna be up for days at the begining. If I do it i’m gonna have to do it by myself since no therapist in my area seems to know about CBT-I. My insomnia is induced by anxiety and one of my worst fear is to be up for days not knowing when i’ll crash. I don’t have a consistent sleep parttern. This past week i’ve been getting 3/4hours of sleep per night sometimes none. No matter how sleepy I am I always end up not being able to fall asleep whenever I hit my bed.I’m confident that it could work long term but I feel like stimulus control (getting up and doing something else when not sleeping) would just make me more anxious? Like while doing something else when i’m not sleeping there’s always a thought in the back of my mind that’s alert that i’m not sleeping and sees this as a threat... Just want some feedback and maybe some resurance. Thanks
Signal	Hi friends,I’ve battled insomnia my entire life. I’m now 30. My first prescription for Ambien was when I was only 8. It was back before it came as a RX but in a “sample box” from my pediatric psychiatrist. It wasn’t something my mom was comfortable keeping me on, for obvious reasons. I didn’t start the RX again until late teenage years. I remember staying up all night, playing with toys all alone in my room. Bored to tears while the rest of my family slept perfectly. I’m now married with 2 kids. Still battling crippling anxiety and insomnia. I’m not looking for tips on how to help with the insomnia, believe me I’ve tried everything in the book. Warm baths, lavender, sleep journals, mediation, yoga, massage, hypnosis, acupuncture, you name it, it’s already been done. I’ve tried ambien, lunesta, ambien -XR, trazadone (awful experience), belsomna (sp) and every benzo in the book. My last sleep doctor saved my life with a high dose of ambien (2 pills at night, with 2 klonopin). One day the pharmacy reported him for over prescribing and I myself was flagged as a potential abuser. Since then, I’ve suffered extreme anxiety and depression, as any doctor whose seen me looks at a medical chart and refuses to help. I do have a sleep doc but she’s so incredibly conservative that she’ll only prescribe 1 ambien per night, with one very mild benzo (restoril, it does nothing for me). She has me on a ridiculous, ineffective regimen of light therapy from a box In the morning and blue light goggles at night. It does not help and if anyone else out there has struggled, you know this. Has anyone seen a neurologist for help with sleep disorders and how was your experience? I’m hoping for better and more progressive (western medicine that’s not so conservative) means of efficacy. I’ve already accepted my life as a serial insomniac that will need medicine the rest of my life, it’s finding a doctor that agrees and is willing to continue prescribing these controlled substances in lieu of ridiculous alternative measures. Thanks in advance.
NotSignal	Took a NyQuil at 11PM, 1:35am still can't sleep. My roommate fell asleep with airpods in so I can't wake them up when they're snoring with my usual tactics (making small noises until they roll over). I haven't slept well in about a month now. I'm starting to lose my mind.
NotSignal	I haven’t been able to sleep at all this week. I keep seeing flickering and flashbacks to when my parents split up. Should I be worried?
NotSignal	This has never happened to me before. Today marks the day i went to sleep at 12 pm which is the higjest ive gone. Tried sleeping, tossing and turning but my body wasn’t tired which frustrated me, which then leads me to try to force myself to sleep and boom, here comes a fast heart beat with the pulse that i feel in my chest. Yesterday i slept better with about 8-9 hours and the day before 7 hours i believe. This whole anxiety (or insomnia idk what it is) is terrible man. I want to sleep like how i use to which was me getting tired around 3-5 am and i never worried about if i was going to sleep or not. Now it’s been a week and ever since i felt an irregular heart beat, i wasn’t really able to sleep as good as i use to. Is sleeing at 12 pm dangerous with only an hour or 2 of sleep ? I would like to know how people handle sleeping very very late
Signal	I take Trazodone 50mg for sleep (used to take 100 but it increased my heartburn), recently it's taken alot longer to get to bed and last night it got so bad, I took an additional 25mg (half pill) and finally got some sleep. Two things have changed I've been under more stress because I have to decide about my going back to Work post covid (I also have a ton of stuff to do to keep my professional certifications) and they changed my brand of generic Trazodone. Previously I always thought take Trazodone right before bed with a small amount of water just enough to get it down as the pill is supposed to just disintegrate and go it's supposed to get into the bloodstream right away. But these don't do that they are a harder pill that would take more time. Should I be taking these like normal or perhaps breaking them into a half and taking both of them. The half seemed to work fairly quickly. Any advice on this or link would be appreciated
NotSignal	Anyway idk why but i hate it and I’m so tired and everything tastes disgusting. And I just want to sleep so bad I might just chug a bottle of niquil. Help me
NotSignal	Over the past week I have been having really vivid and intense nightmares. Nightmares that I can’t wake myself out of and when I do eventually wake up I am frozen in my bed, unable to move and completely disoriented. Takes me a solid minute or two to realize where I am. I know I am somewhere familiar but can’t put my finger on exactly where I am. Towards the beginning of quarantine I wasn’t having issues sleeping, which is pretty rare for me. I have struggled with staying asleep for years (on and off) but this is different.Has anyone struggled with similar issues and if so how did you cope? I am starting to fear bedtime and end up staying up so late because the thought of going to sleep and dealing with one of these episodes terrifies me.
NotSignal	Does anyone else struggle with this?I’ll sleep like a baby on days that I work, as I’m not even thinking about sleepOn my days off, though, I get the worst possible sleep. Every. Fucking. Time. It’s so strange. I assume it’s because I’m actively thinking about sleep, and thinking about sleeping in The next morning, I’ll wake up with my heart racing, and very restless, like I haven’t slept at allIt honestly has started to make me hate my days off, as what’s the point If I’m just going to feel like shit all day
NotSignal	Im already expecting answers like "Don't" "throw them away" etc....Has anyone used these and had luck?My job requires me to be on the computer all day and on the phone most of the nite answering customer emails.If you've had success with these how did you use them? All day? Only during screen time? Before bed? Etc...Thanks
NotSignal	I’ve had trouble to stay asleep for two weeks now. I usually go to bed around 11ish and wake up at 6 for work. Now for some reason I’ve been waking up earlier each day, first at 4 am, then at 3, and now at 2! Last night I got so frustrated that I just stared crying in my bed.I’ve tried relaxing, herbal tea, breathing exercises, warm milk, and even pills (over the counter). I’ve basically tried everything short of heavy drugs. Nothing seems to work and I’m starting to unwind. Please help!
Signal	I cannot sleep for more than 3 or 4 hours at a time. Ever.I know it is stress-related, but I have tried everything... weighted blankets, body pillows, podcasts, silence, complete darkness, snuggling with a puppy, no caffine - at all, not drinking alcohol, or drinking alcohol, melatonin, sleepytime tea, baths, exercise.... dude I could go all day. I wake up refreshed but within a few hours I'm back to being lethargic and tired. Coffee just makes me anxious.I am just CONSTANTLY sleepy. At first it was from getting sleep paralysis combined with false awakenings. I was freaking scared to sleep... now I just can't sleep much at all.It has been months and if I dont get a good nights sleep soon, I am going to lose my mind. I work full time and go to school, I can't afford this right now.
Signal	Hi everyone, I was prescribed Xanax in 2015 after having become tolerant to ambien. I was 19 and knew the dependency was bad nor did I like the next days hangovers heading to class in college. So, my psych prescribed me Xanax. And A LOT of it. A lot meaning I still have bottles to this day. I finally stopped taking it January 2019 while I was staying in LA for a month. Easy access to weed did the trick. I had originally been prescribed .25 mg Xanax but very quickly jumped to .5 and then 1 and then 2mg and then sometimes 2.5 or so as the night went on and I lay awake. I had gotten used to half of the next day being a sluggish fog. I also got into a habit of getting drinks and then falling asleep from that, but I have a gene mutation that makes it hard for my body to process alcohol and my body’s ability to drink has rapidly declined over the past two years (it also triggers ocular and aural migraine episodes for me). Since Jan 2019 I have used marijuana most nights to fall asleep but have been able to fall asleep by my own sometimes, a BLESSING. I’ve dealt with insomnia since early childhood, since I can remember with progression into middle/high school when I was finally diagnosed but my doctor didn’t want to prescribe me meds and that was that as my family didn’t give me the option of a psych or therapist. I would go to school on 1 hour of sleep, throw down caffeine, pass out for an hour or two when I got home. I started taking my dads ambien in high school. Funny thing is when I was a toddler I would spring out of bed at sunrise. My dad is the same way, but actually falls asleep when he takes his ambien. Now that we are in lockdown, I don’t feel safe purchasing weed nor can I really do that. I also had covid (per multiple doctors suspicion, but could not acquire a test in nyc area) so I am a bit afraid to smoke at all after having had trouble breathing for weeks. My one friend is too scared to send me edibles in the mail. I’ve fallen back into taking Xanax and even my old bottle of ambien. I’m doing grad school remotely and have been unable to fall asleep even with these drugs until after 4 am. Not being able to wake up until 12 has caused problems. I’m desperate for help. I do not want to keep taking pills. I meditate at least twice a day, including before bed. Now the sound of any guided meditation fills me with rage. I can pass out doing it during the day or afternoon but it’s a different story at night. I’ve tried hypnosis. I do daily exercise classes. I take magnesium. Melatonin. I’ve tried the nights where I just wait and lay awake the whole time hoping to build the exhaustion and eventually pass out after days of that. Then I got covid. Every single night I tell myself I will force myself to wake up early to reset my circadian rhythm but I am like a rock from the Xanax. I cling to sleep once I have it, too. I’m desperate for help. I don’t have access to a psychiatrist anymore and my therapist has been no help. Living alone during this and have very minimal support systems (friends and family).Anything please 🥺
Signal	I have been experiencing hypnik jerks for two months now. Every night i am having hypnik jerks and I can't sleep till I take clonazepam. I went to a doctor and he said this is anxiety and I have to take anti-anxiety meds. The problem is whenever I take a tablet from any anxiety medication the jerks get worse and the normal dose of clonazepam won't be effective anymore.Anyone had the same problem? And is there a solution? I know the solution is to take anxiety meds, but as I said they make my case worse.
Signal	I slept like a baby all last week and today I can’t even pretend like sleep is going to happen.It’s a never ending cycle for me. I’m fine for a week and then a 3 day cycle of complete and utter bullshit until I get so tired that I just pass out. Then it happens all over again. Fine for a week and then awake for 3 days.It’s like I get so anxious about sleeping that it causes me not to sleep. Like, who the fuck gets anxiety about sleeping?! Sleeping is GREAT.Sometimes if I can’t stop thinking about things that stress me out I’ll go over a list of all the things I would do if I won a billion dollar lottery, but a lot of times that doesn’t work and my thoughts go into a dark place.How do you guys deal with your wandering mind?
Signal	I just don't want to lay here anymore. Is it okay to pull an all nighter?The only problem is I won't be able to sleep for a long while since I'm very sensitive to sounds and it's never ever quiet.My anxiety tells me that staying awake for more than 24 or 30 ish hours will kill me. I'm scared of not being able to sleep the next day after the all nighter and then go insane???This is why I've forced myself to lay in bed until I sleep and devote my whole day to sleeping if I have to, but I just don't think I can do it this time.
NotSignal	I thought I'd share what works for me when I just cant sleep. Theres a YouTube Channel called ASMRGO. It's all natural sounds like Birds and Water, the Sea etc. But they are long enough to actually get to sleep and not full of advert that wake you up. Just thought it may help someone. Good Sleep everyone 🌼
Signal	Feels like I really need to focus things twice in order to confirm what I was thinking. I hope that I can sleep well tonight. I just can't sleep.
NotSignal	So as the title says on the nights I have trouble getting to sleep it's usually a song (any little tune) gets Stuck in my head on a loop and it's so hard to block out so I get to sleep. It's so hard as I need to to be up early (4:30-5am) to go to work & the nights I can't get to sleep I'll only get a maximum of maybe an hour or 2 of sleep. Does anyone else have this issue or is it just me
Signal	I understand that i struggle sleeping and usually lie awake for up to 2 hours, a lot more regularly the past few years and I've always been told that everyone else relates and some people seem super condescending. Idek what to think about it. I have an exam tomorrow, I've revised for 3 hours after food until around 10 Pm, and I just stared into space immediately after till half 1 in the morning. I went on my phone and it's been an hour. Am I just doing this to myself?
Signal	It could be whether I eat too late at night or too early, whether I excercise or not ,whether I drink water before bed or dont drink at all. Every minor thing in the bed; the pillow, the sheets, the temperature. The most insignificant sonds start to feel so obnoxious and irritating. Using my cellphone or trying to watch a movie. Every fucking thing has an effect on my sleep , always for the negative. I am physically and mentally tired as hell, crawling in my bed thinking what the fuck is it this time.... Is it my bladder? Is it my god damn mind that actively tries to sabotage itself? I cant believe this, I seriously cant believe this shit. It shouldnt be like this. Something as basic and fundamental as sleeping shouldnt feel like a god damn algorithmic problem. It makes no sense. Why would our brains function in this broken, counterproductive manner? A lot of diseases I can understand them, but no this crap. I am constantly fighting against myself and every day, no matter how exhausted I feel, the sense of dread that comes with the night, knowing that its just going to be like all the nights before, is always there. Insomnia is a nightmare you cant sleep away from.
NotSignal	<TL-DR> I'm looking for anyone who has had success with CBT-I to cheer me on to stick with this, because the first few weeks have been really hard and I'm not seeing "instant" results. \--Longer story: Hi everyone. My story in brief: I was never a great sleeper. I had my first baby in January, and although she's been sleeping through the night since 14 weeks old, it's been a beast to get back to any semblance of normal sleep. Months of disrupted overnight sleep from baby feeding and pregnancy pains just got me totally out of whack. Additionally, my husband is a doctor and has been working through the pandemic, leaving me caring for a new baby for months all alone. I would go to sleep dreading the next day's endless baby duties and loneliness. It was a really tough slog. Life has improved somewhat now that I'm back to work, the baby is older (and easier), and with COVID caseloads down, we were able to hire an excellent mother's helper. However, even though things are more "normal", sleep issues have become their own thing for me. I found myself unable to fall asleep quickly despite being exhausted, and waking at the tiniest little noise (I blame mom-ears.). I was wandering around the house at all hours, doing every stupid thing to help fall asleep- meditation, melatonin, benadryls, exercising, etc. The only thing I have not done is any kind of hard-drug sleep meds or SSRIs. The sleeplessness was really wearing on my marriage and my joy of motherhood, so I finally found a therapist who specializes in insomnia and peri-natal issues to begin CBT-I. Things seemed to get better the first two weeks just by keeping a sleep diary. But after the assesment, I feel like I'm back into hell. I'm on day 10 of my sleep restriction regimen. I'm supposed to sleep from 12:15-6:30 AM. The first four nights of the regimen, I actually got less sleep than before I began, since I still had trouble falling asleep and now had to wake earlier and be out of bed. I averaged about 4 hours a night. Since then, I've had good and bad nights. After a string of pretty good nights on vacation, I had a horrific one last night that kept me and hubs up all night and ended with us ugly-fighting in the morning about why I can't just get my act together and sleep, even though I'm exhausted. This is just really, really hard and I sometimes feel I'll never beat back this mental beast of "will I sleep tonight?" - type thoughts. My therapist is strongly encouraging me to stick with it, and comparing it to a long-term lifestyle change like a diet or training for a race, but that's really hard to feel good about when every night feels scary. Please, someone on here give me hope that I will be able to fall asleep again someday. It would be really helpful for me to hear your success stories with CBT-I.
Signal	So i have been having trouble sleeping all my life. But yesterday i had something horrifying happen to me. Basically i was trying to sleep and as i was starting to pass out i started hearing voices and seeing some weird patterns. And i snapped back to reality. I was having a muscle spasm on my neck and i couldn't move. This passed in 10 seconds. I called ER and they convinced me i didn't have a seizure. Then about 2 hours later i tried to sleep again. But the same thing happend. I started hearing voices and instantly snapped back to reality. And now im sleep deprived asf and too terrified to sleep. What can i do guys?
NotSignal	I feel like my body and mind is really tired but I still think too much does anybody experience the same thing ?
NotSignal	I'll keep telling them how bad my insomnia is and they'll respond by giving me generic sleep hygiene tips and recommending popular sleeping supplements that would be of use to people without long term insomnia? The nerve of some people, I'm so incredibly angry. Sometimes they'll express sympathy, but not enough sympathy. They might say something like "that sucks", disgraceful. Sometimes they'll say that they "struggle with their sleep too". This angers me as I know for sure my struggle with sleep is much greater than theirs! Does anyone know how I can make this stop? Other than bringing it up less often obviously.
Signal	I’m so tired of waking up having slept 4 hours and working a 9 hour shift doing physical labor. I wake up at 1:45 AM on the dot every morning, then toss and turn in bed until 3:45 AM when I have to get ready for my shift at 5. I wake up early enough as is, and I’m so tired all the time. I’m gonna call my psychiatrist today but right now it’s 3:37 and it’s about time to wake up. :)
Signal	Hello dear redditors. I really hope you can help me with the following issue: I've been suffering from insomnia for the past 2 months. It started to occur pretty much out of the blue during an exam phase at college which is why I thought it was due to stress at first. But even weeks after the exams I kept struggling to sleep. I went to the doctor's who drew blood and checked me through but she said that everything was normal and that I was perfectly healthy. Blood pressure, pulse rate, thyroid... the results were perfectly fine. As soon as she had those results she pretty much wanted to shelve my case even though I came in two more times trying to get across how frustrated the whole situation was for me and how unhappy I was. Her reaction was anything but empathetic in my opinion. I felt like she was annoyed and she kept telling me that I was certainly not the only person in this world suffering from insomnia and basically that I'd have to learn to deal with it. She ended up prescribing me sleeping pills which obviously helped me for a while. When I stuck to my guns she also mentioned that maybe I should try to book an appointment with a psychotherapist since the problem could be of psychological nature. The problem is that I'm from Germany where getting psycho therapy is very difficult because all psychotherapists are booked out for months or even years. When the pills were used up I surprisingly managed to sleep more or less well for another 2 weeks. But now I seem to be back at square one. I think I tried everything. Teas, creating a bedtime routine so my body knows it's bedtime, autogenic training, meditation, yoga, exercising, valerian, magnesium... helped little to nothing. As soon as I go to bed, no matter how tired I feel, whenever I turn the lights off my mind begins to race. No matter how hard I try to focus on breathing or telling myself that everything is going to be ok my mind starts to spiral and sooner or later I start crying because the anxiety is unbearable. Sometimes I also experience palpitation. It kills me that to me there's no reasonable explanation for this. I'm not stressed at the moment nor do I have any conscious fears or worries. During the day I rarely feel anxious btw. I'm a highly sensitive person which is why I need sleep very badly to recover and process stuff. The fact that isn't possible at the moment makes me feel so desperate and sad so I really, really could use any help or advice!! Has anyone among you experienced something similar?Thanks in advance (also sorry if there are any grammatical or spelling errors, I'm not a native speaker)
NotSignal	I have anxiety and problems woth sleeping for two weeks now. I would usually wake up once or twice during the evening amd than early in the morning anxious. Now i wake up every half an hour ( i take misar sr with prolonged working and something on bio basis). In the morning i take misar mr thats workinging instantly and than im even more tired but still not really sleeping. What to do??? I went to therapist and those were my therapy so far... also am s scared i will get addicted to this if i take it for too long, are antidepressives working better?
NotSignal	Got insomnia out of nowhere.Night 1 = 4 hours of sleepNight 2 = maybe 5,5 hours of sleepNight 3 = 2 hours of sleepNight 4 = 4 hours of sleep then being awake for 5 hours and getting a 1,5 hour nap.Was awake like 38 hours between night 3 and 4Am I ok in the (probably) short term?
Signal	Like the title says every night I keep waking up every hour on the dot. I know this because my clock is next to my bed. Is there any way to fix this because I feel exhausted throught the day.
NotSignal	Dear. Your mind is too active and too curious at night or during the time when you need to sleep. You got questions that are almost impossible to answer and it makes you anxious already. Pause. Think of your bedroom while you're laying down instead. Relax. Breathe in and breathe out. Think of your bed and how comfortable you are in it. Take a look at the things around your room and what are the little things that made you put them in your room. What are they made up of? Why are they in there, in that enclosed room with you? If you're done and still can't sleep, take a look at your body. No need to stand up and get a mirror. Stay still in your comfy sleeping place. Scrutinize every inches of your body. Think of how healthy and almost perfect they are. Meaning to say, no sickness. No disabilities. Organs are functioning well. Breathing. Just plain you. You, in your room. Living in this world with other beings and you're here, about to sleep. Thankful for all the neglected blessings you're too preoccupied to see. Disregard for a moment those far away dreams or goals. The kind of dreams that keep you pressured and stressed; and not pleased and contented for what you currently have. Remember, there's gonna be a different day for you to restart. Life may be short as they say, but we all have different paces in our lives. Try to appreciate more and worry less. Be happy✨I hope this helps for my fellow sleep deprived people💘
NotSignal	Okay so I made a post before about staying up and sleeping the next day. I actually made it to the next night and fell asleep for 10 hours. But now it’s midnight the next night and I fell asleep at 10 but woke up at 12 and I’ve been trying to sleep for an hour and a half now and nothing. I feel fully awake now.What do I do from here? I’ve tried everything from sleep aids, to wearing down my body, nothing works. My room is completely pitch black, and I leave my window open a bit so that it’s cool.
NotSignal	I’ve never struggled with sleep. I’ve always just gotten tired and gone to sleep at night. However, the past five days I just have not gotten tired. The first night it happened, I was stressed out about a work evaluation and didn’t sleep at all, but even after doing well and passing, I remain completely unable to sleep. It seems like I’m up until about 6-7am, then just poof, 2 hours goes by and suddenly I’m conscious again. That’s been the extent of my sleep. Now my work schedule has changed this week and I have to be up at 5:45. It’s 1:45 now and I’m showing no signs of getting tired.I’m an air traffic controller. I have to be able to think at a high level to successfully do this job. I can’t perform with no sleep. I have no idea what to do and I need help.
NotSignal	Just wondering how many people use melatonin every night to sleep. Also how many mg, is it pills?, spray?, or gummies. Also is melatonin dangerous?
Signal	I just came back from seeing my doctor and he took me off of clonazepam and upped my topamax dosage from 25mg to 50mg. I took clonazepam for just over a month before it became completely useless to me and he had concerns that upping the dosage would put me at risk for dependency and I agreed so he put me on amitriptyline. Does anyone have any experience with it?
NotSignal	death doesn’t seem really scary. it doesn’t seem like much of a release either. its just ceasing to exist. you’re not conscious of it. your brain doesn’t make connections. your body decays. out of the hundreds of billions of people that have ever existed. why should one life matter. maybe someone did amazing things in their life- and i believe that should be celebrated, but death is something that always happens. its unavoidable. and thats why i don’t feel scared. sure, its kinda weird knowing ill not exist someday- but i know that i need to make each day special, so i don’t regret the one chance i have.
Signal	I usually decide to try and fall asleep at 9pm, and I usually set my alarm to 5am it's an 8 hour time. Most of the days it's just lieing and turning in bed, for 4 hours and watching YouTube for the rest. I get sleepy at 2pm, and i get less sleepy until 6pm and I get exhausted at 9pm. If I get sleep it usually goes like I wake up randomly during the night, and I wake up feeling like a pile of crap thrown into a washing machineThis is how my sleep has been for 3ish years. During the day I'm irritable, and I fake being energetic. I usually fall asleep during class and teachers have even asked me why this was happening. I feel anxious about sleep as 9pm approaches, and I even cry into my pillow when I'll have anything important to do at school.I tried everything. Meds(amplifies my general anxiety and makes me lethargicMeditation just won't work tireing myself out by excersize just get me more tired and sweaty. Teas only work occasionally.There is one thing working 10/10 times, but it's unavailable for medical use where I live. It's weedShould I see a doctor? And what kind?
NotSignal	I'm (22F) currently suffering from sleeping problems, finding it very hard to fall/stay asleep, and suffer from nightmares quite often. My physician just prescribed me with Tamazepam to help me fall asleep. The reviews online are a bit wishy washy, anyone have first hand experience with this drug?
Signal	Like many others on this forum, I’ve gone down the fatal insomnia rabbit hole during my bouts with insomnia, but I think my scare was more severe than most. At one point about a year and a half ago, I was so convinced I had SFI (sporadic fatal insomnia) that I stopped working (which almost destroyed my career), I couldn’t eat, I lost an unhealthy amount of weight, and almost had to be hospitalized in a psych ward. This was after weeks of only getting about 3-5 hours of sleep a night, and this insomnia pretty much started AFTER I was convinced I had the disease. What led to the initial belief was one night of poor sleep and also some weird symptoms, like extreme pain in my stomach and heartburn. I know these symptoms don’t add up to fatal insomnia but that didn’t matter - no one and nothing could dissuade me from the idea that I had it as soon as the sleeplessness really kicked in. Finally, I was put on remeron and sleep returned overnight. I was also put on a low dosage of Klonapin (a benzo) which I’m now tapering off of. Once I started sleeping again, my earlier paranoia about SFI seemed distant and silly. But as I started tapering off the benzos a few weeks ago I had another bout of insomnia and the delusion came roaring back. Part of what spurred it on was reading an AMA written by a 17 year old kid who claimed he had sporadic fatal insomnia. He wrote this post back in December or November I think with a throwaway account. What I’m curious about is whether other people think his post is real or fake - you can find it by simply searching "fatal insomnia reddit" on google. His post made the disease more real to me, so I’m hoping that it’s fake. There are some weird details that don’t add up like the fact that a sleep specialist who did a study on him told him that he PROBABLY had the disease despite how exceptionally rare it is, even before a PET scan or any genetic work was done.
Signal	OK. Picture this. Its December 24th 2009, your parents have just put you to bed and as soon as their foosteps disappear down the stairs, you pull out your Nintendo DS and start playing Super Smash Bros. At midnight you hear your parents come up the stairs and when they go into their room, you creep into your siblings room and wake them up. You sit on their bed and you take turns playing Zelda and other games, until you notice the time has passed quicker than you expected it to. It's now 4am and you climb back into your bed and try to fall asleep. You are to excited and cannot sleep. You play some more rounds of Super Smash Bros and at 5am you wake up your sibling with a gentle shake and whisper "Wake up its Christmas!!" Your sibling jumps out of bed and you both proceed into your parents room to ask if you can get up yet. They say no and you go into your room and play with eachother until your parents decide to get up and take you downstairs.This always works for me as it eases my nerves and reminds me of better times. Times when we were younger and thought we were ontop of the world. I hope this works for you to, and if it doesn't, search up "The Tucker Zone" on YouTube. It mentally exhausts you and gets you ready for sleep. By Friends 🐦
Signal	second time this has happened in the past 2 weeks. anxiety keeps me up, melatonin helps somewhat when i remember to take it. i want to sleep rn but the light from the curtains is bothering me and i cant and its making me feel mad but i can’t do anything because i have a splitting headache and feel nauseous
NotSignal	I don't know if i have insomnia, but i find myself laying with my eyes closed for hours trying to sleep, sometimes i cant tell if i fell asleep during it but mostly i am awake just trying to sleep and it doesnt happen its like a weird in between state. is this common?
NotSignal	Every spring I go through a phase of insomnia. It can last 48-100ish hours. It has happened for as long as I can remember, some years are worse than others. Last year I was at 77 hours when the auditory hallucinations started. By 84 hours I was seeing scary shadow men out the corner of my vision. At 95 hours I went to the hospital because I could no longer function or properly care for myself or family. I’m at 47hours and 40 minutes with zero sleep as I’m writing this. What’s your longest stretch with absolutely no sleep? What have you experienced? Does anyone else have an annual week where they just can’t sleep? Maybe I’ll keep updating this, have a record for morbid curiosity.
NotSignal	Back to school work today after two nights of 4 hours. I knew that if I decided to not do much work, I'd just sit feeling sorry for myself, so I absolutely overloaded myself and decided to do over half of my weekly work in one day. I'll tell you this - it's been the best day of work so far since the lockdown. My real question is just how? Why am I better at concentrating when I'm tired? I'm happier for sure when I sleep well and I feel quite depressed but in terms of work, I'm really smashing it today and I don't really understand it.
NotSignal	Something I've been doing lately that I've had a lot of success with, is taking the pressure off of sleep by propping myself up on my pillows, leaving my light on, and turning on a very long YouTube playlist that I've already watched which is just engaging enough to be distracting but not so interesting I can't veg out with it on (I've been exclusively using primink's "internet stories" playlist on shuffle for this), then closing my eyes and trying to doze. Thus far it's worked every time (not tonight so far but I think it starting with a video about Shane Dawson from years ago before all the controversies came to light isn't exactly helping me NOT get riled up again). But that's also the only way I've been able to fall asleep a few nights in a row now.So my question is... What gives? Why can't I do more than lightly doze if my light's off and the room is quiet? Is it just still too much pressure when I'm trying to recover from a really bad week of sleeping attempts last week?Anyone else have a similar experience?
Signal	I have insomnia on top of sleep apnea. I am a mouth breather so I need a full face mask for cpap which is impossible for me to wear . I tried for 6 months and just couldn’t do it . I get so jealous of my gf. She can fall asleep on a rock and stay sleeping for hours . Every little noise wakes me up. Cars driving by starting at 4 am give me anxiety cause I know I only have a few hours left to try to sleep. I get like 2 hours sleep a night and I’m just absolutely miserable . I would b a completely different man if I actually got some rest. I gave up on the sleep dr- it just seemed like a serious money grab with little help for me. Guess I just go on like this , I’ll b 47 in May and the no sleep just gets to me even more the older I get . Nobody understands why I always feel like crap . I dunno - sometimes I just wish I wouldn’t wake up .
NotSignal	My severe insomnia (total inability to fall asleep) started 2 weeks ago, and I either get no sleep or 1-3 hours a night. But I always close my eyes for the entire time. It’s also to the point where I can’t tell if I slept or not. I read a comment somewhere that eyes closed is good enough and you won’t suffer consequences of insomnia. Is this true?
NotSignal	Do you guys have any tips for shutting your minds off?
Signal	I’ve taken my sleep meds around 10:30pm and now at 3:30am I’m unable to sleep. Should I wait until the lecture starts or try to see if I can manage a 1-2 hour nap?I also have ADD and use vyvanse and not sure if it’ll be best to use it after no sleep but I can skip a day from that medication. What should I do?
NotSignal	Whenever I'm severely sleep deprived (thankfully less often now), I have absolutely no desire to do anything other than the bare minimum. If I'm not obligated to do anything, I just feel like sitting in front of the computer and vegetating. I truly wish I had the energy to accomplish more as a result of having more time from not being able to sleep.
NotSignal	As the title sugests i cant fall asleep in mybown room but as soon as i get in another room i dont have that problem anymore what could it be?
Signal	Currently awake after laying in bed for 6ish hours, I've got work in 2 hours. I used to sleep, not good, but a solid 8 hours every night. I had a little spell of having trouble falling asleep about 5 or 6 years ago, but that solved quickly after a short while of occasionally falling asleep with melatonin, but in the last few years I have started to more occasionally having to rely on melatonin to make sure I fall asleep if I have a work or schoolday coming up the next day. I hate sleeping with melatonin. It works horribly inconsistent and if I fall asleep while I've taken melatonin, I pretty much always wake up with a slight headache and never feel truly rested like a normal night's sleep. For the past 4 years, I have been able to fall in a deep sleep, especially after getting a new matress, fairly easily. However, this last month I can not for the life of me fall asleep when I have a workday coming up the next day. Melatonin doesn't work, everytime I try and focus on not thinking about whatever, I can't control my thoughts for more then a minute and I get extremely agitated from not being able to sleep to the point where I get aggressive, punching my wall or head because I'm so frustrated. The last 2 weeks it has spiraled into me also not being able to sleep when I don't need to set an alarm for anything, which usually meant I would sleep for 9 to 10 hours naturally to make up for the loss of the previous night. I started taking melatonin on those nights too to make sure I have a chance of making up for the sleep loss, but like I said, it barely works, and if it does, it sucks ass. I'm currently laying in my bed, with a slightly bloodied hand from the wall as this is the third night I can't sleep and I am crying because I want to be able to just sleep again, those solid eight hours, that ironclad schedule I had forced myself into after my first small sleeping problems 5 years ago. I am so scared.
Signal	Two nights ago I pulled an all nighter because I had an appointment at 10am. Knew I would fall asleep at 5-6am and then miss the appointment because of that. Last night I didn't sleep until 10pm because I somehow just wasn't tired. Woke up multiple times during the night but was able to get back to sleep. I didn't wanna be getting up at like 3am. Woke at 9am. Usually once I get to sleep I tend to sleep heavy to the point I struggle to wake up, like I'll just sleep through alarms, but I do have those constantly waking nights sometimes. I had a fucking exhausting day, left at 10am and got home at 1am so why am I not able sleep? It is now 5am and I can't fucking sleep. I cannot relax, feel constantly anxious and stressed, I'm constantly thinking about how much emotional pain I'm in and run plans through my head of how I'm going to kill myself. My brain just rapidly jumps through endless thoughts and won't fucking turn off. My body and especially my eyelids feel exhausted but my brain just won't stop.
Signal	I know benadryl isn't addictive enough to call quitting necessarily "cold turkey" but ive read about the potential for 50% increase in dementiahad a runny nose at work the other day and was told i cant be back at work for 6 days. im thinking since i've taken benadryl every night for a month if i quit now i may have some sleepless nights for the next few days but in my opinion its better to have no sleep and not have to go to work than vice versa. anybody have trouble sleeping after quitting benadryl? and for how long? i plan on taking melatonin.
Signal	Never posted on this subreddit, but have been an insomniac since pre-teen years (& before that, used to sleepwalk as a kid). I’ve tried everything to regulate my sleep schedule, but at this point try to just roll with it. Anyone else feel like they inherently just understand the phrase “it’s always 3am?”
Signal	HiIf anyone have this or knows about it, please commentSo, in general it's hard for me to sleep at night even if I am tired and feels the needing to sleep, and keeps rolling on the bed trying to sleep for one or two hours, And I feel my body just won't cool down, the warmth of it keeps me up.But it's way easier for me to sleep at daytime, and I feel more comfortable, even if I slept for a good period of time last night
NotSignal	Trying to gauge out there how many hours those of us with sleeping problems end up getting on average every night
NotSignal	Is it annoying? Yes. Will I be disjointed for the rest of the day and suffering from heart palpitations due to sleep deprivation and drinking way too much coffee? Also yes. But damn, I love sunrises. The way that the diffused light hits everything is beautiful. It brings me back when I was a kid and woke up early enough to wander around the sleeping house by myself and wait, just listening to birds and looking outside, waiting until eight when cartoon network started. Or when I would go camping with my grandparents and my cousins and I'd wake up to the sound of my grandfather setting up the camp stove for breakfast, campfire smoke weaving through the mist. The air was still cold and almost nippy, but everything seemed to nearly glow as the sun came up. I really, really miss it.I'm not an early riser, I wish I was, maybe I'll be able to do it some day, but for now I'm just gonna wait through the night.
Signal	i’m under 18, i have distress with falling asleep rather than staying asleep (i get anxious with just the though of trying to fall asleep). melatonin isn’t strong enough, anyone know something stronger that knocks you out quick ??
Signal	Hey. I've experimented with various natural supplements (to no avail), and have been on multiple prescription medications (the side-effects weren't kind) for insomnia and anxiety. I'm curious about CBD products, and wonder if anyone here has benefited from them. If so, could you share the particular product you use, as I'm a bit overwhelmed by the selection.
Signal	:(I tried melatonin,HTP5 and a bunch of unknown meds that local pharmacies offer. But I still can’t zz! I still have a fre months to go back to my country and get strong pills. (Now I am in a country that only sells sleeping aids and my grandma’s meds are even weak for her!How can I sleep?? I just ditched melatonin... I don’t drink coffee or anything and I workout everyday!
Signal	So, the latest attempt by my psychiatrist is Trazodone. I’m looking forward to it but I’m also a bit scared particularly with the danger of it causing priapism. Anyone have stories about their usage of this drug?
NotSignal	I have recently come off of sertraline/lustral (50mg) after 8 months, followed by lexapro (5mg) for a week and I have the itchiest skin I’ve ever had. I wake up constantly throughout the night, almost every hour and then can’t go back to sleep because of the itching. I am currently sleeping for about 4 hours a night. Does anyone have any advice?So far I’ve tried; - not using my phone two hours before bed- no caffeine after 3 pm - bedtime yoga - magnesium citrate before bed - Passion flower extract before bed
Signal	Have to get up for class in an hour went to bed about 2 hours ago. Getting really tired of people telling me to try cbd, or mediation or what ever they think would help me like I haven’t tried every possible thing. I don’t even know what to do at this point I have serious sleeping issues and it’s driving me crazy. Don’t know what to do at this point I’m getting really sick of laying awake all night.
NotSignal	Hi. How are you?Please feel free to potter around. Are you hungry?We make the best Monte cristos in town.........
Signal	I’ve had struggles sleeping since last September (sleeping 2 hours a day) for weeks and staying up twice for more than 24 hours in a month but now I’ve been getting good sleep since 2 months! Which is amazing .. I’m usually asleep after 1 hour,sometimes less..and I usually get 5-7 hours of sleep a day normally but if I can’t sleep at all I barely pass the 2 hours.. here’s the thing.. it’s been about 5 months since I’ve been up for more than 24 hours.. and I think it will happen again today! I have a big family dinner in about 4 hours and I just can’t sleep! Because the time I’m supposed to sleep is the time I’ll have to be getting ready! Which is why I’m so nervous of having to deal with all the panic and nervousness, shortness of breath, headaches etc I had the before 5 months! I’m totally scared! I always tell myself it’s just a day but what if I stopped sleeping for another day and the cycle repeats! I need comfort :(
Signal	been taking benadryl for about a year and a half now every night. maybe even two years, i don't remember.i would take 2-4 tablets a night at 25mg each. sometimes another round of 2 more tablets after waking up in the middle of the night. last night i only took one. woke up didn't take any more. been up since 1am, almost 5am now. got work soon, 9-5.shit sucksdon't like how benadryl has been making me feel lately. been abusing it far too much due to my depression and insomnia.just feels like nothing will ever get better, the universe is fixated on making my life miserable... just have to endure all my punishments, i have no other option because i'm a coward who could never commit suicide.
NotSignal	Well I drank one 4 loko and was finally able to get one measly hour of sleep. I just can’t feel asleep, I have tons of energy even though I’m not on any drugs. I’m starting to feel extremely paranoid. I no longer am hungry, all I feel is anger completely brain dead. Everyone is kind of sounding the same to me and when I read these Reddit posts a lot of them seem to sound like a lot of the same people. I wonder why that is. It’s probably because society is brainwashing people into buying Into the same Line of thinking as everyone else and always has been
NotSignal	Hi, I’ve been having issues sleeping and I thought this is the best subreddit to ask for help in, if not please redirect me to the appropriate subreddit.So I have Somniphobia (fear of sleeping) and I believe that it comes from a sleeping problem I have.Whenever it’s dark and I’m trying to sleep, as soon a I close my eyes, I start seeing disturbing figures and images, forcing me to keep my eyes open. But when I stare at something in the dark, I start hallucinating the same disturbing figures and images and it’s an on going cycle that prevents me from sleeping. Unless I turn on the light, I can’t sleep. I don’t freeze, so I’m thinking it might not be sleep paralysis so please help me figure it out. They’re not nightmares, as you need to dream to have them, and to dream you need to sleep, which I can’t.Thank you

Signal	What can you advise me to do? I just lay on my bed try to calm my mind but tht just wouldn't work on me. No matter how tried myself to fall asleep or calm my body. I just can't. I just want to sleep, I'm tired of it. 😭

NotSignal	Ive been experiencing insomnia for a while, but found that meditation helped me. I started a channel with some meditation music. Hopefully it may help you. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW4sG\_qobuSfdJxfk88InwQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW4sG_qobuSfdJxfk88InwQ)
Signal	My therapist suggests that certain rituals/habits can help better log off from the day - like turning off all screens an hour before bed, dim lights, breathing techniques, writing. I'm looking for anyone who knows from experience the things that work for them. Progressive muscle relaxation tips/techniques also welcome! Honestly, anything that helps. Context: I have Clinical Primary Insomnia, diagnosed.
Signal	It seems like every time I drink booze, it puts me to sleep fast, but then a few hours later I wake up, sometimes with my heart racing and unable to fall back asleep for hours at times. Last night I kept waking up and it took me a while to fall back asleep. The second time I woke up it took like 2 hours, and now my eyes feel like they are burning and tired. Does anyone else experience this with alcohol and sleep?
NotSignal	My boyfriend never sleeps. And when he does it’s from the terrible hours of 7-8:30 am til 2/3:30 pm. I use to not mind as much but it has gotten worse/ back to how he used to be. I don’t think it’s healthy as sometimes he can’t fall asleep and just stays up till the next night. Also his diet is messed up because he won’t eat for hours after he just wakes up from his morning naps. I wouldn’t say he’s depressed (I may not know though) perhaps just bored and lots of energy from not working right now... I guess what I’m saying/asking here is how can I get him to sleep, fix his schedule. I feel like a mom getting upset that he stays up all night but I hate waking up in the middle of the middle of night to find him on his phone . He will pretend to be asleep until I fall asleep and then hop back on his phone soon after, I feel like he doesn’t try hard enough to sleep? I use to stay up overthinking all the time growing up causing me to hate school and be a grumpy person, but I did everything to ty and fall asleep and eventually found a method. he says he tries by jut can’t how can I help him Better his sleep? Or is this a doctor thing? Am I being mean
NotSignal	It’s horrible. I pee and then 10 minutes later have to pee again. Not a little, a lot, and urgently enough that it’s hard to hold it. I don’t even know where it’s coming from- I don’t drink much water or liquid in general. It makes my commute and my work day very challenging. Anyone else experience this?
NotSignal	Normally if I have troubles sleeping, its resolved fairly easily, but just last night, I was unable to sleep and I am still awake. I experience fatigue and yawning, but no matter what I cannot sleep. I tried watching videos, music, tea, (only thing I haven't tried is medicine) and im starting to panic REALLY bad. Is something wrong with me?
NotSignal	Does anyone here suffer from RLS? It’s a huge contributing factor to my insomnia. Often I hear people and even doctors scoff at RLS, but it’s an absolute nightmare. How do you get relief from this????
NotSignal	I haven't been medically diagnosed with insomnia or anything, but i don't want to see a doctor about it because i know my parents will refuse and blame my erratic sleep patterns on something else like my phone. This has been going on for a month and a half now, it started off with me waking up during the night due to terrible allergies (hay-fever is a bitch) but after the season where i get my allergies passed i still found myself waking up at like 2 to 4 am and just not being able sleep. Before schools re opened this was somewhat okay because i would fall back asleep at around 7 to 8 but now that schools have re opened i cant go back to sleep. I've been running of 4 to 5 hours of sleep for the last two weeks or so, sometimes sleeping less than that or occasionally sleeping an entire night. I get terrible headaches through the day, my eyes are dry and itchy, i cant process information as well as i could and whenever i try to read something it blurs out after a few seconds. I've been falling asleep in the middle of my lessons at school for the last few days and its awfully embarrassing. I don't know what could possibly have caused my sleep to be so shit, i don't have caffeine anymore, go for 6 km sprints 4 hours before sleeping in hopes of burning myself out, and have always had healthy sleeping patterns throughout my life. Id really appreciate it if any of you had advice...
NotSignal	Hey all! I've been struggling with insomnia for about 1.5 years now, and have been trying the CBTi techniques for about 4 months. Haven't been able to stay consistent with the sleep restriction phase, but am now so motivated and am staying as consistent as possible. I previously had a sleep windown set for 6 hours, which worked, but now I cant fall asleep until much later. I recently moved my window down to 5.5 hours, but even still, I'm only averaging about 4 -4.5 hours per night. Been trying the 5.5 hours for a few days. It's so frustrating!!! I hear that I shouldn't limit my time to less than 5.5 hours.... but my sleep efficiency is not improving.. should I just give it more time, or go ahead and limit my sleep window further?
NotSignal	I can’t sleep. I went to bed in a bad mood but I thought it out and I’m fine now, yet I’m still unable to sleep. My heart is pounding, my eyes are heavy, my stomach hurts, and my head feels weird yet I don’t feel that tired. I don’t know what I should do. I went to bed at 2am and just laid there until 4am when i decided to listen to a Silent Hill let’s play which actually helped me fall asleep in the past on nights like this, but it’s not doing shit now and I’m scared I’m gonna die or something. I have no idea what the cause could be bc the day was completely normal and I didn’t do anything different. I’m 16 btw. Please help me.
Signal	Hello reddit! Coming to this fellow community forSome tips/advice about my recent sleeping problem I’m having. I don’t think I have insomnia, My sleep schedule is the so so, sometimes I go to sleep around 10 pm up until 1-2 am if I don’t have work the next day and I’m not tired. But recently I’ve been having the issue of not being able to sleep at night on days that I have work early at 5:30 am. I have no issue falling asleep, usually around 10 pm, but then I always wake up around 12-1 am and absolutely can not go to sleep after. I’m not sure what it is, I don’t feel anxiety about my job or working early, but it’s like I’m woken up and All my sleepiness is gone which leaves me tossing and turning all night till my alarm goes off at 4:30 am so I go into work on 2-3 hours of sleep which sucks. It’s like my thoughts won’t shut off, and it only happens when I know I have work early morning the next day. Other nights I’m usually okay on my sleep, if I do wake up, I can usually easily within minutes fall back to sleep. It’s starting to become very draining especially since I’m starting to open more.I have had anxiety and taken meds for a few years now but it’s not extreme or has ever kept me up at night.
NotSignal	I am a 28 year old make and I usually get around 6.5-8 hours of a sleep every day, but usually wake up 1-2 times a night to use the bathroom, so I question the quality of the sleep because of that alone. On top of that, during the week, I go to bed around 11 every day, but find it near impossible to wake up at the same time every day. That is because I can’t fit in time to go to the gym unless I wake up at 6 (2 days a week) opposed to 7 (3 days a week). On weekends, I will go to bed closer to 12 or 12:30 in the morning and wake up at 8. I also wake up multiple times during the night for no apparent reason sometimes. There are also nights where I literally don’t sleep at all. What the hell is wrong with me?
NotSignal	For the past week I'm having trouble sleeping. It takes me 1,5-2 hours before I can fall asleep. The problem is also that I wake up two hours after and again have problem sleeping.I sleep late around 3-4 am but my sleep pattern has always been like this. Nothing has changed. I don't understand why this happens now?
NotSignal	I began last week taking 200-300 mg of magnesium per day after seeing a post in this sub about it. I have noticed a marked improvement in being able to stay asleep longer periods through the night. Not only that, I have been having a calmer feeling in the evening, and feeling naturally tired instead of having that rush of energy late at night. My bottle reads 'Magnesium Citrate'. I don't in any way think it's a placebo effect. The difference is real.
NotSignal	So I woke up at 7.30am on Tuesday 12th May and then went into bed that night at like 10.30pm and was tossing and turning til around 1.30am so had a ciggy then went back up tried multiple steps in order to try and fall asleep. Tensing parts of body then relaxing. The military method. The 4-7-8 method none of them worked. Just laid in bed with eyes closed looked back at phone it was 3.Look back later 4.30amAnd again at 6am.Its now Thursday 14th May (1.25am UK GMT 0)
Signal	This is the second night where I can’t sleep because of hypnic jerks. I do not drink. Is this a mental block?
NotSignal	I did a home sleep study and they found mostly nothing (9 or fewer apneas and hypopneas for mild osa on my back).But ever since pandemic I have been in constant panic mode as I have been at home and away from public scrutiny. Constantly scrolling through phone to figure out ways out of my mountains of debt and trying to figure out ways to sleep and rest better so I can do better in my job and keep it.I had a very traumatic work experience 4 or 5 years ago that I never really fully got past and I think it keeps haunting me a bit and makes me stay into my own life and worries about work that I don't really feel capable of doing anything else and it's frustrating.I feel like its causing my sleep problems as recently taking CBD has been improving it. Anyone have any other stress relieving ideas?
Signal	(Mostly venting, sorry this is very long) (Kinda long TLDR at the bottom.) It will soon be a week since it has started and I am starting to worry a lot. Until Tuesday night, I’ve always had perfect nights of sleep, which means ; I had no problems to go to sleep at night. I used to normally go to sleep between 9:30 and 10:00 PM and I would sometimes wake up to go pee 2-3 times per night, but I could also easily go back to sleep. I would wake up around 6:30 or 7:00 AM but I didn’t mind. Since Wednesday, all I can think about is “Will I be able to sleep tonight”. It gives me so much anxiety that I don’t give much thoughts about important stuff like college and homeworks anymore. Also, I can barely concentrate at school. When the sun goes down, I start to worry more and more. My stomach hurts and i’m only thinking of ways to make me stop thinking about it and enjoy my evenings. (I should also add that i’ll be tired the whole evening) When I decide to go to sleep, my whole body is shaking and suddenly I am not tired anymore. I try to not overthink any of this, but I can’t. Which leads me to this : => Because I can’t fall asleep naturally anymore, I’ve started to steel some of my father’s pills that are made to help you sleep. They’ve helped me for 3 days straight. But, because those pills are very addictive, yesterday, I bought melathonine that I used last night, hoping I would get the same effects from the pills that I have slolen. However, last night, I woke up at 1:30 AM from a very light sleep. I couldn’t go back to sleep, I was too anxious so, I went back to my father’s pills. ._. This morning, I woke up crying and praying (even though i’m atheist) that this would be fixed soon. The thing is : I know exactly what triggered this but I don’t know how to get rid of it. My anxiety disorder makes me overthink anything. I’m hoping to be able to get a therapist or something like that very soon. If you’ve come this far, thank you!! TL;DR : Since Wednesday, I have an irrational fear of not being able to sleep, I know that If did not think about it, I would probably be able to sleep. As a result, It affects my every day life. I’ve only been able to sleep with the help of my father’s pills (which are made to make you sleep) I know what triggered it but I can’t make it stop.
NotSignal	I want to talk about this topic with people who have similar issues, see how common it is, and other’s takes on it.*First thought that came to my head*, is the entire way I perceive time, Time overall has an entirely different meaning to me than to others. I’ve observed this via living with one person who doesn’t have any issues sleeping at all. Overall, I don’t have a natural body timer- and would have no perception of time if I were in a dark room with no clock. Most people crave food when they wake up, around lunch, and dinner. People subconsciously have a schedule set. Subconsciously do stuff I just don’t do. Most people revolve their life around that schedule, and it’s so obscure to me. Not impossible to replicate without sleeping at night, but still feels off.I couldn’t explain my typical day because my days just last longer (logically, I stay up 2+ days regularly) and time just becomes this giant mud puddle.(A strange example: I told someone I was on my 9th water bottle. They had no context so we’re concerned because that’s a lot of fucking water lol. I had to explain that “yes, I’m on my 9th bottle of water, but I’ve been awake for 45 hours.” It baffled them. (Again, logically- not every day you hear that) )That’s my ramble-y take on just one aspect that changes for insomniacs. Another thing that I’m recalling, Insomnia and school is a horrible, draining mixture when you just live like this. I remember being miserable in school, and teachers would look too far into my home life because of my insomnia. I would skate 3 miles there and back multiple times to attend without sleeping due to just having extended days. I’d explain this and teachers would consider reporting it. Any current students going through the same shit?*This is a rather open post/thread, I want to hear what your lives are like with insomnia, what’s your differences among your peers. Any backhanded advantages of sleeping disorder? (like having a lot of extra time) or something that makes you miserable? Relate to what I mentioned above? Let’s chat about it.
NotSignal	I'm trying to get through it now. This shit causes major insomnia!!! If anyone else is going through this, has any advice, or just wants to talk, let me know
NotSignal	im 16. today I went to sleep at 23, couldn't sleep until 4 and every hour made me more angry with myself to the point where I had a panic attack (I don't know how to call it) I started heavily breathing and my heart started to beat super fast, I started crying I punched my head trying to knock me out I ripped my pants in tears and I almost suffocated myself hoping that my mental stress would go away. fortunately I could understand that I was being a retard and washed my face with freezing water and I went to sleep with my mother (I still can't sleep but I feel much better). I don't want those emotions to never come back and I want a solution to my insomnia (I barely sleep every night it started a week ago) please someone tell me what to do and please don't think that I'm a troll or somethingedit : I forgot to say that I haven't slept in 2 days literally 0 hours
NotSignal	sometimes when i try to sleep my brain just starts thinking of the worst possible things. death, car accidents, intruders, gore, ghosts, creatures, and the likes. i can’t ever manage to think of anything else for some reason. even if i form another story in my head to distract myself it always ends up in the same place. this always causes me to get out of bed and just search the house and make sure the doors locked and stuff. how do i help myself? am i going crazy
Signal	So I have had insomnia symptoms for the past 8 months, and I’ve tried everything from water to warm milk and still can’t sleep so I have to tire myself on my phone, I still live with my parents and I’m under 18 (won’t specify how old for my privacy) so they give me a bedtime of about 12 AM or 10 PM depending on the times, is there anything else that I could try to get to sleep?
Signal	I used to struggle to sleep more than four hours at a time (often during the day). For the last four years or so, however, I’ve been lucky to get literally 12 hours over the course of a week. It’s in 2-4 hour blocks a few times a week. Every week I’m awake for days straight. I’ve been awake since Sunday morning when I slept from 7am-9am.I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist and therapists (cbt I and psychotherapy for years) since I was a teenager for depression, anxiety, insomnia and some other stuff. The depression and anxiety have been well-treated for years now.I do all the CBT I stuff. No napping, up and down at the same time every day, light therapy, meditation (a lot of it), eating at regular times, no caffeine, low sugar and carbs, exercise in the morning. I’ve been on and off various medications. Seroquel was the only one that worked regularly. Not every night, but most. I gained a bunch of weight on it and I’m genetically predisposed to diabetes so I reluctantly came off it after a couple of years in August. I’m absolutely at the end of my rope. I’m in a demanding graduate program for which I require proper use of my mental faculties and I’m doing well in the program but my state of mind is garbage. My health and household are taking the brunt of the damage and I’m just so completely over this. Nothing works. Most days I wear my mental illness badge with pride and work through the fatigue with a smile and a gregarious nature. But I am out of cope. I have nothing left. I want to go to a fucking hospital and say please just help me but I know they’ll say hmmm you need to see a psychiatrist or therapist and send me home. I want to call out of work and wallow in bed for a mental health day but I’m so fucking sick of working my ass off to follow the sleep hygiene rules and just working my ass off AT WORK and getting nothing but less sleep and more mental health days. I’m just screaming into the void but any words or kindness, encouragement, or advice would be awesome.
Signal	Keep on waking up at random times.24 M. During the last 6 months I can't remember when I had a continuous 8 hour sleep.. No matter how hard I exercise the previous day, I still wake up randomly around 4-5 AM and UNABLE to resume sleep. This is fucking up my energy levels the next day. My blood glucose levels are alright.
NotSignal	I’m someone who needs 8 hours a night to feel rested the next day. Once upon a time I could easily sleep that long, but it seems like the past couple months, I wake up after 5-6 hours automatically, and have a hard time going back to sleep. I’m going through the day feeling sleep deprived, and I can barely remember the last time I slept 8 hours. Could stress be causing this? I’m unemployed and about to move across country. The only thing that seems to sometimes help is taking promethazine, which can knock me out. But I don’t want to rely on meds. I’m 39F.
NotSignal	I’ve been having trouble to sleep last week and I could only get about 4 hours of sleep per night. After lots of prayers ( I’m Christian), this week, I’ve been getting 8 to 10hours of sleep.Prayers really works and Jesus exists!Good luck guys!
NotSignal	Just ranting here... My 4 year year old son has Autism. He's non verbal. Very intelligent in other ways though. We have the same sleep schedule... go to sleep around 11pm, sleep for 2-3 hours and then stay up until 8am or so and grab a couple more hours a sleep. Sometimes I have to continue to stay up and not get those extra hours because of work. What I'm tired of is the shitty advice I have to listen to every day. "You should try chamomile tea" "Melatonin pills are good for sleep".Um, thanks. I'm 38 years old. Had sleep issues my entire life. Apparently my son does too. I'm ok with it. Just let me be a little groggy, I still work my butt off.I know it comes from a good place, but it's frustrating listening to people who just have no idea what it's like to have real insomnia.
NotSignal	It’s 11AM and I still haven’t slept (last night) so I guess that’s today’s sleep forgotten about lmao I love life
NotSignal	It feels worse when you’re high on all these antidepressants and melatonin and supplements. They just make you feel horrible if you’re too anxious to go to sleep.
Signal	Hope my experience helps others plan. 47 year old male, 180 pounds, was on 100 Mg of Trazodone daily for 1 year for insomnia. I dropped 25 Mg every 2 weeks until it was done. With each drop, almost 36 hours from the first night of a lower dosage I would hit this windows of about 2-3 hours that I felt really strange. Hard to explain but felt a little bit like out of body experience. It wasn't bad though and I felt if I was driving or had to interact at work I could have gotten through it fine but I wanted to make note of it. The first 7 days of each taper had a couple of short feelings of discomfort but nothing I would change plans over. The 2nd 7 days was almost symptom free and just used as buffer for the upcoming taper. Never felt physically sick, or zaps. The good part of the tapering though was the wonderful feelings of clarity that came on at random that remind you what it feels like to be getting it out of your system. I had worked myself up that tapering off the Trazadone was going to be scary or problematic but it really wasn't a big deal and each drop went a little easier than the last. Going from 25 to 0 was almost nothing.
NotSignal	I feel like using them to get deeper sleep. What are your experiences with Ambien?
NotSignal	Tossing and turning all night long. Trying to get up and do relaxing things but not working either. Gotta love insomnia!
Signal	Indianapolis insomniac checking in here, and I’m at the point where I’m looking for a sleep clinic or for a good sleep doctor. I’ve tried trazadone for sleep, which can help me stay asleep but not fall asleep. For a myriad of reasons I’m looking for a clinic/doctor, but I’d like to hear about your experience first. Thanks!
Signal	i haven't been sleeping well recently (officially diagnosed with situational insomnia) probably about 5 hours a night and went to my general practitioner today and she prescribed me 50mg of trazodone. anyone have experience with it?
NotSignal	I been sleeping good for the past week .. the other night and last night is like every 3 hours waking up ... I have a flight ✈️ tomorrow maybe is that idk
Signal	Anyone else panicking when trying to sleep and getting adrenaline rushes because you are about to loose conciouseness (fall asleep) ? Its really really bad for me. Every night i lay until im fully burnt out and fall asleep without noticing
Signal	For the whole time of quarantine, I've had a weird sleep schedule (waking up at 12 am, sleeping at 12pm or later) and it didn't really bother me. What's bothers me now is that I've been trying to fix it, I've been sleeping at 4 am BUT I KEEP WAKING UP AT 7 AM. My body thinks it's a nap (??) Today was by far the worst since I slept at 4 am, woke up at 7 am, was able to only sleep again at 9 am (with a melatonin pill), and WOKE UP AT 9 PM. What can I do to fix this? Should I just take two melatonin pills and see what happens? PS. our rooms here are blackout; i don't really have natural light in my room so it doesn't really affect much i think
NotSignal	So basically the title describes my situation and it would be interesting to know about your thoughts/experiences.
Signal	Hi guys,Over the last year or so I've developed really extreme insomnia. These days it's rare for me to get more than 6 hours sleep on any given night, and I probably average about 4 hours a night most days.Sometimes though I will go days without any sleep. This has been going on for about a year now but has been getting more frequent lately.It's 7.30am currently and I haven't slept this evening and this will now be my third day with no sleep and I'm not tired at all. I am absolutely exhausted though and I have an awful headache, but I have so much energy it's like I've downed 5 cans of red bull or something.Anyway, reason for posting here is that I assume this isn't healthy. Doctors have given me meds but they don't seem to work. They just make me feel weird. Like they zone me out and make it hard for me to concentrate but they don't help me sleep. Am I going to die if this continues? I'm 29 so I'm pretty young but it's been hard this year living like this and it's worrying me that it's getting worse all the time.I've always been a bit of a night owl but I think my sleep routine this last couple of years may have caused this. I spent the last couple of years over working myself and I really haven't prioritised sleep much at all. I often forced by body to deal with 5 hours when it wanted more and now it's just given up telling me it wants sleep. Is this something that can happen? I used to get so little sleep I'd start falling asleep at work, and a few times I actually have. I'd have to jog to the toilet or something to wake me back up. But these days my body just doesn't care. I feel exhausted, but I don't need to sleep anymore. I haven't felt tired for months.I'll try again tomorrow night. It sucks feeling physically sick all the time but I do quite like all the energy I get. It's like being high and ultra alert while also being completely exhausted.
Signal	I don't usually have insomnia in all honesty, but recently it's becoming more and more frequent that I can't fall asleep until 4 am and then I'm a zombie at work running on 3 or less hours of sleep every day. I've got really bad anxiety that causes it, and of course it loves to rear it's ugly head at night.So far I've tried grounding exercises, mindful breathing and body scanning, and even counting sheep. Nothing's working anymore. Any tips on what to do next?
NotSignal	I am posting here because the r/sexsomnia is not longer active and I can't post there for some reason. Sexsomnia is a sleepp disorder that effects 11% of men with sleep disorders and 4% of women with sleep disorders. It is a farely new disorder first being studied and diagnosed in the 80s. The symptoms are engaging in sexual acts (grinding, meaning, groaning, masturbation, and sexual intercourse) while in NREM sleep. It is similar to sleep walking/talking. I have it. Didn't know sexsomnia was even a thing till this week. I got my GF pregant over a year ago while sleeping and now we have a beautiful baby boy. Here is where it gets tricky. We split while she was 5 months pregnant. Soon I will be getting a paternity test and going to court for child custody if he is in fact mine. I do not believe i should be liable as i was unable to give consent during the sexual act that created the child. Nor did I give my good graces when she decided to keep it. Since he was born I have been more than willing to take responsibility for my son. Any cases I look up that involve sexsomnia all have different results. So I am kinda in the dark here. I will be attending a sleep study to get an actual diagnosis and hopefully the court will see i have a condition where sometimes I may initiate sex in my sleep and am unable to give consent. Dont know what that will mean for custody and child support but I will keep you guys posted as my case goes further:)
NotSignal	I have been on Zyprexa for about five years but it’s really a horrible med and my doctor said it may turn me into a drooler. So I stopped taking it and the withdrawals are worse than what I went through quitting drinking and cocaine. Has anyone successfully managed to come off of it and still get restful sleep. It’s been two weeks now and I’m nauseated, have diarrhea every day, and nothing gets me to sleep. I’m going to try smoking up but this has been pure hell.
NotSignal	I haven’t slept in three weeks with one slumber not staying asleep but for about 1 hour. Twice I remember this week so we will go with 4 hours of sleep just Incase I cheated a little while. Someone please help me please!!!!!!!!! I’m damn near starting to lose touch with reality because my brain is probably in shambles. This is the worst thing in the world. Sleep=HEALTH. It’s amazing how much not getting sleep can fuck with you. Am I fucking dying? 👈🏼 (Literally?) Someone help.
Signal	This is just a rant. It's 1:50 of a fucking tuesday, I have to wake up at six and work all day and I can't fucking sleep. I'm usually very productive when I can't sleep, but lately I haven't been able to do nothing more than looking at the fucking walls. Kinda of tired of the hole work, university, adult life thing and it's just starting. Any tips of now making things more exciting and less manic?
NotSignal	Meaning that you won't have to do it for the rest of your life? I am clarifying because in this sub I see the word " cure " being used wrongly for some reason
Signal	First post here, hoping someone has insights into how to assist with this.I've been experiencing sleep disturbances that are irregular - it doesnt happen all the time, usually for a few days, then it goes away, and comes back. I fall asleep - Im tired, and fall asleep quickly. About half an hour later, Im wide awake again, and begin feeling as if there are bugs crawling all over me. It gets so bad that I feel like somethings in my hair, biting my leg, etc, and I actually get a fright -- but there is never ANYTHING there. I usually cant get back to sleep for hours.I have a good, relaxing bedtime routine and (usually) regular sleep cycles. Ive looked into bed bugs - not an issue here - and its not mosquitos either.Does anyone else experience this? What have yoy done that has helped? TIA!
Signal	Thanks to reading suggestions in this sub, I was able to make myself relax enough to fall asleep pretty fast, usually it takes me an hour or more (and a lot of Benadryl)Last night, I took 250 mg of Magnesium 2 hours before bed. I also had a cup of Sleepytime Tea Extra, the kind with Valerian Root. I also had one glass of wine, but I’m not sure if that affected anything at all. I was super relaxed, usually I start getting anxious around bedtime because I’m worried about my insomnia, but last night I was fine. I took 20 mg of Melatonin, and 1 dose of Benadryl as well. I know it’s a lot of pills, but usually I’d have to take 2-2.5 doses of Benadryl to go to sleep, basically just knock myself out so I can get some sleep, so I see this as an improvement! Thankful for this sub’s advice. I’m hoping to get rid of the Benadryl completely and cut down on the Melatonin too. It’d be nice to not need so many pills just to go to sleep.
Signal	Itching only starts at night when I'm anxious. At first I thought it might be bed bugs, but after checking my mattress and washing everything, the itching persists. It's so bad, I've ended up creating rashes where I've compulsively scratched. Of course this all has to happen the night before a big day. Haven't been doing much for months due to the virus and of course the one night I need the sleep, it doesn't come. It really sucks getting anxious every night before bed. I'm tired of laying awake with nothing but my thoughts for hours on end every night. I'm not even anxious about the rest of my life anymore. Only thing I'm anxious about is falling asleep, but I guess that's enough to stop me from sleeping for more than 2 hours every night.
Signal	Soo like I went to sleep at 6am "last night" I woke up "next morning" and had too much energy for someone who.. had 1 hour of sleep...? As the day passed I started getting more tired and tired but i didn't feel it i just started yawning more. It was whatever. I had swim last period, went home put on my comfy clothes and at around 5:10-ish I started falling asleep and I was just like sure I'll have me a 1 hour nap or so it was a crazy day... I just woke up..... and it it currently 11:40pm ..... and so I hopelessly ask myself.... am I ever... going... to have a normal sleeping life...???? That's it.. I just thought I should share my experience lmfaoo
NotSignal	Seen a lot of calming essential oil vapes or just calming vapes with no nicotine in on my ads recently and was wondering if anyone had any experience and opinions?Thanks!
Signal	Common poster here unfortunately. I appreciate this community. My sleep has been bad, but has gotten significantly worse the last couple of months (3-5 hours), and I’m now only able to sleep at max 2 hours MAX with 1.25mg of Ativan and plan on switching back to Xanax tonight instead to see if that helps. My husband and I are trying every doctor and I even tried a behavioral health hospital which made things worse. Only sleeping 2 hours a night is hell. I can’t even nap (I’ve been trying so hard to).I hate bringing up SFI but my fear is dying this slow painful god awful death with no one recognizing it and as sick as I feel now from sleep deprivation I can’t imagine feeling worse. I’m not suicidal but this is so bad I’d be fine with dying. I’m convinced I have it at this point and can’t get a doctor to order a PET scan. Has anyone else gone through it this severe? I’m looking for hope because at this point I’m so convinced I have this.
Signal	I often find that I get strong suicidal thoughts and desire to self harm if I can’t get to sleep after several hours - is this resonantly common? I also get quite panicky/anxious as I begin to realise that I’m not going to get enough sleep and that my following day will be ruined. I sometimes take Zoplidem if I can’t sleep after 2+ hours, but I try and avoid prescription medication as much as possible.
Signal	I know of somebody who is on 3 days without sleep. Symptoms include: fatigue, antsy mood, agitation, mentally always awake, and has tried just about all remedies. As somebody who is close to her and cannot relate to what she is feeling and going through I feel helpless. I don't want to sound insensitive and make irrational judgments or give poor advice so I came here to ask you all what is a good place for her to start on the road to a normalized sleeping schedule. For context this has happened to her before, where she can't fall asleep for days at a time. I've tried my best to stay awake with her till the early hours of the morning but I myself couldn't function. Hoping for the best
Signal	Monday night: absolutely zero sleep. Tuesday: fell asleep early and got around 7 hours.Last night: barely any sleep at all. I think I got MAYBE 1.5-2 hours of sleep? But it felt like that weird light sleep. I know I had to have slept at least a bit cause I did have a weird dream. My bodies doing that weird thing where it apparently only wants to sleep every other night. Not sure why. For a couple months I was getting “better” and at least managing to sleep every night with an average of 4-5 hours, even if I got to sleep really late. I haven’t skipped nights in a long time. This is really bumming me out because I get very high anxiety when I’m sleep deprived or when I don’t sleep at all and it ruins my entire day. I also have two dates this weekend (I’m supposed to be going on a date tomorrow with this nice new fellow!) and I’m afraid of not sleeping and having to cancel or feeling like death on the date. 😩 I’m sad. and tired. and frustrated.
Signal	My insomnia manifests in different ways. I’m an extremely light sleeper and I recently moved in with my partner and sharing a bed with a mover and shaker in their sleep has come with its own set of challenges. I feel so frustrated tonight/this morning? What is time even. I feel tired most nights quite early, I know my body is yearning for sleep. I’ve tried and maintained a pretty good bed time routine, and for the most part it isn’t the falling asleep that’s the problem. It’s the staying asleep and getting anything more then 2hrs of what feels like legitimate rest. I’ve been overusing over the counter sleep aids that I feel as though my body as built some sort of tolerance to them. Does anyone else have an experience similar to this? I feel like I’ve tried it all. Even shamefully will admit I’ve abused gravol and nighttime cold meds during desperate times. I’m sure someone on here has taken too much melatonin before and felt the stomach ache that lets you know you’ve taken too much. Ugh. I’m not proud of this, but I feel at times this is an exhausting battle and my desperation is extreme. What I would give to be able to give my body and mind the rest it’s longing for. So glad to know there are others out there like me. Long time lurker of this sub, everyone’s posts have been so helpful and comforting during the long sleepless nights.
Signal	It all started because I had a lot of work, due to that I was able only to sleep for about 4 hours a day. Sometimes during the weekdays I'd sleep 2-3 hours max and then on Saturday I'd literally collapse and sleep all day(about 16-19 hours).Last year it got better, about 6 hours each day with no oversleeping during the weekends.The last 3 months have been terrible. To fall asleep it could take me from 10 minutes to 6 hours, without doing anything else. Simply staying in bed with eyes closed, trying not to think of anything.I'd usually sleep around 3 am and then I'd have to wake up at 6 to work.The dark circles under the eyes have become severely noticeable. And lately I'm not able to concentrate at what I'm doing.It really angers me that I'm not able to do my job sufficiently. And I don't know how long this is going to last.I do not drink coffee or tea. And I have a healthy diet.If anyone has any tips on how to sleep faster I would be very grateful. Thanks!
NotSignal	How do you handle leg/feet pain/soreness? we obviously recover much worse than people with "normal"sleep, for me i didnt sleep more than 2-6 hours for the past 4 months and sometimes specially my feet hurt, and my legs get sore and its soooo annoying, magnesium helps a little but its just so stupid i wake up after 6 hours of sleep ( when i get lucky, which is still nothing after 4 months of shit sleep), and 4 hours later im tired again :(&#x200B;Tried to make a routine, which helps a little, but i can't make up something which is challenging enough to tire my body and mind at the same time as uni.. hope you sleep well folks
NotSignal	But I close my eyes and thoughts start appearing and they become too much then I start feeling my chest getting tighter so I grab my phone to distract me. Rant over, I’ll close my eyes and try again
NotSignal	My first discovery of the word 'Insomnia' was not as it's TRUE meaning, I remember Insomnia being the name of one the biggest illegal rave scene events of the uk in the early 90's... If you had seen the state of some of the characters come crawling out of there.... well..It were more like 'Dance of the Dead' lol
Signal	I had trouble sleeping so i decided to play some pokemon. After a few hours of pokemon i decided to stop. When shutting the ds off i still hear the music but different tones. I have Anxiety and i already have help but... should i mention this or is this just a common thing when really sleepy? I’m kinda scared...
Signal	I don’t know how long this is going to last. The only time I’m able to sleep is for maximum an hour in the afternoon/evening.
NotSignal	Hey! I have bad anxiety and sleep issues and found a wonderful app called slumber. Is there anyway I can get premium for free?
NotSignal	So all my life until about 2 weeks ago I have never had issues falling asleep or staying asleep. I could sleep through just about anything.Now for the past two weeks, I have not had a single good night of rest. I usually fall asleep fine but I always wake up 2-4 times throughout the night. Usually, I fall back asleep easily but the disruptions are really messing up my sleep because I always feel tired and drained now. It's really fucking me up and I'm scared that I will have to deal with this the rest of my life. At first, I thought maybe it was because of my poor sleeping habits. Up until two weeks ago, I got an average of 5 hours of sleep per night, for over 6 months. I didn't have a steady sleep schedule either, I would wake up later and stay up later on days off. But if that was the issue I don't know why I wouldn't have developed insomnia much earlier? My next thought was maybe its stress, I have been VERY stressed on and off lately, but honestly, I have been really stressed on and off the past 6 months as well, and I've never had this issue before. I have had a bad night's sleep on a stressful day before but I always got better within a day. I think I have been more stressed consistently this past month or two, but why would I suddenly lose sleep now, and not be able to regain it lowering my stress for two weeks? Surely having low stress the past two weeks would have been enough time to get back on track?After the first 3 consecutive nights of bad sleep, I decided to fix my sleep schedule asap. I have adjusted my schedule so that I am sleeping around the same time every night and getting at least 7 hours of sleep, I also haven't been that stressed for most of the last two weeks (there was maybe one or two days last week that I was really stressed). I still wake up every single night though (1.5 weeks since adjusting my sleep schedule). I don't go to bed with thoughts racing or stressed or anything, I feel too tired to even feel that stressed.My only other thought is that maybe it is sleep apnea. I remember a few weeks or so ago while I was in the process of falling asleep I awoke with a slight feeling that I had not been breathing, but if I recall correctly, it only happened briefly a few times that one night BEFORE I had fallen asleep completely, and then I fell asleep and stayed asleep fine after that. I haven't really awoken with that feeling these past two weeks, I also don't think I've been snoring but I mean to record to test that. I did wake up one night with my mouth completely dry but it had been wide open, which has happened before in my life so it might not mean anything. I also woke up a few nights having to pee in the middle of the night, but I had drunk lots of water right before bed (which I don't normally do). I don't really fit the demographic for people most likely to have sleep apnea either, I'm a little underweight, female, and a small neck, no history of snoring ect. At this point, I don't know what to do. It seems to have randomly occurred and I can't afford to go to a doctor bc I have no health insurance and have no idea how expensive it would be for them to run tests on me out of pocket, but I'm assuming not affordable for me at all. If I had any idea what was causing it I could maybe fix it myself but I don't even know what's causing it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Signal	Hi! I'm 23F and in a lot of physical painI slept OK (3h) on Sunday morning but not since. (7am Sunday when I woke up, its now 5PM Monday)I was desperately trying to get a good sleep yesterday before a long trip. 8h driving.Anyway. I couldn't. At all. I was so scared I wouldn't be able to fall asleep/that I'll miss stuff for the trip that I couldn't fall asleep in the end.Now I'm in bed and my stomach hurts. I feel nauseous. Sick. Scared. My heart is pumping through my chest. I'm terrified of never being able to fall asleep again.In fact I'm scared of dying because of it.For more info, I have severe diagnosed depression, BPD and anxiety issues. My anxiety has always caused me disruptive sleep since I was 7. It comes and goes. Sometimes I'm good for months. Years. And then it hits back, worse and worse each time. 2020 has been a hell of a year and 70% of it was sleep issues. While usually, I get those problems maximum 10% of the time.Does anyone have any words to calm me? Any suggestions? I'll gladly take anything. I know it's all in my head. I do. But I can't do anything about it.
Signal	My doctor called it intermittent insomnia and was wondering about your guys experience if you have it. I was prescribed trazodone so we'll see where this goes.
NotSignal	I have been sleeping late for quite a while now. Its getting really bad. I need to do smthing about it. But i jst cant seem to sleep quick. Its always 3 or 4 am. What can i do to sleep early or do smthing somewhat effective. Its getting really annoying to not being able to sleep alright. And waking late
Signal	Honestly, I'm at wit's end here. I have no fucking idea what to do, or what's wrong. And I will probably get into the doctor to get a sleeping pill to help, but this issue still frustrates me, and even a sleeping pill will only fix the symptoms, but not the origin of the problem. So I really would love to know how any of this makes any fucking sense. So any help is appreciated.I get enough sleep, but I still have a terrible time *getting* to sleep. And it ebbs and flows, sometimes gets better, sometimes worse. And I'm in a worse period right now and I feel like I have tried everything I can (which isn't much tbh, but maybe others can give me more home remedies) short of actual sleeping pills. Basically I will lay down and be laying down for an hour until I finally fall asleep... Then 2 or 3 hours later, I wake up, feeling tired, but then have to lay down for basically another hour before I finally fall asleep, and THEN I finally get a good night's rest, of 8 or so hours. Which sure, at least I wake up fully well rested, but I don't know if it's worth the crying myself to sleep as this frustrates and stresses me out and just adds to my depression and feeling hopeless as if nothing I do matters to fixing things, especially as last night I went to drastic measures of forcing myself to stay up 22 hours, with no caffeine or sugar that day, yet this problem STILL happened... WHAT THE FUCK??? What else can I possibly do and again, I'm just so... perplexed by the fact I take so long to go to sleep only to wake up and take long to go to sleep again... and then finally I sleep perfectly for hours on end... How???It's honestly getting to the point where I'm just getting scared to sleep as I might end up well rested but I have to deal with so much stress between going to sleep, and that point, that I just wonder if it's even worth it. But I also don't wanna get up, still being tired, and have no energy to do anything. :(So thanks for anyone who read this wall of text and if you have any tips/help I'd love to hear it, I'm just so confused and frustrated and fuck...
Signal	Have been hit by tension headache entire night and even after taking pill, I can't sleep. I literally stayed in bed for an hour, not move an inch, and counted number 1 to 1000 three times yet still could not sleep. Now I will be low energy as fuck tomorrow.
Signal	I try not to take meds (benadryl/xanax) every night even though I usually won't sleep at all or very little off and on all night when I don't. Tried 30 mg of Restoril generic recently and it doesn't do a thing. I want to give my body a break from any meds several times a week. But when I go one night no sleeping, my body acts like I drank a thousand cups of coffee the next day and especially into the next night, even though I can tell my body is tired. Then I'll go a second night no sleep even worse.I used to never take anything and just was barely sleeping, so I gave in and started taking stuff to help because I learned how damaging not sleeping can be on the body and mind. I don't feel anxious or withdrawal when I don't take sleep meds...just hyper and have fun with my entertaining thoughts and random ideas. I've wondered if this could be a sign of some element of bipolar.
Signal	Been battling with acute insomnia for years, this past week has been one of the worse I've had I'm so tired that I can't sleep it's awful. Really feel for the people with chronic insomnia.
Signal	I know I need sleep and I know that I should be sleeping now but knowing that I'm not getting enough sleep keeps me awake because I know I can't fall asleep.I actually love sleeping in the day because it seems as if there's not much to worry about but I can't have that due to school and sleeping at night just brings a lot of fears.Ok, time to try and sleep.
Signal	I realize melatonin is a naturally occurring chemical and I shouldn’t be reacting as such. But just like clock work, only on the days when I take it, I wake up (weather it be in morning or middle of night) and I immediately have an ugly feeling. I feel wired and my ears ring. Kinda like I just took some sort of upper drug and it’s extremely hard to go back to sleep. Usually going back to sleep isn’t a huge issue for me, it’s just I totally falling into a deep sleep. I was curious to see if anyone else has a shared experience and what I can possibly do to help it or viable natural alternative. Btw- I take opiates and alprazolam at night. They are for chronic disorders. Neither puts me to sleep. I’m a bit worried about adding anything too “hard” to my regimen. That’s why I take melatonin
Signal	Well, it’s now been two weeks, and my rolling sleep average is coming in at around 3 hours per day. It’s probably only been a little higher than that for the last few months, with nights of rest coming on rare occasions. I’ve struggled with insomnia most of my life, but now that I’m without healthcare, I don’t have access to any meds that can help. In recent years, doctors are hesitant to prescribe anything that works. I’ve dropped out of school from it, multiple times, and have lost several jobs, but doctors still wont prescribe anything that is reliably effective. Nothing works. Quit caffeine? Lol, had no effect. Abstain from alcohol? Nope, doesn’t work either. Turning off screens, meditation, and other good sleep hygiene habits have no effect. I feel like my life might have turned out differently if I could sleep reliably, but it’s just not going to happen. I just started a new job a month ago, and now I’m going to get fired because I can’t sleep. Today, after all these weeks and months, I’m now having auditory hallucinations. It sounds like a bag of chips is repeatedly crinkling in the background, and my paranoia is getting out of hand. How do those of you with chronic insomnia manage to do anything with your lives? I cant progress beyond manual labor because I’m too exhausted to concentrate on acquiring credentials that would help me get ahead. Sometimes, I really hate this country. Why it’s so hard to be taken seriously and see a doctor is mind blowing to me. What a worthless society.
NotSignal	When I was younger I used to only catch 2hours of sleep but I wasn't tired, I think it's because it became a habit. Do you guys have similar experiences ?
Signal	So. Been in a lot of pain. I havent been sleeping properly for a month. Like literally my heart shoots out my chest and I wake up 5 times a night. I get rem sleep byt its not enoughI spoke with my doctor and I have been against medication for so long and literally tried all the otc sleep stuff and even cbd.I got addicted to benzos many years ago and I am very afraid to take zopiclone tonight.Is this enough of an emergency to take one tonight. I am literally delerious from lack of sleep and now arguing with people over what I think they mean when they talk to me. My memory is gone and I am a no sleep zombie.I am trying to find an answer to the underlying condition I have and I have to wait for specialists to see me.I'm afraid if take it tonight I will destroy and rem i have so if I don't take it tomorrow I will have no sleep instead of a little sleep.Please help
Signal	I wake up after 3 to 5 hours from sleeping. I do wake up feeling awake and energized but not for so long, I usually collapse by 3:00 PM and feel tired for the rest of the day.Here are the things I do to improve my sleep, with little to no improvement:1) No mobile phone screen two hours before bedtime.2) I make sure my skin gets exposed to sunlight during the day for at least 5 minutes.3) Ensure my bedroom is dark and silent on sleeping time.4) Zero sugar and zero caffeine during the day, sugar has some exceptions every once in a while.5) Vitamin D and magnesium pills an hour before bedtime.6) light, healthy and early dinner, no food 3 hours before bedtime.7) Fixed bedtime, even on weekends.8) I do sports 5 days a week, I even hit the swimming pool at 7:00 AM before going to work.And yet, I’m only sleeping for 3 to 5 hours a day, I miss the times when I slept for 6+ hours. I know things are worse for many of you here but I’m really doing a hard job trying to fix this and I’d appreciate any piece of advice.
Signal	31F, have always had problems sleeping, ever since I was little. I had been taking unisom (doxylamine succinate, not diphenhydramine) nightly for sleep for several months as I used it during almost my entire pregnancy with no issues at all. However, it recently began to lose effectiveness and I started taking melatonin along with it. I have a 5 month old who wakes up twice at night to feed so I would get into bed around 8-9 and take one 3mg melatonin and half of a unison (unsure of the dose, I tossed the bottle because it was empty). When baby would wake up to feed around 11:30-midnight, I would feed him, then take a whole unisom and sometimes another 3mg melatonin. This would keep me asleep until about 8am.Then I began taking one whole unisom and one melatonin at bedtime. When baby would wake me up, I would take maybe another 2 unisom and another melatonin. If I woke up after that because of my husband or needing to go to the bathroom, I would take 2 more melatonin. I even began adding benadryl on top of everything. Sometimes 25mg, but I worked my way up to 75mg. (One night this week, I believe it was Tuesday night, I took 10 melatonin (30mg), 3 Alteril (4mg melatonin, l-tryptophan, and valerian root but I'm not sure of the dosages on those), and 4 benadryl. I did not sleep.)However, very suddenly, everything stopped working. Monday night I went to sleep around 8:30, baby woke me up at 11:30, and then I was not able to get back to sleep. I was awake for nearly 48 hours straight. It didn't matter what I did, what I took, how much of it I took, I could not get back to sleep for anything. I was losing my mind, I felt like I was dying. My heart rate increased significantly. I could not control my breathing, I felt as though I was "manually" breathing and if I felt myself drifting, I would stop breathing and then wake myself up (I do not normally suffer from sleep apnea). I could not eat, and if I forced myself to try to eat, I would get sick. I dropped 8lbs in 2 days. I considered calling 911, I even called the emergency room at the local hospital and they told me they couldn't tell me what they could do for me unless I came in and saw a doctor.I have anxiety and depression, currently only treated via counseling, and my disorders obviously worsen with lack of sleep. My anxiety ramped up so much that part of the reason I could not sleep is because I was worried that if I got into bed, I would not be able to sleep. I used to experience "bed dread" because I was worried about not sleeping or getting back to sleep after waking to feed baby, but had gotten over it until this happened.I finally called my OBGYN as he is a medical doctor and is able to prescribe medication that doesn't just deal with female health or pregnancy. He prescribed me trazodone since I had taken it before, at 150mg once a night which is what I was taking before. I took it the night that I picked it up after I fed baby, Wednesday night, and took 2 hours to get to sleep. I woke up an hour later. And took another hour to get back to sleep, only to wake up in another hour. Process repeated until I finally got out of bed at 9am and decided I just wasn't going to get the sleep I needed.I called my doctor yesterday and told him the trazodone was still not working so he prescribed generic restoril in place of the trazodone. But because I was already having issues with shallow breathing, I decided to not take it and instead took the trazodone. I ended up taking one pill after I fed baby at 10, fell asleep in about half an hour, but then woke up at midnight. Took a half of a pill, took about 20 min to fall asleep, woke up at 1. Back to sleep, woke up a quarter til 3. Took another hour to get back to sleep, woke up at 5, took another half pill, and then more of the sleep/wake until I was just done around 8:30AM. Of course now I have that extreme hangover feeling, which I'd forgotten all about, and taking care of my kid is proving difficult.The doctor also recommended I go to a sleep clinic, but he said that is is a 3 night stay. I can't do that because my husband works during the day and can't be expected to take care of our son the entire day. He also needs to be able to sleep at night. We are 5 hours away from family and friends so no one could watch our kid if I did the clinic.&#x200B;I guess I'm just looking for advice or stories if anyone has experienced anything similar. I think I got to a point where my brain just stopped producing melatonin because I was providing it with so much external melatonin. I tried to look up how long it takes for the brain to begin producing it again but couldn't find much.
Signal	It’s currently 4:35am, so I’m expecting an all-nighter. Though I have been going to bed really late, I haven’t had an all nighter in ages. Thing is, I’ve never had one on a day where I have PE and I’m usually exhausted and nodding off all throughout the day after an all nighter so now I’m scared I’m gonna faint and I don’t know what to do. I can’t missed school because I missed a bunch of it last week for a foot surgery so I’m already behind.
Signal	I’m so so exhausted. Like to my core. Everything hurts. I have barely slept for months and it just never ends and it’s becoming increasingly unbearable. My life is good but insomnia has made it hell and I just want it to end. I feel like every second of every day is torture and it’s slowly killing me. I’ve genuinely tried everything. I lay in bed praying to just die because never ending wakefulness is hell on earth. I feel so helpless and hopeless.
Signal	Finally brought it up and got a script for Trazodone. Tonight will be my first night taking it! Anyone have all the benefits and none of the side effects?I got 90 50 mg pills. Planned on cutting some in half and doing 25 mg for a few nights to feel it out. Anyone suggest something different?
Signal	Title says it all. I used to go to bed late like 2 weeks ago at around 3am-4am but I’ve been taking my sleeping meds at 12 then going to sleep at 1, then waking up at around 3am. It’s 6am right now and I’m sick of this bs I keep canceling plans in the morning because I’m so tired and i hate it. Pisses me off so much like why can’t I just get the sleep I need. I was supposed to go to the gym today at 12 in the noon but looks like I’m canceling once again, bc last time I didn’t cancel I was so tired it was unbelievable. Idk what to do this sucks. Any help would be appreciated.
Signal	Last summer due to difficulty sleeping when I had exceptionally nice things planned the next day, I bought some Jamieson brand 5 mg melatonin. I took it a bunch of times after I went to bed and couldn't fall asleep in an hour or two. I actually felt more awake afterwards most times. Several times I noted that before taking it I could get into a sort of less clearly conscious state that's like the beginning of sleep (but not really go to sleep) and after I couldn't even get to that state. I only had one single good night of sleep on it, when I was intending to go to sleep earlier. One time I took multiple pills hoping that would help me sleep, but it just got me very slightly fucked up in a not particularly enjoyable way.So, I threw it away. Since then I've had nights when it took me a long time to fall asleep, but I always fell asleep eventually. So, it really seems like the melatonin was keeping me awake.5 mg sounds like a ridiculously high dose compared to what seemingly knowledgeable articles say online. I don't know if that might have been a problem. But, I don't intend to experiment more with melatonin now.
NotSignal	Dad's ugly cousin recommended pumpkin seeds...I googled pumpkin seeds and they are for men's health not for sleeping!!! I once tried a thing called Valerie roots or something... They didn't work :( and once I tried another kind of flower (no idea what it is...) and nope... So... tell me some of ur experiences with natural foods and herbs... HTP5also didn't work for me whatever it is
Signal	My close relatives still tell me this and honestly i don't know if i should laugh or cry about it lmao. Like yeah thanks, i never thought of that, maybe i should've just tried that instead of suffering so many entire nights, spending so much money on different pills, etc. I've been struggling with a messed up sleeping schedule for almost an entire year now, it has affected most aspects of my life including my studies, yet i feel so invalidated by the people around me that I find it hard to say 'I have insomnia' or anything of the sort because some times i feel like maybe people are right and i'm just not trying hard enough.Anyone relates? :/*fun/sad note: it's 10AM and i still haven't slept.
Signal	For some background, I am a student and when my school shut down I was forced to go back home to my parent’s house. My dad is an emotionally abusive narcissist and my parents are in a very unhappy, toxic marriage (tried to divorce 3 times). Being here is bad for my mental health on top of all the stress of the shutdown: my program being abruptly cancelled (I was on a study aboard), issues with housing, roommates, finals, etc.The moment I got “home” I started having trouble sleeping falling asleep. Then I started having trouble staying asleep. It eventually progressed to me taking 3-5 hours to fall asleep with over the counter meds (melatonin/doxylamine succinate) and then waking up every 30 minutes. I do not drink any caffeine, I exercise 4-6 days a week in the morning (weightlifting, CrossFit, tennis, yoga) in addition to taking 30-45 minute walks outside. I don’t nap during the day or stay in bed late in the morning. I tried not using electronics hours before going to bed, read books instead. My doctor prescribed me Ambien, which would allow me to sleep 8 hours. But he wants me to wean off of the medication. As I’ve lowered the dose I’m experiencing the same insomnia as before. Does anyone have any advice? My insomnia is tied to being stuck with my parents, but I won’t be able to leave until my school reopens in 2-3 months.
NotSignal	is this normal?is there a name for this?does anyone else experience this?what could cause this?
Signal	tl;dr: Age 40, Female. Have ADHD. Still working full-time. Am tired by 10pm but can't sleep until 1am.Background: I'm a female, age 40, in the US. I'm lucky to be keeping my job (for now), at my regular salary, and working about 9-5pm Mon-Fri. No kids, not married.- For the past few years, I can't sleep before 1am. Even though I'm tired at 9pm. - I'll go to my room about 9pm, start to lie down. Surfing the internet, to see what friends are up to. And then I think 'time to get ready to go to sleep' and instead, I'll stay on my phone.- At midnight, I'll take a sleeping pill, get ready for bed, and then surf the internet until 1am. - Could it be hormones? something else? People said to download an app that would shut my phone down by a certain time - of course, I haven't done that. I tried to entice myself trying to take a bath (which I love), and I skipped a bath. Is there anything else you'd recommend?Thanks.
NotSignal	Right, last week I slept badly. One night I didn't sleep, the next night was 3 hours and the night after was 5 hours. I couldn't fall asleep. Now, tonight, I got to sleep fine but now I can't stay asleep. I keep waking up and it takes me an hour to fall back. It's weird - I guess lockdown is really starting to mess me up.
NotSignal	Ive been up for about 3 days and I’m thinking about going to urgent care. Someone suggested it to me. What would urgent care do if went there saying I can’t sleep? Sound stupid to me but I really needa sleep.
NotSignal	I'm not joking. I have two states. I don't sleep at all or I sleep around 12 hours. Doctors think I'm fucking with them, that insomnia and hypersomnia just don't happen together, but here I am! Either way, when I am awake I am tired. I don't remember how being not tired feels... Sometimes it gets so bad all my body aches, I don't want to eat, I am feeling nauseous and my head hurts. I can't normally function because even if I do get 12 hours of sleep I am tired and instead of doing something productive I prefer lying with my eyes closed. Still better then feeling constant phantom pain in my chest when I don't sleep. For as long as I remember I've been sleeping much more than people my age but now I've stopped sleeping at all. I've tried asking for meds but, as I said before, my doctors think I'm fucking with them. I much prefer sleeping 12 hours - thank you! I'm not really mentally stable (anxiety, episodes of depression) but I manage just fine... When I can sleep. Insomnia makes me lose my grip on my head and fuels my anxiety which prevents me from sleeping. I fall into a circle of suffering. 🙃I asked people around but they think I'm joking when I say that being tired hurts. Do any of you experience it? Or perhaps a mix of insomnia and hypersomnia? Everyone around me tells me that I should deal with it on my own, that what I describe is not serious, but shit. I'm afraid that someday I may end up hurting myself. I've literally tried once to knock myself out and trust me, bad idea. (sorry for grammar mistakes but I can't remember the last time I slept tbh)
Signal	I \[22f\] am thinking of quitting my job largely due to my insomnia. I work with young children all day and it's physically and emotionally draining at the best of times when I do get sleep. However lately at least two nights a week I have to work on 0 sleep. I have over $12k saved and am also studying full time, and honestly just want to quit and focus on that. Has anyone else quit their stressful job due to this? If you did, were you able to improve your sleep schedule/ kickstart your life back into gear?
Signal	For me, melatonin actually causes me to have panic attacks when trying to sleep or rather when it does work it gives me incredible vivid nightmares. Anyone else have this issue? I've stopped taking melatonin for that reason and just letting my body make its own. I was taking anywhere from 2-5 mg (I believe) 1.5 hours before bedtime
NotSignal	I just started a new job about 5 weeks ago. For the first 4 weeks, I’ve been working a relatively constant 9am - 5pm and have been able to sleep just fine. Starting this Monday, I’ve been working long hours (7am - 10pm) and have has trouble falling asleep once I get home. My mind races and I keep recalling conversations/tasks with my coworkers. I look at the computer screen most of the day, and have applied the blue shift to try to save my eyes. Anyone experienced something similar and found a solution?
NotSignal	Does anyone feel really weak and lethargic during the day? Like my whole body feels weak and like I’m dying during the day. Idk if that had to do with insomnia or something else.
Signal	I slept for 3 hours yesterday and the most annoying part is that I was okay the whole day. I wasn't tired and I was functioning and I didn't even sleep even during the afternoon when I usually take a nap. Every time I close my eyes I just get scared . Scared of my future. Scared that I'm a disappointment and scared of failure. I'm only 16 am I even supposed to be feeling like this cause I'm scared I'm not okay and no one is taking this seriously. I mean I get it I an Indian and in our society mental illness is hoax. I'm just not okay and I haven't felt okay in a long time. I'm proud that I can share the fact that I'm not okay.
Signal	I have not gone to a doctor and I have not been diagnosed with insomnia, but for the past weeks I've had problems falling asleep, getting at most 5 hours a night but mostly 0-2. For two days in a row now I've been able to fall asleep, and not just because I'm so sleep deprived I pass out. I think my inability to sleep came from being scared of going to sleep and not being able to sleep, a bad cycle. I tried every tip and thing and everything with sleep hygiene, and don't get me wrong, sleep hygiene is definitely important, but it wasn't my problem. So by making all of these changes to better my sleep hygiene I actually worsened my anxiety, it made my entire day fixated around sleep. Whenever I'd do something different I'd be like "wait, why am I doing this? Oh right, because I can't sleep". I think the thing that you're supposed to get out of bed after twenty minutes messed me up. Because again, it wasn't my bed that made me anxious, it was going to sleep anywhere in general. And normally before any of my sleeping problems i think I took somewhere around 30 minutes to fall asleep, so getting up after 20 minutes completely messed me up. Because I couldn't sleep because of anxiety, I'd rather stay up for as long as possible even if I was getting tired, so the "get up and try again when you feel tired again" didn't work for me either because I'd rather be tired than tortured by my anxious thoughts in bed. A few days ago I went back to my bad sleep hygiene habits, and I finally slept. It gave my brain a sense of normalcy. I went to bed a little earlier to make me less stressed as I knew I had plenty of time, I went to bed early and didn't look at the time until my alarm rang the next morning. Didn't pick up my phone, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, nothing. Because doing that tells my brain "oh, I can't sleep and we've given up on the thought of successfully sleeping". A huge tip for those who can't sleep solely because of fear of sleeping, is daydreaming. It'll help your brain to not focus on the now, to be less conscious and to hopefully drift away. If you can't sleep, you'll have something to focus on to make your anxiety less worse. I know a lot of people have problems sleeping because they have too many thoughts, but for me it was the opposite. My brain felt incredibly empty and I could feel the walls of my head touching eachother, so now I think about something fun to daydream about when I fall asleep. I don't know if it will, but hopefully this'll help someone! Sleep hygiene is definitely important but in my case it just made me obsessed over sleep.
Signal	Anyone had good experience with for Amitriptyline, I’m on the 4th day and it’s not helped a bit with sleep. I know AntiD’s can take up to 6 weeks to work as I take citalopram but for the sleep assistance it should work immediately - is this correct? Don’t want to put another drug in my body is it’s not going to work for its main purpose. Any ideas?
Signal	so i tried to take melatonin yesterday because ritalin gives me a hard time to sleep, but this morning i do not feel refreshed and i woke up 2-3 time at night and feel asleep instently. any reccomendation to help with the resless sleep?
NotSignal	in February 2013, I began noticing signs that I'm no longer feeling sleepy. a few months later in May and my sleep quality went completely kaput. Ever since that point, I have early-morning awakenings [wake up a few hrs before my normal wake-up time] and my sleep quality is no longer correlated with my sleep quantity. in Nov. 2013, I had a sleep study done and it read that my sleep was normal. but that I had light delta waves and more stage I/II than III and IV. in Feb. 2014, my sleep quality and sleepiness further decreased. it remained stable-poor for almost 5 years when in Jan. 2019 it spontaneously went down even further. from then on my eyelids began twitching [craving for sleep] and I feel light-headed. this is now 365 a year. every single day. a few weeks ago this month [Jan 2020] my sleep quality went down more again and now I have sharp pains in my head. my sleep is now extremely light and I don't feel well-rested at all. no matter how long I sleep for. I went to my doctor's for a check-up and my blood work is normal. I don't know what to do. I cannot afford seeing a neurologist and I don't know if I have some sort of prion disease in my brain. Please help me.
NotSignal	Was cage the elephant the actual first band to sing that though?? Ozzy has an album called that but not a song idk now that’s all I can think about. Anyways I can’t sleep again what else is new
NotSignal	Normally its bad, but before last night I always was able to go to sleep at around 3AM. My parents finally noticed that not sleeping enough was affecting my grades and got some melatonin for me. I’ve used that a couple times but it doesn’t even actually do anything. Last night I went to bed around 10 because I was still hopeful that it would help. It didn’t. The moment I turned off the lights I just felt really energetic and I couldn’t get comfortable. I kept on moving around, but nothing worked. I would toss and turn while thinking about random ideas and stuff, and everything was really loud. The sound of my dog breathing, the heater vent, random electrical noises, and most of all some unidentified ringing noise that wouldn’t go away. I’ve never been high before but how I felt is close to how I would imagine being high feels like. It’s possible that I slept for an hour or so because there are a few gaps in what I remember between like 3-4 AM . The weirdest part is that I still just don’t feel tired, even while I’m at school, right now, at lunch. I still feel energetic. Normally when I get very little sleep I’m tired for most of the day because I feel like I should get back to bed. But today, well I never felt tired in the first place. So I still have energy. Or something.Sleep is weird.
NotSignal	Everything started exactly 2 weeks ago. I had a discussion with my parents and I could not sleep well, so I went to a sofa but it didn't help, that's where hell began. Some days I sleep 6 hours, some none at all. Yesterday I slept 5 but only bc I took trazodone 50 mg. I read abt SFI and i'm really scared of having it or that my fear of not sleeping is going to kill me eventually since I sleep so little. I asked my parents to take me to the hospital but they don't want to bc of corona and said they will just give me pills and schedule me a psychologist for next month, so I'm f**** up. I already have chest pain but there is literally nothing I can do about it, so I will just wait until I die slowly :( probably from a heart attack
NotSignal	Are doxylamine succinate and diphenhydramine the same? Can I take doxylamine succinate if I'm allergic to diphenhydramine?
Signal	Ok so I’m a very light sleeper, I’ve always had problems getting a good night sleep especially since having a child (she’s 2 now). I have finally found the solution to my sleeping problems! I’ll just need to sleep in... a coffin! While having insomnia last night, I was literally struck with that idea. It would solve most of my issues. Hear me out: no more ear plugs, coffins seem to be somewhat soundproof! I will no longer hear my boyfriend snoring. Then, a coffin is pitch black so no more eye mask needed to block away those sun rays! Since coffins sit only one person, no more elbows in my ribs from my boyfriend or midnight kicks to wake me up. Finally, I won’t have Mr Kitty CatCat sleeping ON my legs, or in between them or me having to work my way around the cat like some sort of Cirque du Soleil contorsionist! No more getting suddenly awaken but Mr Cat biting my toes in the middle of the night! Now I only have to install AC and I am up and sleeping! Or should I say, down and SLEEPING!

NotSignal	(Warning, i started venting quite a bit)I insist on staying up very late and then when it comes to needing to sleep bc the week is over and I have school ontop of the insomnia also I'm very much not even remotely worn out which makes it ten times harderI just spent about half an hour trying to sleep and I couldnt because I kept thinking about this one time when I was like 12 or 13 me and some friends went to this swimming area called splash and a friend pushed me in so I got out and pushed him in which annoyed him and he tried to drown me and i started thinking how I was lucky that im good at thinking rationally in dangerous situations and not panicking while also being thankful it was one of the days where I could hold my breath for a long period of time because sometimes I can and sometimes I cant. We then carried on like nothing happened but then i couldnt remember if i slept round that night or not and I was trying really hard to remember the day and I tried to stop but then I started arguing with myself about how I need to stop thinking and sleep and then decided I should give up and woke up and found hereSorry for the mini rant but fuck sleeping problems, it pisses me off because it's so fucking unfair that I have a disadvantage i cant do anything about because my mum refuses to accept i need sleep medication. I've been so close to buying dodgy sleep medication from people so many times. I want to just be able to sleep is that too much to ask? The only reason I sometimes smoke weed is because I can sleep like a baby and its beautifal being able to just put my head on the pillow and drift on my music into a deep sleep
NotSignal	I have RLS, restless leg syndrome sometimes. And some disorder or trait that makes my brain when I'm trying to sleep also feel restless to the point it increases the sound sensitivity in my ears, leaving me moving around in bed a lot while trying to sleep.Worst fucking feeling ever.
NotSignal	So i'm laying in bed and i may fall asleep if the sleep gods allow it, but i notice that my heartrate doesn't go down at all, i'm entirely focused. Does anyone else have this problem?
Signal	sometimes if I'm laying in bed at night and I'm laying facing my left/right wall of my room, out of my peripheral vision I see a little black hole on the middle of my ceiling. if I look at it, it disappears. but if I don't, it just grows and gets bigger until it's as big as my whole ceiling. I can't sleep knowing it's there. I haven't slept in days and I don't know what to do. it terrifies me, i don't know why but it's somehow unsettling. does this happen to y'all too or am I just crazy?
Signal	Since i was a kid, sleep has always been very hard to get. When it turns dark, my anxiety turns on and the thing iam scared of, is not getting any sleep. Is was reacently diagnosed with adhd and i am prescribed with ritalin. Anyone here who has any experience with taking meds after a night of no sleep? will it keep me awake and let my do my work?
Signal	Just venting- I’m at the point where I’m feeling the zaps. I want to cry but I can’t. My body is exhausted. I lost a cousin today and oddly feel jealous. Everyone is talking about him but it’s all a fog. Genuinely ZERO emotion. I feel bad for not feeling bad. I know it’s the lack of sleep. I’m backed up with work. I don’t particularly care. I’ll just avoid checking the emails. My mind just won’t stay steady. I spent 2 hours at my new gym and even tried out the sauna. Drove home. Got sleepy and tried not to be excited to avoid jinxing it. I’m wide awake now yet full on zombie mode. I just laid in the darkness for about 2 hours before picking my phone back up again. I’ll admit I did giggle for a bit about how crying out of frustration oddly seems to work. Too bad the tears don’t feel like coming by tonight either. Can someone just knock me out? The worst part is that I know this isn’t the last time.
Signal	I (18F) am struggling with (what I suspected to be) insomnia. A little backstory: so basically I’ve had irregular sleep patterns ever since I started high school. I would sleep after 12AM most of the time and I would wake up at 6AM. Sometimes I would be able to nap after school but there were multiple recurrences (toward graduation) where I would go weeks on sleeping 6 hours(or less) a night. Now I go to university where again I have to wake up at 6AM and since I have difficulty falling asleep at night, I’m back to the 6 hours of sleep a day. However there are also times when no matter how tired I am, I fall asleep at 3AM and I have to function with 3 hours a sleep for days. As of now, my city is in quarantine and since I am not going to university, my sleep schedule has been even more messed up. For the past few weeks, I have slept at around 3AM and woken up at 11:30 to 12PM. This has caused my body’s functioning to completely reschedule and I have seen increased anxiety and tiredness. I can’t really do anything during the day and I am in bed by 12AM but not asleep until 3AM. Also, I would like to add that if I don’t lay in bed for a few hours from 12AM to 3AM, I won’t fall asleep even by 3AM.Therefore, I would like to ask for your advice regarding this situation. What should I do to get my sleep cycle to the ideal 10PM to 6AM? I have tried the breathing techniques but they don’t work and I do admit to using my phone before bed but I use it with a blue light filter. As a side note, I am writing this at 3:40AM as I literally can’t sleep for the life of me. Please help.:)
Signal	Hi guysJust really need to vent and hoping someone here can tell me this doesn’t last forever. I’ve gone to the ER twice. I’ve slept about 10 hours in two and a half weeks. The longest time I went without sleep was 8 days. This insomnia started about 7 months ago and I’ve never had sleeping problems before that. At the ER the psychologist said this likely is a depressive response to trauma that occurred last year (my best friend was murdered in her sleep.)I’ve tried so many things I don’t even want to list it all, I don’t even know if I’m looking for advice. I’m currently on seroquel and the first night I got 5 hours of sleep on it and was so excited, but tonight I haven’t slept a wink despite doubling my dosage. (50 to 100). If anyone has tips on how to best use seroquel for sleep (ie nighttime routine.. what time to take it at etc etc) please let me know Also I’m considering buying a weighted blanket so if anyone has experience w that I’m curious to hear too Sorry this post is so hodgepodge I’m just really not thinking straight, it’s hard to not feel like this is going to last forever and I’m never going to sleep or feel rested. I feel like a shell of a person. Also if anyone has similar experience to me where the insomnia was triggered by some kind of trauma, and you worked through it, please share that’s something I really need to hear rn. Agh, thanks for listening
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for about 7 years or so since I was a teenager and have tried a bunch of medications that have been prescribed for me over the years, none which have been effective.Nothing seems to sedate me/make me feel tired. I’ve tried various benzos (Valium, clonazepam, temazepam), anti depressants and antipsychotics (on Seroquel at the moment) but nothing seems to work. Anyone have a similar experience?
Signal	Been to a doc recently and I brought up the fact I sometimes have the issue of falling asleep (lie in bed for 2-3 hours). To be more specific I’ll lie down in complete darkness and silence and roll around for maybe 20-40mins before I give up and look at my phone for 10-20mins before attempting to sleep again. She told me I don’t have insomnia because I have uninterrupted sleep (I usually sleep 6.5-7.5 hrs if no one disturbs me). Another note is I’ll usually feel tired af after 2-3hours of being awake and I may have depression. (Not confirmed but I’m getting it checked soon)
NotSignal	I slept almost exactly one hour and woke up from a nightmare, is it better than no sleep at all? (my anxiety tells me 1 hour makes no difference) Should I try and nap during the day (if I even manage to fall asleep) or just do my hardest to stay awake till night comes along? I wish I had atleast gotten 2 hrs but hey. :)
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for years. I fall asleep but wake up four or five hours later and can’t get back to sleep. I’ve tried a million things but even prescribed sleep meds are a hit or miss. My husband thinks CBD might help and I’ve tried some gummies to no avail. He thinks I need to go ask the professionals at a CBD store in town to get the dose right. My question is, has anyone had any success with CBD? I have my doubts and I don’t want to waste my time/money if it’s snake oil
NotSignal	I just feel like I get full fast and feel like not eating, I dont know why. I have had trouble sleeping for like 2 days and I feel worried.
NotSignal	For the past couple of days I have been stuck in this horrible patten.I will stay up for 24 hours, u will nearly collapse where I am and sleep for 2-4 hours then be up for 10+ hours then sleep for 4-7 hours.I have tryed everything I can think of. Meditation. Herbal teasLight exercise before hand. No tea or coffee after a set hour. Phone an hour before bed. Change what side I sleep on. Clear my room of old junk. Fancy oils and sentsI'm stuck.
Signal	I’m 21 years old and i’ve been so anxious to go to sleep for almost 2 months now. Because of it I have trouble to either fall asleep or stay asleep, it depends. Sometimes, i’ll even pull an all nighter. I found that a 7.5 mg pill of Zopiclone really helps me to get a good night of sleep as well as ZzzQuil. I don’t want to get a tolerance too fast so that’s why I plan to alternate between the three of them. I know about those long term consequences with the usage of those meds (early dementia, memory troubles, etc.) Also, I know that I am young and I don’t know after how much time will I experience those side effects. I know that I should seek help for a therapist and that a CBT/ACT therapy would really help me and probably cure in some ways my anxiety that cause my insomnia. BUT due to the pandemic, I have stopped working and money is tight, I can’t afford a therapist at the moment, so I’m trying to find alternatives solutions..
Signal	I have been going through this thing where I can’t sleep every other night and the second night I manage to get to sleep because I’m so tired... but I’ve gotten anxiety now about sleeping. I might have been able to nod off last night in the early hours but I was just so anxious about it that I couldn’t. I’m looking for guided meditations that can help reduce anxiety about sleeping. Thanks and may you be well.
NotSignal	Went through some emotional stuff recently. I know that the long-term solution is to improve the root cause of these emotional problems, hence I’m in a waiting list for counseling.But in the mean time are there any temporary solutions that can help grab me at least a few hours sleep each night?I’m completely ignorant to this topic so apologies for that - normally I’d do a few days research before asking for help but feel like this is the best place for it
Signal	Wow, I just found a subreddit for insomnia. Awesome.I've been an insomniac for most of my life. I remember sleeping well as a kid. I had sleep problems as a teen, young adult, adult, and now I'm 50 it's really bad.I've never seen a doctor for it. I don't even know if there IS such a thing as a sleep doctor.To get to sleep I usually drink alcohol, take Benadryl, take Ambien, take Oxycodone, take medical marijuana (either via vape or tincture) and use sleep sounds on YouTube. My wife rubs my head and face which also helps a lot.My wife is the kind of person who can fall asleep the second her head hits the pillow, and I'm so jealous. I would like to become a person like that.Any advice on how to achieve that?
Signal	I have been suffering from insomnia for about more than a year now. I used to use marijuana for it, which made it a bit more manageable, but didn't cure the issue. Now, marijuana has turned on me and gives me intense anxiety, and I am unable to get more than 3 hours of sleep without the help of xanax and zzzquil. I have decided that I want to try to get an actual prescription sleeping aid and get myself off of everything that i'm taking (xanax, melatonin, zzzquil, tryptophan, and weed) and then slowly wean off of it once I have my anxiety in check, but I am unsure of what is best for me. I would try to use solely xanax, but I build a tolerance to benzos extremely quickly, so it is not something I can take daily. Some drugs I have tried that didnt work are:* Belsomra* Sonata* Tamazepam* Trazadone I am looking at trying lunesta because I read on Harvard health that it is quite good for anxiety induced insomnia and that participants in a study didnt build a tolerance for 6 months, but I am unsure. Does anyone have any experience with prescription sleeping aids?Also, I just want to mention that sleeping aids are not my first option. I've tried meditation, hypnotherapy, sleep hygiene, etc before anyone tries to recommend those things.
NotSignal	I have a bit of a scratchy dry throat, I think it's a minor cold. I couldn't get to sleep at all last night because every time I started to drift away my body would swallow involuntary and jolt me back awake. I think taking a hit of 50mg of diphenhydramine dried my throat out also.Honestly at this point I think I may be losing it
Signal	After an exhausting 24/48 hours I slept for 4 hours. Now I'm in the 3 am wakeup stage again. It happens almost every night and it's when I'm at my lowest ebb. The last few weeks I have had no sleeping pattern at all, I just wake and sleep as my body dictates but it means I have no social life, I can't be with my partner when he's available, I can't do anything!Right now I'm peckish (not hungry, I just want the taste) but I can't be bothered to get out of bed for food. I want to go back to sleep but can't. I want to go and get some pills but don't want to get out of the warm bed into the cold air. I want, I want, I want. Argh!
Signal	Hello. Long, long ti(M)e lurker.I have had problems sleeping since I was a freshman in highschool. I'm 20 now and still have issues. Back when my inability to sleep first presented itself as a problem beyond the occasional sleepless night, I begged and pleaded with my mom to get me help. She didn't believe me. I would cry and explain that going 3 days with no sleep is not normal and I'm not making it up, etc etc (surely you guys know this drill). All of this to no avail.Fast foreward to the present day and the issue persists. I just got off the phone with my mother explaining to her my problems and what needs to be done.She acknowleded me with some surface level remark and then proceeded to tell me about her crypto investments.She literally does not give a fuck.I've been awake for 2 days now and I couldn't help but cry and throw a tantrum to myself. My anger manifested itself in tears, kicking things, wanting to just explode, etc. I was wildly explosive, pacing back and forth muttering the things I wish I could tell my mom but won't.I don't know how much more of this I can take. I have lost everything. Insomnia has made it impossible to function and pursue my dreams and it's worse when the people you expect to care about you don't give a single fuck.This is just a rant now. Idk what do to man. My logic is not even workinf right anymore.My father is another nightmare.I just want to sleep.
NotSignal	Anybody have successful or unsuccessful experiences with cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) that they could share? I like the research
NotSignal	April to May was absolute hell for me sleep wise I wouldn’t get to sleep until like 7am because of anxiety and personal reasons, then i got better for a few months, and it took that one damn night of rough sleep 2 nights ago for me to start being anxious about my sleep quality once again , what’s worse is the fact that school starts this Tuesday, so i’m sorta fucked.
Signal	I'm currently in my second week-plus insomnia spell in the last two months. For some reason I'm getting stuck in the "half-dream" phase of falling asleep, **recognizing I'm falling asleep** and getting excited about it, which actually gives me a shot of adrenaline and wakes me up! Does anyone else experience this? It happens several times throughout the night and basically leaves me with no sleep until I reach the point of sheer exhaustion after perhaps 1-2 full days with no sleep. Then I crash for about 9-12 hours because I'm so backed up. (This also has my circadian rhythm in shambles at the moment.)I've had insomnia and sleeping problems on and off as far back as I can remember, but I don't recall ever encountering this maddening situation before. I kind of spend the course of every day with a dark cloud in the back of my mind about whether or not I'll fall asleep at night, so is this just basically a form of sleep anxiety that is tormenting me when the moment finally arrives to go to bed? Are there any meds that can help this? It's driving me insane.
Signal	Yesterday I saw a post that really inspired me on r/Drugs in which someone which was in a very similar situation to mine (regarding battling mental health issues and addiction) and I hoped I could accomplish something similar maybe here maybe giving someone somewhere a glimmer of hope.During my truly rock bottom phase I had severe insomnia. It was present before this, but at this time it flared up uncontrollably. My usual meds didn't help and I was so paranoid and anxious quadrupled at the time, you know that feeling of absolute agony being afraid to not being able to fall asleep. OD'ing was basically my way of sleeping and unfortunately for me that was a regular occurrence. I came close to death several times during this period and I was absolutely alone in this, nobody knew. I was on the last year of school at that time and my parents were oblivious and my friends chalked it up to the drugs. Then I went too far and died once. Actually died. Too much benzos in too short of a time with too much alcohol had me dying. Not really fortunate, but a friend called an ambulance after finding me laying in a pool of vomit - we were suppose to hangout together that weekend - so he said he got a bad feeling and quickly came to my house. When the medics arrived I was dead. They literally revived me in some miracle way. Afterwards I had a few more less severe OD's but nothing near as serious again. During this severe phase of rock bottom insomnia played a huge part with depression and enhanced anxiety levels through the roof. I was so paranoid and that constant pure agony mental state had me so fucked up, insomnia and sleep deprivation is probably the worst I've gone through and that says a lot, I've been through lots of crazy shit. A lot of people don't understand how severe insomnia can be and it's really one hell of a thing to go through. I really understand how hard it is and can be and I don't have much respect for people generally, but I have a hell of a lot of respect for people going through this. Anyway so what I actually planned to say and bring across is that I've made it out. My insomnia lasted about 3 years and what I described was my rock bottom phase in life in which insomnia played a huge role. However not too long after this I moved away from my old life and my general mental state improved a bit. The meds worked again and not too long I could actually fall asleep without any drugs and the best of all, it stayed that way. It still takes longer than a normal person to fall asleep, but it's still the best improvement I ever made. I'm nowhere near healthy - I still have a lot of other mental issues, but like I said this was the truly worst I had gone through. What I'm thus trying to say and this is probably way longer than necessary, but I really want to give some of you hope out there, trust me I know how extremely hard it can be, but there is definitely hope and a chance for you to get better. I actually made it out which means you can as well. Sorry if that sounds corny, but like I've said I really sympathize with people going through this.
NotSignal	I’ve suffered from mild to moderate insomnia throughout my life and I’ve always ALWAYS wished that I could fall asleep anywhere at any time with no problem, let alone be able to fall asleep in my own bed at bedtime. I’ve tried everything: sleep-aids, Benadryl, meditation, reading, relaxation, music, etc. NOTHING WORKS WELL ENOUGH/LONG ENOUGH AND IT’S DRIVING ME INSANE. I don’t want to have to TRY to fall asleep, you know? Sometimes it is because of anxiety but sometimes I will get into this weird sleepy state where my mind will fixated on an... inorganic thought? For example, right now I tried to fall asleep and I was almost there until I realized in my half-conscious state that all I was thinking about was the fact that when I curled up against my blanket, I was forming a very square shape from the top of my head down? It made no sense but it kept repeating in my mind. One night all that was running through my mind was the wavy shapes that were made from all the contact points between my body and the bed itself. Sometimes my mind won’t stop playing a singular lyric or riff from a song. Sometimes I won’t stop thinking about the movement of my feet. It’s all cyclical and rapid and endless until I actively wake myself up to full consciousness and try to start over. But sometimes it just happens again. It’s like a CD that won’t stop skipping. It makes no sense in regular conversation, but when my mind comes up with something like that it’s all that it can think of and I cannot fall asleep. Anyone know what’s up? And maybe any advice because I’m desperate. :( I’m so close to begging a doctor to write me a prescription for something.
Signal	I've been reading posts on this sub, and have seen this claim multiple times - whatever helps your sleep merely eases the symptoms, but doesn't fix the underlying cause which is claimed to always be mental.What do you think of this? For the past 3 years that I've been struggling with chronic fatigue and sleep issues, I've been hard pressed to find anything I'm anxious or depressed about that could be the cause. And I've done quite a lot of soul-searching to find it. In my case it feels entirely physical - my brain just says meh to sleep, no matter what. What is the medical opinion on this? Isn't this what they call "primary insomnia"?
Signal	Has anyone else noticed a peak in their insomnia during the weeks your region gets the most sunlight? For me, that’s around July. I haven’t charted mine to look for patterns, but I really should.I have spoken to doctors over the years about a possible bipolar 2 diagnoses (cyclothymia), however it’s mild enough I can go years without treatment and function well enough to be unmedicated. My husband watches me and will be the first to tell me if he thinks my symptoms are bad enough to go back on a mood stabilizer. So I’m not sure if I have insomnia from a “manic” phase or sunlight or something else.Also, I’m a highly ambitious person when I get an idea for my business, so I’m not sold on the idea it’s mania.
Signal	Hey all! I've been suffering from insomnia for the past ~2 weeks - not being able to fall asleep. It almost feels like I'm forgotten how to fall asleep. I also have GAD, but I'm not on any meds currently for it. 5mg or 7mg of melatonin used to work for me, but now it doesn't do anything.I'm tired when I go to bed, but once it's time to fall asleep, I'm wide awake. So - I recently tried over the counter sleep aid, doxylaminate succinate and that worked like a wonder and knocked me out in like 30min. Does anyone know, how long/often can you use or should you use OTC sleep aid? I'd love to not use any, but I'd rather just take one and actually sleep than be awake all night and then be very sad all day next day.
NotSignal	Very curious about giving Ebb a try but feeling slightly sketched out by the website. Has anyone had success with this device?
Signal	I started having this issue about 3 years ago or so. I have Meniere's Disease BTW, but am not sure if that's at all related here (I suspect it't not).I have this issue that happens maybe around 4 times a month on average, and I've observed that it ONLY ever happens when I am overly sleepy and should have slept earlier. I watch TV on my phone in bed for around an hour or so until I'm really sleepy before falling asleep every night, as I can then fall asleep usually under a minute. I'm just mentioning this as I'm not sure if this might have something to do with my symptom (extreme eye fatigue or something?).Anyhow, the issue is that right as I fall asleep, I kind of have to jolt myself awake because I feel almost paralyzed and almost "out of control". It's incredibly difficult to describe I'm afraid. It's almost like there's movement going on in my head while I'm trying to sleep and so I have to "fight hard" to wake up from my semi-slumber, which is always hard and a pain because it feels like I'm half in sleep mode already and my body is too tired to wake up.I always fix this the same way - I have to gather enough energy to wake myself up enough and then I force myself to use the phone (despite my body wanting to fall asleep) for another 15 minutes or so, and then I can 99% fall asleep with no problems afterwards. Yesterday I had this happen and tried an experiment of looking at the phone for about 1-minute, but that didn't work, I had the episodes again. It's like my body needs to wake up enough to get refreshed enough to reboot and then fall asleep again.Does anyone have any idea what this could be? It's very annoying, but at least it only ever happens when I'm overly tired...
Signal	Hello. Back a few months ago I have a very serious bout of insomnia. Went to the hospital, spent a few days in the psych unit, blah blah blah. Was prescribed seroquel for newly diagnosed bipolar and to help me sleep.I have been on the seroquel since then and it initially helped me with sleep but now I am having trouble staying asleep. I will wake up every night between 3-4AM like clockwork and have a lot of difficulty getting back to sleep. My psychiatrist would increase the dosage of seroquel but I'm at 400MG right now and still having issues staying asleep. He is trying to wean me off of the high dose of seroquel and introduce ambien long-acting for sleep instead. He said that I can take 200MG of seroquel with 12.5MG of ambien but I am unsure. The pharmacist even said that I can take them together but I am very worried about being hungover the next day. I have halved all of my ambien pills (the insurance company would only pay for half a month's supply anyway) and I plan on trying to take it with only 100MG of seroquel but I am afraid.Has anyone had any experience taking both at the same time? How did it go?
NotSignal	I try to get to bed at 10:00pm every night, I would say I manage 5-6 nights a week where I’m able to fall asleep, but 1 night a week where I can only manage 5-6 hours. I know for many of you that sounds normal and not an issue but for me I’m very sleep sensitive. If I lose an hour or two of sleep my whole day the next morning is ruined pretty much.
Signal	You know how it goes- a sleepless night spent worrying about not being able to sleep. The next night, the pressure is even higher, so again no sleep. So you take some medicine or drugs to sleep and feel like shit the next day. And so on and so on until... what? Last time I got scared because I knew if I went through a cycle of insomnia again I might not make it out. I don’t want to do anything drastic but I physically and emotionally cannot do this again. I can’t.
NotSignal	I would love to know what worked for you guys, could apply it to me. Been almost 2 months since I have it and has made my life living hell.
Signal	Hi all. I am 35 and healthy. I have an issue that I have struggled with for about a year or so. I had a job a few years ago that required me to report to work at 6am. I was always an early riser, so I would get up around 4:30-5ish and it was no problem. However, these days I work from home and there is no need to wake up so early. Yet, I still do it, sometimes even 3:30am or even earlier. I go to bed around 9-10, so I usually get at least 5:30-6 hours of sleep...which isn't really the best, but it also probably isn't that unusual for many people. Still, my schedule allows virtually unlimited sleep and I wish I could sleep in. One of the questions a doctor may ask is, well, do you feel tired? The answer is, not really. I work out 5-6 times a week and generally have decent energy. But sometimes, I absolutely crash, and I just know I need more sleep.I drink a lot of caffeine first thing in my morning, which keeps me alert and focused, and I also am prescribed Adderall for ADHD, an issue I have had on/off for years, but this sleep issue began well before the use of the amphetamine. To be frank, sometimes I feel like the lack of sleep actually *caused* my focus to decrease. I am open to all of my doctors etc about these issues and most of them think of it as a relatively benign issue that requires experimentation...cutting back caffeine, or blue light, or social media use at night, etc. I occasionally take a nap during the afternoon which helps. Truthfully, I think the problem is actually caffeine. I believe what happens is that literally, my body, after 18-24 hours or whatever, goes into a sort of caffeine withdrawl. Right when this happens, is usually right when I would be waking up, 4-5am, and thus quenching my bodies addiction to the caffeine. I do also confidently state that this early waking did NOT start when I went back on Adderall. As a matter of fact, I think (as my doctor also stated is possible) Adderall actually is *helping* me sleep, because if I take the XR capsule in the morning, when it wears off in the evening, I am even more tired. &#x200B;Anyone have any advice or discussion? I am probably going to cut back on my caffeine and late night social media use. In addition to this, it is very well documented across most of the ADHD forums I follow that stimulant meds work a lot better without caffeine. &#x200B;Thanks all, and hope you're staying healthy.
Signal	So here goes : I'm finally coming to terms with it. I've got insomnia. I'm a university student , M , 23 years old, 172lbs. I literally do not sleep. I pull frequent all nighters to try to get back on track and it never helps. Once I hit roughly the 24 hour mark, I just seem to stay up to about the 40 hour mark, get 8 hrs and the cycle repeats itself at exactly where I left off. Over the course of 2-3 weeks, I'll stay up another hour later or two again. Slowly making myself stay up later and later and later, until boom, my sleep schedule is something like awake from 4pm- 8-9 am then sleeping from 8-9 am until 4-5 pm. Idk how to reverse this. Idk what to take. Please give me suggestions. I take two Benadryl and 6mg of melatonin and it literally doesn't do anything to me. I'm at a witts end. I know I need to do a sleep study but it seems as if my doctor thinks I don't need one. He has the idea that 8 hours of sleep is 8 hours no matter when you get it. What he doesn't understand is that a lot of times I stay up literally past physical exhaustion and then just fall into a 14 hour sleep, and I'm on some new odd schedule for another month until I stay up for another 48 hrs until this repeats itself. I think not working and being In school has a lot to do with this. When I worked I was on an ok sleep schedule. Now I'm not working since I'm in school full time and I literally do not sleep. Please give me suggestions. I've tried everything I've read online. Best ♥️
Signal	Hi ive had terrible insomnia since june of this year, tryed everything and all kinds of meds, nothing works, my gf jokingly said maybe its because they started the 5g networks in june in our city, i started to investigate 5g and insomnia.And many scientists warned about insomnia, headaches and pain in neck areas and these are all my symptoms, ive read many people explaining the same problems after 5g got installed in their city/neighbourhood,Maybe just a crazy conspiracy theory by people, but if anyone suddenly feel these symptoms after 5g plz tell me, im interested, or just thoughts about 5g linked to insomnia.I hope its bs and i can get a full nights sleep soon, im really tired 💤
Signal	Sometimes I think about just skipping the pills. Just not sleeping. Maybe this would pass by itself then? I don't want to have to wean myself off of pills in addition to not being able to fall asleep...I mean, there was a time I actually fell asleep and slept soundly until morning. Without meds. Maybe if I just held out for a few weeks or months, maybe this would just pass on its own.Then,when the evening comes, I cave in. I take my pills. They don't always help, but when they do it's awesome.Sorry, this kind of turned into a vent/rant.My point was, has anyone just tried to wait it out, has it passed by itself?
Signal	Hi everyone. So my 9 yr old has some sleep issues. It has gotten so much worse since the pandemic hit. He has anxiety OCD and high functioning autism. He has over the past couple years had issues with seizure like activity in his sleep. And what we think and neuro thinks may be abdominal migraines which causes him to wake in extreme pain and vomiting in the middle of the night every 6 months or so for a couple days at a time. Now the pandemic hit. He wont fall asleep unless me or his dad are in there. It takes him hours some nights to fall asleep and will often wake 3-4 times a night. He has alot of restless movements and sleep talking and nightmares. Any advice you all have? He has anxiety the later it gets that he is still up and so basically anxious over not being asleep. We have done benedryl occasionally if it is past midnight and he is still awake. We may try melatonin but not sure on starting dose. Also going to try chamomile tea. His routine starts about 8 after bath/shower which is watches a show then he reads for about 20-30 mins. TV stays on but not on any show just used as a nightlight. Then his dad or i lay in there for hours some nights until were sure he is asleep. Before the pandemic hit and school let out he would fall asleep after his bedtime routine and about 20 mins of laying with him he would sleep without us in there. I know its anxiety based that he needs someone in there at all times. If one of us isnt in there once he is done reading and ready to sleep he comes out every few mins scared. Its getting really hard on him and he is constantly apologizing or feels bad that he is still awake. We tell him its okay and he doesn't need to feel bad. I just dont know what to do or how to help. any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful.
NotSignal	Sorry if this is long:Once my school semester ended last month, I recently started struggling with sleep due to quarantine. I sometimes stay up til 6 am bawling my eyes out just begging for a goodnight sleep lol. So i got prescribed with mirtazapine 15mg to help fall asleep, but i cut it in a quarter cuz the full one keeps me drowsy and sleepy for days. Will i get addicted? Im so scared im gonna get addicted and will rely on it for the rest of my life. This is the second time im using it. ive struggled with sleep for about 5 days (in total). Ive noticed when i get sunlight i sleep better, but i drank too much caffeine last night which kept me awake all night. but i took a bit of the pill again just in case i cant fall asleep. Since i dont want 2 straight restless nights
Signal	Sleep pattern is very weird this month, either very fragmented sleep (wake 4 to 5 times) for 5 to 6 hours or 4 hours of solid sleep or awaken once over course of 9 hours. Feels like getting worse.Had a long bout of insomnia from early January, alternate between reasonable 6 hours to 2 hours sleep, then a day no sleep at all, then atarted getting 3 to 5 hours of fragmented sleep, worsens during March, gets better after being prescribed benzo and luvox and I quit shortly after.
NotSignal	I can't take it anymore. This is *the* worst disorder there fucking is!!! I need tips PLEASE. What has helped you fall asleep? I'm utterly desperate.
Signal	I’m 15 and have had awful trouble sleeping lately. For a few months prior to about a week ago I would usually fall asleep around 4-5:30, so I was fairly ok with my schedule as long as I did sleep. HOWEVER, lately I cannot fall asleep during the nocturnal hours, and instead get about 2 hours of sleep each day in the afternoon. Does anyone have a possible solution? Thanks!
Signal	I started Effexor about seven weeks ago and while it’s helped many things, my sleep is worse than ever. I’m up at 2 a.m. every night. Sometimes I fall back asleep but usually just in time for my alarm to go off. My job requires lots of writing and is high-intensity 10-12 hour days, so being a zombie is problematic.Anyone else experiencing this or have any advice?
Signal	used to have really bad insomnia, got over it, now i feel like it's coming back. i had a terrible shift at work and i feel like my next shifts are just going to keep getting worse and worse and my insomnia is going to keep me up at night because im stressed out. my hypnosis and asmr stuff arent helping as much anymore to get me to sleep. not sure what im going to do now. sorry, i just needed to vent.
Signal	I normally take 20mg of melatonin a night to help me sleep, I go through phases where it works and phases where it doesn’t do shit. I’m in the phase where I might as well not even take anything and it’s just frustrating. I was prescribed trazodone for sleep but it really only helped me the first week I started. I used to just drink alcohol every night to help me shut my mind off but obviously that’s not healthy and it doesn’t help anymore anyway. I’ve brought up my trouble sleeping with every doctor/psychiatrist I’ve had and went to a sleep doctor a few years ago. It seems like they don’t really care to be honest, they just tell me to get off my phone and read a book before bed or to buy those lamps. Is there a better way to tackle getting help for sleep issues?
NotSignal	What’s up everyone. I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while but I’ve never posted, and I felt like 4:30 AM would be an adequate time to make my first post.I don’t know what the hell is going on with me lately. I’ve had sleep issues since I went to college, but god damn it’s never been this bad. I started lexapro in January and they increased my dose about a month ago, and it is fucking my sleep schedule in the ass. It’s just getting laughably annoying at this point.It doesn’t matter what I do, I CANNOT fall asleep before dawn. My brain won’t let me fall asleep until around 6 in the morning, I get woken up around 10 by everyone else in the house, then rinse and repeat. Doesn’t matter how tired I am when I go to bed either. Some part of me that I can’t control just doesn’t want to sleep. I sleep fine during the day too. I take naps in the afternoon sometimes, but I try to avoid doing that so it doesn’t make this worse.I feel like at this point I should just start doing the whole nap thing and build my sleep schedule off of that. Better than being sleep deprived all the time.
Signal	1) my walking has been getting a bit weird and I stumble a bit, my legs feel very heavy, not in pain but its harder to move them, this tends to happen on my worst days, anybody else get this? I also sneeze and get cold/flu symptoms a lot when I get really bad sleep and everything just feels off and hazy like a dream. I tried bringing this up to my gp and they said talk to my psych and i talked to my psych and he has no idea hah2) To anybody taking antidepressants, have they helped or made your sleep worse? My personal struggle... I was on zoloft for anxiety/depression and I slept really well(never had sleeping issues beforehand), then I tapered off after I thought I felt better, then I started getting terrible sleep, was put on quetiapine as well as zoloft after exhausting a lot of other methods both otc and prescription which helped, but started gaining a fair amount of weight so I tapered off of it over a few months, my sleep was alright for a couple of months afterwards then everything got bad again, and I mean really bad, fragmented sleep thats anywhere between 1-4 hours. Thinking I might have to go back on them.....
Signal	Received a partial sample from a domestic vendor and was skeptical of course. I purchased 750mg for 70 USD in BTC/ I used the free first order coupon redditnew10 and the 10$ priority shipping was free. Reddit10: that's 10% off ur first order before ship I received 750 mg pyrazolam,100 mg nifoxipam, and 250 put yellow clam. All products came in 3 days cross 5 the country I was like PRAISE JUNKIE JESUS. The dude had 1cplsd so u know I had to get a 10 strip lol rate 8/10 they were supposed to be 250 uh felt more like 225. The benzos were 10 outta ten. The sample was mad cheap. Of u ever get this offer TAKE IT I have a feeling alot more people in certian rc data bases and randoms will b coming Ships out Oregon but who knows thanks everyoneTook 5 mg to feel altered and 1mg to take away the anxiety and it DID NOT SHOW UP ON FED. Probation UA!
Signal	If you had the choice? I ask because I am long gone (almost a year) from sleep deprivation, but in a new hell of medication side effects.I am on the highest dose of Lunesta (prescribed). I have tried EVERYTHING over 20 years with or without health insurance, and this was the only drug that my doc gave me that allowed me 4 interrupted hours of sleep. But, I also gained 50 lbs over 8 months, I have blackouts like I drank alcohol, but I haven't.. I have memory lapses... I'm drowsy all day...ectWhat's better...the sleep deprivation or the horrible side effects of sleep medication?? Which side of the spectrum would you want to be on?
NotSignal	Title says all. Anyone knows anyways on how to sleep without worry about trying to sleep if that makes sense. I only recently been having a fast (not super fast, i’d say around 90-100bpm) heart beat and heavy pulses for a week which is causing me to stay up. Yesterday i slept about 9 hours in total. 5 without waking up and 2 hours but woke up twice for the bathroom. Yesterday, i tried sleeping and realized i couldn’t sleep which for some odd reason, made my heart race. I wasn’t even intentionally trying to focus on it, it just rather happened. Only was having a fast hear beat for a bit and then fell asleep but today, i can’t sleep because of a fast heart beat . I focused on too much on it and in a way, trying to force myself to sleep which makes me frustrated which i also believe is the cause of my heart beating fastAnyways, again my question is that if theres any way on how to sleep without worrying about sleeping if that makes sense? Would this be anxiety that i have or insomnia ? Already had an ekg test couple months ago and results were sent to the cardiologist and it came out fine. Finally, should i see a doctor so i can take medication? I don’t want to rely on it
NotSignal	I think it’s pretty obvious that I accidentally messed up my Circadian rhythm. I’m not tired until like 3am and I wake up anywhere between 11am and 1pm. Is there any tips (preferably quickly) fix this? I’ve seen many people who had the same problem (like my brother) who stood up all night and fell asleep at a normal time the next day and it fixed it. I don’t know but the thought of that unnerves me because knowing my luck I’ll still not be able to sleep even if I stood up for a literal 24 hours. If nothing works I guess having to wake up at 6 am for school would force my body until adjusting its sleep schedule...
Signal	I have taken Klonopin for several years now through a psychiatrist but was struggling with them only offering antipsychotics as additional options. Klonopin works well for me but doesn't always knock me out and I often have to pair it with antihistamines.My GP is trying me on more things, including Lunesta. She said she is more comfortable offering temazepam than clonazepam. I would rather work just with her on my insomnia as I didn't feel much of what psychiatrists offered was helpful other than the clonezepam. What have your personal experiences been with clonazepam versus temazepam?
Signal	Diazepam and 3 x of the recommended Melatonin + Valeriana + Idontknowwhat and I still can’t fall the asleep, I’m about to start my third day without a single hour of sleep. I’m painfully sleepy, on the verge of absolute exhaustion, I yawn all the time, my eyes are losing focus, I’m so tired that I could fall asleep standing on my feet... but when I go to bed, sleep won’t and won’t come.My partner is sleeping next to me. Their presence is so calming, I snuggle into them and soon I realize my own breathing is getting synchronized with the peaceful rhythm of theirs. It’s almost as if I can get there too, almost. In a few short hours I’m supposed to get out of bed and function like a normal human, and I just want to cry myself to sleep and sleep for 3 days.
Signal	It's gotten to the point where I can't fall asleep during the night and I can only sleep during the day. I stuck with it because day sleep is better than no sleep but I need to get back to sleeping during the night. I tried staing awake until the next night and I ended up not sleeping at all for 2 days. I tried getting sunshine in the morning it didn't work. Is there any other way to get my sleep schedule back to somewhat normal pattern?
Signal	I’m a dad of 4.5 month old twins and I sleep beautifully when they are at grandmas, but when they are under my roof I wake up after a few hours and can’t get back to sleep. Anyone else have the issue of waking up in the middle of the night without the ability to fall back asleep because of babies? It’s devastating! The babies aren’t even crying. It’s like they have a dog whistle that is just for me. I have earplugs, white noise machine, and I sleep in a room that doesn’t have the monitor. It’s driving me nuts.
NotSignal	Of the several times I tried using mirtazapine for a single day, I couldn't sleep at all the following day. This is kind of unfortunate given how effective it is for sleep and the brain fog it gives me make me not want to take it for more than a week.
NotSignal	I HATE the screeching chorus of birds that starts at 4 in the morning but I LOVE getting to watch the sun rise, it's a natural beauty people take for granted just 'cause it happens every day.Also, missed opportunity for April fools, y'all should've raided r/NoSleep.
NotSignal	First I'm going to talk about my life story, and it'll turn into me talking about insomnia-specific things. Rant warning: I will rant about insomnia, doctors, school, work, and maybe some other things. Enjoy.My system specs are:Male22 years old6'0 - 183cm180lbs - 82kgCaucasianAmerican (From Minneapolis, home of arguably America's shittiest weather)Absolutely no alcoholVapes but not muchNot fat by any means but a little "doughy" if I don't have my shirt onI think I only "need" six hours of sleep each nightBoots up at 5:45AM sharp each morningDrinks a decent amount of waterMildly caffeinated but no refueling after 2pmRegular 9-5 office jobNo weed or other illicit substancesProud recipient of *three* sinus surgeriesDrugs only as prescribedAlready received wisdom tooth removal update____________________________________________Four years ago was when things started to go to shit neurologically. I started twitching all over (which still goes on today), I became a nervous wreck, and I lost the ability to fall asleep. It all happened suddenly - from feeling great to feeling like shit in about two weeks and never subsided until now.The only thing that changed was I was going to architecture school and decided to go back to my job on the weekends, adding a little more stress. I guess it was just enough, or it was a coincidence. But that's when I started to feel "neurologically wrong".The worst of the twitching was within the first year for sure. To understand more what the twitching is like see r/BFS or ask and I'll explain further - but it has a serious negative effect on quality of life. It felt like electricity was going through my body all the time. Since then its had its ups and downs, and whenever I think it's gone it will come back with a vengeance. It went from 0-100 on that very first day and since then has very slowly and *on average* been getting better. Like a zig/zag graph downward with a horizontal asymptote slightly above zero if that makes sense.The insomnia was actually a pretty hard kick to morale. In the weeks prior I had actually prided myself on how easy it was to fall asleep. I would lay flat on my back and relax every muscle in my body starting at my feet, and after a minute or two of relaxing I would be asleep. It was like clockwork. But suddenly, at the same time as the twitching started (as it's very hard to stay relaxed when it feels like there are worms under your skin), it was *impossible* to fall asleep - it would take hours every night.I went and saw doctor after doctor for the twitching, nobody was interested or thought it was a big deal - it was just "benign". I even got as far as Mayo Clinic, and they shocked and poked and prodded me and actually caught some fasciculations on EMG, but again, it wasn't a big deal. Nothing they can do.Around that time I met my now wife (who unfortunately is one of the biggest causes of stress for me right now, she has a *lot* of personal issues to work out including borderline personality, which I am more often than not the recipient of). She took many a prescription and introduced me into the wonderful world of ~~legal drug dealers~~ psychiatry. My psychiatrist was the first doctor who really seemed to listen to me, and put me on klonopin to chill and hopefully control twitching, and ambien to put me to sleep. And put me to sleep it did. Klonopin did help me chill but unfortunately it didn't touch twitching.Speaking of doctors, to this day they like to bounce me around doctor to doctor. Nobody wants to make a diagnosis, but everyone wants to see me. And as soon as they see "anxiety" on your chart that some dick wrote down 3 years ago it's all over. All your problems are now just anxiety.Over the years of architecture school, which sucks enough as it is, the insomnia slowly got worse. I didn't always want to be taking the ambien, but it did help. I could take it for two months and it would still help and give me a little buzz which I can't complain about. I never took it longer than that though.The modern story starts last june. I decided to try a "twitch tracker" where I would track my twitching of each individual spot against a series of variables in an excel spreadsheet. It included caffeine, water, nicotine, ambien, sleep, sugar, salt, protein, exercise, etc. probably about 20 things in total. I did not find any patterns for twitching. However I did find something interesting in my sleep patterns. Keep in mind at this point I was not taking ambien.I would sleep normally for the most part as my twitching was in one of its remissions. However, every single month almost to the day I would be awake all night - this had been the case since long before I started tracking it. Before long, once every two weeks I would be awake, and then once a week, and then literally every other day. I still, to this day, do not know what on God's green earth caused that wild decline into insomniatic hell. It got to the point where I would sleep 12 hours one night and then not for two nights in a row. In fact, if I was awake one night it would make it *more* difficult to fall asleep the second night, so if I was up all night I would know I was screwed. It's always interesting driving home from work at night after 60 hours on no sleep and thinking that the stop sign is a dude walking his dog, but like in the air above him. And his dog is red. Anyway -I got back in touch with my ~~dealer~~ psychiatrist (please keep in mind that this was an actual licensed psychiatrist not a drug dealer, I'm just making a joke about how easy it is to get whatever you want out of a psychiatrist) and was put back on 10mg/day of ambien. Worked like an absolute dream. I only have onset insomnia, so once I'm out I'm out, but getting me out is the issue.Two months later in September I have a full on epileptic Tonic Clonic seizure during my best friend's wedding. Wasn't breathing for three minutes. It was not a "psychogenic nonepileptic seizure", there were multiple nurses and EMTs in the family that saw the whole thing. Three big things here. 1: I was not drinking at all the night before, I was not sleep deprived, etc. It was totally out of nowhere. 2: I do not have epilepsy (we think I might now but we're still working on a diagnosis) this is the first time anything like this had happened, and 3: not breathing during a seizure is NOT the same thing as holding your breath. When you hold your breath for three minutes, you have a depleting tank of oxygen in your chest that you can pull from. When you have a tonic clonic seizure the first thing your body does is violently expel all air from your lungs and does not let it back in until it sees fit. There is no reserve tank. Brain cells start becoming effected in seconds and start dying in minutes.I wake up in the hospital, doctor thinks's that since I'm 22 and have taken benzos before (prescription and low-dose), that I must be a druggy who just had a withdrawal seizure. Bitch actually tried to get me into a rehab program. (spoiler: psychiatrist, neurologist, and epileptologist all said later that there was no way in hell that my dose of .5mg 2x/day would ever cause a withdrawal seizure).She then told me that I had to stay on the klonopin at the same dose and at the same time every day until further notice. You know, the exact *opposite* of how you're supposed to take it. Coming off a month later I didn't have any other *large* seizures but I did have a host of other symptoms.Personality changes, lethargy, double and blurred vision intermittently, balance issues, panic attacks (which we later learned today are focal seizures), constant vertigo and dizziness, wild mood swings, etc. All things that the doctors attributed to klonopin withdrawal, except the symptoms actually started immediately after my seizure - the one where I didn't breathe for three minutes and breathing was severely obstructed for the other 3. My symptoms were not from klonopin withdrawal - they were from oxygen deprived *brain damage*. Scary right? The good thing is that hopefully things should get better?What makes me mad the most is that it took four months to get from the ER to an epileptologist. ER thought I was a druggie so I had to pee in a cup, all of which came up fine. She then sent me to a standard practice doctor and a neurologist. SP doctor was understandably like "well what am I supposed to do with you?" to which I was like "just checking boxes on what the ER said to do."Neurologist said "Your MRI and EEG (not sleep deprived and on anticonvulsants (klonopin) - so bunk test) during it came back normal. I was fine, seizure was probably a fluke, symptoms are just anxiety.A week alter walking the dogs I get an aura for an epileptic seizure. I AM GOING TO COLLAPSE RIGHT NOW I thought, but I didn't. It passed. I called the neuro to say I just had a focal seizure, she says "let me know if it happens again".Two weeks later it happens while I'm riding in the car with my wife on a not-busy street in a low-stress part of town. *Massive* and *terrifying* focal seizure strikes and I once again thought "I'm going down, three two one", but it never happened. Called neuro again, and she said - I kid you not - Call me if it happens one more time.Guess what, it happened again. A month later (which is today) I finally get in to see epileptologist. He says he can't say anything conclusive, nor does he want to start me on preventitive medication in case it doesn't happen again (it has), and that we usually only medicate after the second seizure (has happened 8 times including the loss-of-consciousness full on seizure). Wants me to do 3 hour sleep deprived EEG (so basically re-do it the way it should have been done the first time).(right about now is when I start to get high on my 2nd dose of ambien tonight so my attitude may be more positive from this point on)In the midst of all this, from the seizure to now, I have been dizzy, dizzy, dizzy. Looking at carpets makes me dizzy. Looking at bright lights makes me dizzy. Watching water slosh around as I'm doing dishes makes me dizzy and like I'm going to faint. Found out at Opthamologist that he's seen this before after seizures - it's a mix of brain damage to the eyes and ears areas of your brain as well as the fact that during the seizure I strained the ever loving shit out of all of the muscles in my body including my eye moving and focusing ones. Hopefully it'll heal but it still causes a great deal of anxiety, since that kind of dizziness is part of my aura so I pretty much always think I'm having an aura.Oh yeah. So all this time I was taking ambien without thinking much of it. I just take it to sleep at night now as a routine, since I have other things to worry about I didn't give it much thought. A few weeks ago I noticed that I haven't gotten the buzz recently. Last week it failed for the first time and I was unable to fall asleep under otherwise normal conditions. Last night it worked but barely. Tonight it did not work. That is why I am now on here typing. I just took another one because I work tomorrow.I did not realize how out of hand the ambien was getting. I never took two except for tonight. I never took them ever as I was not supposed to. Because of it I would just go to bed every night and my brain would just block out the ambien the same way it blocks out you walking down your stairs every morning because it's so routine by this point. But tonight I may be on the verge of not sleeping a full night for the first time in almost six months.My ~~dealer~~ psychiatrist said that ambien tolerance was not an issue since it's in and out of your system so quick and my dumbass believed him. I was so proud for having conquered my insomnia that I just now realized how much bigger of a monster I have created. It's time to be done with the ambien.I am going to take it tonight (well I already have so I can't NOT take it), and I am going to take it tomorrow since I work Friday and I'm new as an architectural designer and actually really like that job so I don't wanna blow it. But here's my plan. friday night no ambien. Probably be up all night. Saturday no ambien, probably be up all night again. No way even me can stay up for three nights straight, should be good and somewhat reset by sunday night, and then only take an ambien if I'm not asleep after midnight on work nights. And on weekend nights no ambien ever. It doesn't work anymore anyway and it doesn't give me my buzz so what's the point? It's going to totally suck but between the twitching and the seizures that nobody wants to treat *which would take a load off as far as anxiety goes as well*, I totally forgot that I hadn't cured my insomnia, I had just blanketed it well enough for a short time. That sucks man. These next few weeks are going to be bad, but hopefully when I've detoxed from this - through all the pain and sleepless nights and anger and the "yeah I feel totally fine" at work, maybe I'll even come out better than I was before. Maybe the ambien itself is what's causing the brain fog and dizziness. Or the lack of ambien is causing it. I don't know. But even if it doesn't help me feel better at least with some time away I'll be able to get high off it again one day which is motivation enough for me. I'm gonna go to bed before this wears off. Everyone take care yourselves and don't miss the obvious things in life.Just like everyone else I love talking about myself so anyone wants to ask a question regarding the story as a whole or a specific part I would be happy to talk about it. Maybe talking through it all would lead us all to some answers because, if I do say so myself, this is approximately a fairly extensive story with lots to digest (that's not the right word I'm trying to find the word for when they open the frogs in biology class).Night all.TLDR Neurological juggling act, doctors have little interest in symptoms, drugs help, more issues for other things, drugs keep helping but you don't think about it anymore, other issues persist, drugs stop working, now there are more problems and you realize you done fucked up.
Signal	Not sure if this is the right sub for this question. I have no issue falling asleep, but I've been consistently waking up to pee after 3-5 hours and struggling to fall back asleep afterwards. Waking usually coincides with a nightmare/weird dream, not an urgency to pee. I'm not sure if having a full bladder is causing the nightmares or if the nightmares are causing me to feel like I need to use the bathroom. I've tried all the commonly suggested fixes, like cutting out caffeine, no screen time before bed, not drinking 4-6 hours before bed, listening to podcasts, melatonin, etc. and nothing works. I've tried trazodone and alprazolam and they didn't work either. I can't function well off of 3-5 hours of sleep and this issue is really affecting my life. I made an appointment with my pcp, but it's not until April. Has anybody else dealt with this problem?
Signal	I (20f) have struggled with insomnia since I was 11 years old and have probably gotten a total of 6 natural full nights of rest in that time. I use to be on medication that helped me with it but it stopped working and the doctors refused to give me something higher because I’m “so young and just need to put my phone down 30 min before bed”. I currently am living in a different state with my fiancé for his work and I just cannot sleep. I have taken the highest amount of melatonin I can, tried every other sleep aid possible and I can’t get more than maybe 3 hours. I can’t focus, I’m shaking all the time and it’s gotten to the point where he is now having to send me back to our home state so I can go see a doctor to get help. I feel so heartbroken, my inability to sleep is separating me from the one person I trust for months, how do I stop feeling so broken?
NotSignal	I don't know why but for some reason I feel so agitated I can't sleep. It's a weird mix of paranoia and irritability as my thoughts race and my mind fixates. I maybe shouldn't have watched BoJack Horseman before bed or had that caffeinated tea. I just want my mind to at least let me relax even if I can't fall asleep. It's times like these that I feel tortured.
NotSignal	Recently I've been waking up everyday after sleeping for only 5-6 hours, having to pee. After that, I am unable to fall back asleep. I don't drink a lot of water before bed. Has anyone else faced this issue?
Signal	...only to be horribly disappointed. I had a terrible night's sleep, worst I've had in about a month, two nights ago. But yesterday was an exhausting day so I was hopeful about being able to sleep. I spent the majority of the day outside in the blistering heat with my family (who are wonderful but also very emotionally draining). I got home at about 8pm already exhausted. I watched some YouTube in bed with my boyfriend for a few hours and found myself dozing off. YES. I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT. I fell asleep quickly but then found myself awake about an hour later. Hopes and dreams (literally) dashed. I fell back asleep for another two hours and then was wide awake. Spent the next three hours tossing and turning and feeling so immensely frustrated. I fell asleep again but, again, was only asleep for about two hours. And now I have to try to go about my day as if I'm not physically and emotionally exhausted. I feel so sluggish and irritable. I don't know why I'm writing this. I guess I'm just looking to vent my frustrations to people I know will understand. I hope you all had a better night's sleep than I did and I hope today is a good day for you all. As for me, I don't want to give up hope. I hope tonight will be better.
NotSignal	I slept a grand total of 2 hours last night, randomly, I’d slept fairly well before then. I fought to stay awake the whole day hoping I would get a good nights sleep if I could just make it to the end. After feeling like I was going to pass out in my chair I went to bed at 10:30. It’s now 2am, I haven’t slept a wink, and now I don’t even feel tired.
NotSignal	Three nights in a row with no Lunesta! I never thought this would happen
Signal	I only use mirtazapine, it has been a godsend, used almost non-stop since 2014. Tried stopping several times with horrible results, I have holidays for 1 more month so I figured now or never, one more try.It's 1:30 AM right now, I just saw Mad Max Fury Road, saw it in the theaters in 2015 but it seems cinemas are showing old movies now, since, you know.. was in a IMAX too, pretty cool. Gonna stay up the whole night, and I have tickets for an Interstellar showing at 10:30. And then Parasite at 14:30. And a World of Warcraft raid at 18:00. By 10PM tomorrow, I want to be proper tired. I can't sleep a wink without mirtazapine, so brute-forcing the first night by complete exhaustion may be very useful to teach my brain it can do it, if it wants to. I will report back tomorrow morning, wish me luck.
NotSignal	I sleep either normally or 2-4 hours a night for weeks straight i want to sleep and have tried everything I can think of. But I have a feeling my body keeps releasing adrenaline in a fight or flight mode. I keep trying to do the cbt-i thing. And normally it helps. But now that I am on 4 days nothing has helped. Hoping you guys might have a different idea.
NotSignal	Can worry affect your sleep? The virus thing is scaring me cause I have no immune system cause of my meds more so I’m worried about my son. I’m trying not panic but the last two nights have been hard plus I think my ulcerative colitis is flaring. I’m so scared for my son and worried...my GI office says they will not close and not to worry. I also have to go the hospital for my medications so that’s why I was scared about closing. I have to be on meds the rest of my life, I just hate myself and life right now.
NotSignal	I find myself getting back on track w my sleep when i go to bed 1-2 am, i get about 6 hours of disrupted sleep, but thats still good right.now the thing is when i try it at midnight or even earlier(Cause i feel tired) or 3am my sleep quality becomes trash and i barely sleep/ toss and turn all night.I've had huge issues with my sleep the past 6 weeks due to routine changes, i used to wake up 6 am and during this time it has become something in between 8 and 11am..&#x200B;Any advice is welcome
Signal	So I've been having this problem since I was like 12 or so (currently 17), unless I'm physically exhausted I can't fall asleep until 2 or 3am (even 4 or 5am last year)A couple of years ago I started having sleep paralysis and since then everything is 10 times worse, not only I cannot sleep but a lot of times I'm afraid of SP happening so I just stay awake and when I feel tired I try to sleep with my TV on (this prevents the SP) but it's extremely hard for me to fall asleep with the light from the TV but I also don't want to turn it off...you get the idea.Then I wake up in the morning at like 10am and don't feel rested at all, I just wake up tired and I'm a zombie all day and at night I can't sleep.The quarantine just made everything worse as nothing I do really makes me tired, for example the school routine really tired the hell out of me but now nothing comes close to that (wake up at 6am, finish the classes at 2pm, hang out till 7 8pm then take a shower and fell asleep at like 10 or 11), and the sleep was great but not enough as I had to wake up at 6am. So everytime I get enough sleep I can't sleep the next day and it's horrible, it makes me grumpy and really dizzy and tired. I just don't know what to do, I tried some pills last year and I didn't really see a difference, my parents yell at me every night for not sleeping early but it's not like I don't want to, they also say that I can't sleep because of my phone and overall don't seem to understand.Going to a doctor isn't really an option currently as I can't go for free without my parents knowing and I can only pay to see a doctor but I have no money for that. Honestly the sleep paralysis is the worst and terrifies the shit out of me and fucked up my sleep schedule even more. I also have nighmares or extremely unpleasant dreams almost every night. What can I do to at least fall asleep earlier? I haven't had some good sleep in over a month and nothing seems to help.
Signal	I think the worst part is I feel energized. Ive been laying in bed currently since 1am with no sleep (6am right now). Did the same thing last night and took a 2 hour nap yesterday from like 2p-4p. Its horrible. Probably most definitely a manic phase but im not really in a negative or depressed mood. Probably going to lay for a couple more hours than get up and make breakfast. RIP
NotSignal	Why when I fall asleep I have a twitch waking me up, it happens multiple times, not once, it’s my first time so wth?
NotSignal	Who here can honestly say they have successfully cured their insomnia from CBT-I?
NotSignal	Hi. I'm 13, I usually sleep around 6 - 7 hours but around once a week I get a bad sleep - like 3 hours. I let it worry me far too much. Try to live life to the fullest. If you've had a bad sleep, chances are that you'll sleep much better tonight. Don't look at sciency stuff and long term effects at 3am. Look, life sucks but the important thing is moving on. You can't let insomnia ruin your life. You're bigger than it. Also, your body adapts, it copes. More tips:-Do the Wim Hof method - absolute legend-Don't tell others about bad sleep, they may be overly concerned and make you paranoid about your own health-"Let the body do what the body is capable of doing"
Signal	I just got divorced so my sleep was already terrible. However, this pandemic has caused me to get barely any. Normally, I’m fine getting not much sleep, but now it’s like I have an attached fear to fall asleep. Idk. Does anyone else have an easier time falling asleep if you know someone else is still awake? Ugh. And I don’t want to increase my sleeping meds either...I’m so anxious being in this situation, in this environment, but for some reason when I’m tired I fight sleep still. I feel like I’ve lost all concept of time. Waking up at weird times and not knowing what day it is anymore. I just want to be able to leave the damn house.
NotSignal	I tried fixing my sleep pattern by staying up until the next night, but I can’t even sleep a full eight hours. What the fuck?
Signal	Since my father passed away 3 months ago I haven't gotten a good nights rest. I had trouble falling asleep before but now I feel like my health is severely suffering from whatever this disorder is. I'll usually go to sleep around 1am-3am, and I will wake up just about exactly 6 or 7 hours after feeling so exhausted. so exhausted that all my body wants to do is sleep, but my brain won't let me. So exhausted that I usually can't even open my eyes to check the time. But I still have the capacity to dream, they are pretty vivid dreams, but I am not sleeping. This will usually go on for 4 hours until I finally realize I will not be able to go back to sleep and start my day, feeling like I got 0 sleep. I don't know if this is more than insomnia because at least a few months ago I could actually sleep longer than 7 hours, it just took me more than an hour to get to sleep
Signal	I've tried everything. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to shut my mind up. The ruminating, the perpetual guilt over some failed interpersonal relationships, thinking about the many things I am not proud of. Everything is just a nightmare. Only difference is that I'm awake during this nightmare. I have NO clue why this is happening other than the fact that I am experiencing guilt and stress...I held a grudge against my father for kicking me out and he was sometimes difficult, so I ended up texting his gf all his wrongdoings. Big mistake. I regret trying to get revenge. I cannot sleep. I tried therapy. I have a psychiatrist. I have some mental health challenges. This lack of sleep is affecting my physical health and I cannot seem to rid myself of the guilt, sadness, and anxiety. I wish the pandemic wasn't happening. Someone please help me?Also, I tend to have songs stuck in my head at night, I don;t even listen to music that much anymore but I did when I used to run. I have my new work tomorrow and I don't want to go because i am physically nauseous
Signal	I have severe insomnia but my doctor doesn't like giving me meds. I only ever had zopiclone, mirtazipene (spelled that wrong), promethazine, and melatonin.zopiclone is the only one that ever works, and I can keep a sleep pattern with it, but I have none right now because I used it all up and I have no more for another week. promethazine only works if I take a lot, which gives me stomach pain so I don't want to have to use it.is there any other meds I can buy over the counter (like promethazine, I just say it's for travel sickness and I can get a lot) or any other ones I can try getting my doctor to give me?
NotSignal	I feel like as soon as I lie down I just become wide awake I csn feel my eyes aren’t as heavy.Does anybody have this?Is it normal insomnia stuff?
Signal	Just started buspirone and waking up panicking that I am going to die off cancer.... just want to Fucking sleep
Signal	So my psychiatrist put me on Hydroxyzine for sleep. Didnt do shit. Then he put me on gabapentin and it doesnt do shit for me for sleep. What do you think he will prescribe me next? I mean both the gabapentin and hydroxyzine arent specifically made for insomnia but im tired of taking these medicines that they prescribe just because a side affect of them is drowziness. Should I ask him to switch to Ambien or a benzo like Ativan? Any suggestions?
NotSignal	Guys do sleeping pills cause memory loss and cognitive problems and should i be worried if i take lunesta every day
Signal	I can’t find any medication that puts me to sleep benzos just relax me and otc doesn’t do a thing as a kid I was at the hospital and was injected with tranquilizer and it didn’t put me to sleep and I also stayed up on ambien too but I was very very relaxed. I desperately need help!
Signal	I have always taken ambien for my insomnia, all of a sudden I went to pharmacy and he prescribed me hydroxyzine hcl. This makes absolutely no sense to me.
NotSignal	Please, I need to know im not alone in this. I am so scared I cant handle this anymore
NotSignal	Sleep is weird... it’s like I’m struggling to stay awake when I’m reading and stuff and then when I try to sleep my bodies like, nope lol. I don’t get it. Last night I got like maybe an hour of sleep. Now tonight I’m struggling to sleep again even tho I’m so tired. Right now as I’m writing this I feel like I can pass out, but as soon as I put the phone down and try to sleep, most likely won’t be able to. Just took some NyQuil and I’m gonna turn on my sound machine to see if that helps. PS: I think it’s possible that my hormones are currently screwing my sleep over cause last week was going much better, then PMS happens and all of the sudden my body refuses to sleep? :(
NotSignal	I am a 17M who has been suffering from this for about 4 years. I go to bed around 12 and wake up at 5-6 in the morning, with an intense stomach ache and eyes so irritated that it hurts even if I close them. It usually hurts so much that I can’t go back to bed. I end up getting food and starting my day, which alleviates the pain somewhat. However, I am still plagued by fatigue and have no energy throughout the day.I tried talking to my doctor about this, but he brushed it off and attributed it to my diagnosed anxiety and depression. What could be the root cause of this?
NotSignal	Hey guys. Typically I don’t have insomnia (get hit with it sometimes, awful awful) but something wrong with my circadian rhythm where I am 100% alert at night and during the day I get sleepy. My parent says I’ve been this way since I was a baby. If left to my own devices I will slowly shift into a schedule where I wake up between 8 and 10 pm and go to bed at like 2 to 4 pm. I also function pretty good on a 3-4pm wake/5-8am sleep cycle, but it always slips later and later.I thought I hit the jackpot today by waking up at *9 in the morning* and managing to fall asleep half past midnight after taking a tramadol! ...Until I woke up at 3:30 am. Felt not TOO alert until I got up, went to the restroom, took 5mg of ambien to be safe... boom. Totally awake and now very very nauseated for some reason. :/ I have class at 1pm and am usually happy sleeping at like 6 am and waking up at noon, thought this would be amazing, I’d have so much extra time. Haw haw haw.I just can’t stay asleep at night. If it were daytime I’d still be out like a light. People don’t understand how hard it makes things, or how lonely you get being awake all night and out all day. Even my parent who TOLD me I’ve always been like this thinks that I can fix it by “”””just”””” going to bed earlier. No, I just lay in bed for hours until I give up. I’m so sick of it, I just want my body clock to work like normal. And when I DO get insomnia mixed in it’s a nightmare. I’ll be awake for 32 hours and wake up 3 hours later just wanting to cry. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get this off my chest. ALSO sorry if it doesn’t read well because I am still a little dizzy + disoriented from the tramadol. I’ll probably get a couple more hours *eventually*, but when you’re awake, it’s hard to believe it. Thanks for taking the time to read and hope y’all can catch your own sleep :(
Signal	I was getting the best sleep, most stable sleeping been getting in a while. Only problem was that it was inconvenient for me and other people because I'd tend to get my sleep in the middle of the day. so for the past 2 weeks I'd been staying up for 24 hours straight adjusting my sleep so that I'd go to sleep an hour later at a time (for example go to bed at 7 pm, then the next day 8 pm.) It got to where on the last day I'd been adjusted to a point where I woke up at 5 am which is a freak thing for me. Well, instead of being ready to take on the day having gotten 5-6 hours of sleep and awoken at a "normal" time, I felt more tired than I ever had in my entire life. It felt exactly like I'd been awake for like 4 days straight. Idk if anyone else get this feeling during 2-3 day sleep crisis-es, but I start to feel like my blood is just sitting heavy as a brick in my veins. Like it's near impossible to hold myself up anymore. More specifically there's this feeling almost as if my brain is filled of sand, or that theres some neurochemicals just tiredly sloshing around. I felt confined to my bed. I've been laying here for 3 days now because I just feel neurochemically fucked up all of a sudden. I think these attempts at "adjusting the sleep cycle" I've essentially been trying to accomplish for the past month and a half or more have caused some kind of neurochemical shift or imbalance. Basically I'm afraid I've trained myself to subsist and survive off these 30 minutes naps I've lapsed into a couple of times due to constantly trying to change my sleep cycle. Enough to stay alive but not enough to want to be alive.
NotSignal	Getting really sick of this. I read before bed, I use an expensive app for background sound ect ect with no luck. Tried to sleep at 10:30 last night didn’t fall asleep till 4am and ended up canceling my plans which would have involved being up at 7 and driving several hours throughout the day ending at 9pm on three hours of sleep so I was just like nah. I’m just so sick of this. Tonight I’m doing five miles before bed! Right now we’re about 2 miles in (my 3 yo son and I) and stopped at a playground so we’re going to take a 3 mile route home and hope it helps!
Signal	For a while I have had a bunch of trouble sleeping lately something weird has been happening. The best way I can describe it is that I feel like I’m dreaming my eyes are closed but I’m still like aware and awake. I can wake my self up an second and like in the dreams I’m aware it’s a dream. I lay down for hours and it feels like I was awake the whole night. Like I said I have always had trouble sleeping but up until the last year I don’t think I have a single dream that I woke up and remembered having.
NotSignal	Over the past 6 months my work life has deteriorated. This resulted in a culminating event on Friday the 28th. I have been racked with anxiety for the entire 6 months and this last cherry on the pie really was a kicker. On the Sunday following I had my first night of 0 sleep. The next nights I actually was able to sleep fine. Then I caught a cold on Friday the 7th and started some cold meds. (DayQuil and NyQuil). On this past Sunday night I had my current bout begin. I assumed it was due to the time change and stress. I had already taken NyQuil so I was a little surprised. Then it happened again on Monday night. Of course, like an asshole, I got on my phone and started looking up what happens if you have 2 nights of no sleep. Ding ding ding!!! I have won a free trip to terror town courtesy of Fatal Insomnia Syndrome. Then last night I did everything everyone says to do. I downloaded a between noise app, I drank camomile tea, I ate kiwis, I hugged my dogs. I get into bed with my phone far from me and... Nothing. The panic is seeing in and I could really use support. My experience is that right when I am on the verge of sleep the panic will set in and I will jolt out of it. I do not have a history of a lot of insomnia, and no familial history of Fatal Insomnia Syndrome.
Signal	first time poster here!I have adhd and take medication that, while it helps you focus, also prevents you go to sleep if taken at the wrong time.I am in currently in college and have a lot of friends who are night owls. To spend time with them I developed a bad habit. I began to spread out my meds so I could participate. Now my friends always go to bed at 12-1, but since I spaced my meds out incorrectly I couldn’t get any sleep at all. Many know how life can get busy. We get busy during the day and I developed an unfortunate habit of not sleeping at all.At first I ignored it, I told myself it wasn’t a big deal. But I failed to realize that I was becoming grumpier and less efficient at work.These last few days I have started to feel unnaturally dizzy and I won’t lie this has scared me. It was a wake up call (no pun intended).I am going to stop doing this right now and I am setting up a new routine. Tonight (and all nights after) I am pushing myself to stay awake until 7 pm. Then I will sleep and begin to set up a normal sleep schedule. No exceptions..However a part of me is really really scared. Did I do some permanent damage to my brain? Is that a real thing? Will this dizziness go away if I get sleep again?I understand that this isn’t directly related to insomnia but I posted this on a few subreddits so I hope it was ok that I posted it here too.PS: I already feel an immense amount of shame since I allowed this to happen. I was hoping people just keep in mind how sensitive I am feeling right now. (However I would never lash out anyone who wasn’t.)
NotSignal	Does anyone worry that this is their life forever?I’m wondering how people cope with this for years and years.
Signal	My anxiety isn't great and I'm struggling with cascading thoughts because my mind wants to go to the worst things right now. I've taken 2 melatonins and still can't sleep. God insomnia is the worst.
NotSignal	I'm 27, don't drink. Have had alcohol before, but didn't like it. Probably drank 5 times my whole life. I read that a glass of wine can help you sleep at night. Is it worth trying?
NotSignal	I sleep just fine during the weekends. It’s strange, as I don’t really see my work as stressful. I just can’t seem to fully relax when I’m supposed to sleep during weekdays. My sleeping pattern looks like this: I fall asleep around 11pm, wake up at 3am and I pretty much can’t sleep after that. During the weekends, though, I can sleep from 10pm to 7am. Wtf
NotSignal	HelloI knew this was a thing, I just found out what the name of this is, polysomnography.I am curious if anyone here has been through this, and what kind of information you got from it. I am kind of done listening to GPs or psychiatrists and psychologists theorizing about things. I should note they are not sleep specialists. Due to my "sleep" pattern, I am disqualified from the regional sleep center, as it actually requires people to sleep (GP's words).My goal would be to have actual evidence of something, good or bad, so I get a better understanding of, or if, there is something different or not.I am diagnosed with chronic insomnia. I'm not looking for medications, I just need measurable information I as to why I am this way.My "doctors" are really not informing me very well, and due to the insomnia, my physical and mental state is not compatible with appointments in regards to literally anything. Cancelling appointments are drain on the economy (there is a fee regardless of reason), and due to COVID-19 restrictions, transportation cost is also a burden, due to location and place of existing.Anyone been through PSG, what did you get from it/not get from it? Did you get more questions, if so, what kind of questions. I have lots of questions, but I don't really know what to ask about.Please share your experience, the good, bad and the ugly. Thanks in advance.
Signal	I'm 14 and my body has been deciding for like 2 months now even when I have class to be fully awake. I'm going to go insane if I cant sleep I cant remember the last time I had a night over 6 hours of sleep. Any advice?
Signal	I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but at the moment I am having issues with my energy levels due to insomnia.This is due to my screwed up sleep schedule. During quarantine and my 18 credit classes, I ended up staying up later than I should have which ultimately made me get used to a night schedule and led to me developing insomnia. Since school is over, I am not up at those hours anymore. The result of this is me being uncomfortably tired, to the point of almost passing out.Until I fix my sleep schedule, is there any way to wake myself up throughout the day? Note: caffeine makes me tired, so I can't take energy drinks, drink caffeinated teas/coffee, etc. Mints tend to wake me up a bit, but I don't wanna eat mints all day
NotSignal	Does anyone else get this? It most frequently happens when I try to dose off during the day after a night of hardly sleeping. What happens is that I can feel my body finally in that "transition" from waking to sleeping, and suddenly my body just rejects that notion and wakes me up with a powerful adrenaline rush, like the one you get if you're startled or scared.Sometimes I even get into the sleeping stage, but only for brief minutes. I go straight into REM dream mode, and my body "zaps" me out of it. I feel so miserable right now. It's like my mind is begging for some rest, but is sabotaged by my own body. And no, I don't think it's apnea because this happens as I'm dosing off, when I'm still aware of my breathing, not to mention that I don't snore or anything.Can anybody please relate to this? I haven't had a decent night of sleep in more than a week now. Been taking Ambien for 3 days now, and it doesn't get me anything more than 4 or 5 hours of very unrefreshing sleep. All this makes my SFI fear go into overdrive. Please help. I just want to sleep in peace!!!!
NotSignal	Thank you for being a friend. If it wasn't for this show I would go absolutely insane at night.
Signal	6th night of no sleep it’s unbelievable how my insomnia got to me it by a long shot has to be in the top 20 worst cases to ever exist... theres no way someone could live any kind of healthy even somewhat any life!!! It’s drained me and stripped me of everything please anyone know about insomnia that could help me?!?!?!!! Maybe even give me some tips to overcome this PURE AGONY!!! Someone please help!!!!!!! (I’ve got in here in the bathroom and fucking farted which I went ahead and was sitting on the toilet in fear of this one being solid and hard as a rock. No flutter, just a pretty good noise! BOOM!) But seriously any help would be so appreciated right now. I need your help!!!!!!!!
NotSignal	What are common triggers that can effect the sleep schedule of someone’s insomnia? Was wondering because I’m a writer who has a character with insomnia and they are going through a breakup. Would a breakup be enough to keep an insomniac awake at night or would that not be possible.
NotSignal	I have been sleeping gorgeously after cutting out coffee. Well I was stupid yesterday and had an americano. Did not get a single wink... & work starts in 2 hr. Fffff insomnia. Even though I’m so tired I know I have to skip coffee this morning. Work is going to suuuuuck
NotSignal	I feel like crying...it has been 3 days since I slept for 3+ hours. At the moment I feel extremely sleepy but I've been tossing a turning for 3 hours now with no progress.
Signal	My whole life I've struggled with insomnia, and I occasionally take a sleeping pill (benadryl, melatonin, sleep aid, lunesta) which I've found does help me fall asleep. However I've heard that its unwise to consistently take a sleeping pill as the effect will wear off.However, what if I were to rotate through a different sleeping aid every night of the week, that way my body wouldn't get too used to one type of pill.Has anyone tried this? Could there be any merit to the idea?
NotSignal	Everytime i go on vacation i cannot sleep, like ar all for days on end. I’m writing this at 7 in the morning haven not sleepen 1 min. I’m afraid this will continue for the rest of my trip and i don’t know how to relax my brain, or what to do anymore. When i go to bed my mind starts going in this fight mode with sleep where i try to much to sleep, and try diferent techniques to go to sleep and it just doesn’t come naturally. Please i need some advice. Thanks!
NotSignal	The strategy that i use when i lay down and my mind can't stop thinking and racing about everything, and every detail of everything is: i search the colour black in every thought that i have and "dive into it"Example: im thinking about soccer, i just think of anything that is black on the scenario and "zoom" into the black, wheater is the uniform of the team, or just the black part of the ball.When i zoom into the black part of whatever it is that im thinking, i get into this "black universe" where there is nothing. Where i can control my thoughts easily and clean my mind of thinking, and just focus on the colour blackIt's not easy to explain, and as i said, i am not an insomniac, still a human tho, and as a human i can't sleep sometimes, and that's what I've done for my whole life.I hope i helped someone! :)
Signal	Around two weeks ago I began not being able to fall asleep. I proceeded to be up for around 3 straight days, and then slept ~5 hours. Since then I have been prescribed Trazadon in which I took 100mg for one week. I began sleeping 4-5 hours a night but felt horrible during the day. My doctor told me to take up to 150mg but I never did.I called my doctor back and he prescribed Termizapine. I have taken that for the last two nights and only slept 2 hours a night.I’m starting to lose my grip and wondering if anyone has any advice. I’ve attempted meditation, limiting phone and light exposure at night, CBD and valerian, reading before bed. I can fall asleep but then be up often in one hour.I feel like time is running out. How many days can I go on like this and what broke? I exercise regularly get plenty of sun and am in good shape. I have great parents and a supportive gf. But I am losing my life. All I can think about at night is my heart beating.I haven’t tried meditating enough, only a random session here or there. Is there a more effective medication that I can at least take short term to sustain myself? Should I up the Trazadon dose to 150-200? I’m 160lbs. Or, should I take more than 15mg of tirmazapine? Would 30mg knock me out?I haven’t tried CBT because I’m fearful that I won’t last long enough to even fulfill the program. I can not keep sleeping 2 hours and sustain. Thank you so much for your help and compassion
Signal	last night i got 2 hours of sleep last night. ive stayed up all night for the past 2 weeks and im literally so tired but no matter how tired i am i cant sleep. i stood awake till 3 last night and i drifted away till 5 and i just laid in my bed till 10. it may be small but its something
Signal	My head is pounding.My eyes are tired. My nose is clogged. My mind is racing.My body is almost not in pain. Been up since 2:30 am and its about 5 am now.Woke up twice before then.I can't seem to figure this out. My body forces me to sleep at the end of the day only to constantly wake me up in the middle of it. A lot of the time it hurts to wake up in the morning. Most of the time now, I wake up with a headache.My only comfort is the thunder and pouring rain rn.
NotSignal	Like seriously I hate Christmas.And a dooptey Doo, a dickery dock and don't forget to hang up your sock. Cause just exactly at 12 o clockHE'LL BE COMN DOWN THE CHIMNEY DOWNFuck I hate this make it stop
Signal	Hi,I really have some sleep problems. I mean 4 hours a day, \~5 hours when i don't have to go anywhere, because i am able to force my self to sleep for 1 hours in the mid day.It was gradually harder and harder for me to force myself to ***fall asleep*** , however If i would fall asleep i could still seelp until i naturally wake up and am full of energy... What is happening now is that its not that i ***cannot fall asleep***, it is also that i cannot actually sleep, i wake up after 3-4 hours and i feel tired, as if i want to sleep, but i cannot fall asleep... It's so crazy...It actually is a little scary to me, the moment i realized that i am not falling asleep not because i do not want to sleep, but because of something else, that doesn't allow my brain to sleep.At the moment i feel very drunk, dizzy and tired, i booked a doctor appointment a week from now, will see if i can get something figured out... But until then i need to stay productive, have a job to go, exams to prepare, interviews to prepare for.
Signal	A few months ago I posted in here about losing my job due to insomnia. It was a kinds crappy time. Been averaging ...under three hours a night? for 18 or so months at that point. I actually went to the Grand canyon at the end of February and hiked for a few days. That was the first true relief I've had. And slept well until last week.Got a job working 70+ hours at a warehouse. Which is great for my brain, it needs activity. But also brought back the insomnia... So fuck me. Averaged 3 or so hours the last 8 days. Kinda pissed off. Hoping my brain readjusts... Anyhoo. Just wanted to give a brief insomnia update.
Signal	Having anxiety and hypnic jerks is a killer. It’s very annoying that every time you fall asleep you wake up due to your anxiety. I’ve lost five hours of sleep. What do I do?
Signal	Hi,Since I was a child I have problems falling sleep. When I go to bed I spend minimum 30min, normally 1h and sometimes 2 or 3h to fall asleep. I don't really know what a siesta is. Tried but never got to sleep.The problem is that I must sleep at least 7h30min, better 8h. Otherwise the following day I can't focus properly, all day long feeling dizzy, the feeling is like having a swollen brain. This happens when I sleep less than 7h30.I take melatonin. 4 pills each night. If I still can't, I take another 3. I have been doing this, this way, for years. When I didn't have melatonin it was nearly impossible, always 1h30, 2h maybe bored at bed. If I really can't sleep then I take zolpidem tartrate, 2.5mg (half a pill). I appreciate this pill really works, but I am scared of getting used to it so I just use it like once or twice a month. Sometimes more, sometimes less often. I am afraid of travelling, because whenever I travel away is like having to kill myself, being all day long feeling dizzy, grumpy...i always carry with me my pillow wherever I go, but I can't take it if I take a plane. The pillow helps, but it's not the same in any sense. I have eye problems and I have every screen very dimmed. So I don't use filters. My wife can't barely see anything on the screens I use. I also go to sleep every day at the same time and I try to get up at the same time, even on weekends. Sometimes I wonder if a circadian rhythm of for example 30h would fit me. For sure I would feel more tired. But responsibilities like work wouldn't let me try, among other things. The thing is that a lot of people feel like that, feeling that so bad but only sleeping 3 or 4h... Why do I feel so terrible all day long even sleeping 7h? Worse if I sleep less. But still is like throwing my entire day to the bin. Since I have memories this has been like that.What do you think? Is this normal? What would you recommend? I live in Spain, 26M. I have checked with the doctor sometimes and it would simply give me pills. They help but I wouldn't like to take them all my life, for sure it will develop some other problem in the long run, along with addiction. Would you search somewhere else? I also read a book about a guy which was a football sleep trainer that recommended a lot of things..I also have been using ear plugs for over 5 years. And wearing a night mask for over 10. Thankfully I sleep with an air conditioner so I can close the windows and the shutters so no light and no sound can disturb my sleep.Thank you for reading until this point. You must be a good person.
NotSignal	I feel horrible. I'm just sitting up on the couch trying to distract myself at this point. Everything is so bad. I take melatonin, remeron, and nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm going to die like this.
NotSignal	After suffering for years with terrible sleep, I finally went all the way from last Tuesday to this Tuesday with 8 hours of sleep a night. Its been such a difficult journey but it is possible to beat insomnia.What worked for me was CBT-I guided by a coach via an app It took a full 3 months of sleep restriction and cognitive changes to get here. I also changed my lifestyle to be more active and to ensure I caught some sun every day. I run for 20 minutes every day now and feel tired when I go to bed.
NotSignal	I feel like my mood dips significantly once I’m about to sleep unless I smoke weed, which I’m trying not to depend on too heavily as it starts to add up in terms of $$$. I just don’t want to continue dreading going to bed because knowing sleeping will be tough w/o extensive help from substances is really affecting my mental health at times. This is probably a stupid question to ask here but any tips on how to stress less? I’ve given up on making sleep easier, I just want to stop beating myself up for it so much.
Signal	A while ago I got put on some pharmacy grade sleeping pills, they are amazing, they put me out for 8 hours within 15 minutes. Anyway, after a couple months of taking them, I figured I could probably do without them last night. I spent 7 hours tossing, turning, half asleep, and just straight up not having a good time. If you have sleeping pills, don't try to go without
Signal	I just got Ambien...and it didnt work. I'm not sure if I have Fatal Insomnia. I havent been getting any sleep whatsoever for over a week, literally ZERO hours. Benzos arent working, Seroquel, Doxepin, Weed, everything. If there is no solution, I'm going to drive over the border, buy a gun and off myself.
NotSignal	Thought I would be able to get some sleep today before I’m forced to work my 12 hour overnight shift but over course my anxiety and depression consume me. My boyfriend is sleeping peacefully beside me while I can’t stop shaking and crying. Any ounce of tiredness I has is gone. Even if I can... I don’t want to sleep. Somehow my anxiety is telling me I’m gonna feel worse when I wake up and I should just stay up 48 hours and work.
Signal	I have suffered from insomnia for about 15 years. It was getting to the point where it was disabling, and it seemed like I tried everything. To make a very long story short, what ended up working for me was making brief notes on what I did every day, what I ate, how I was feeling, and how many hours I slept every night, and putting on an Excel spread sheet. I started to notice that when I ate sugar, I couldn't sleep. If this is you, do an internet search on "sugar insomnia". You'll find some interesting articles about how cutting out sugar and carbs plus no snacking between meals can improve sleep. As I understand it, this won't work for everyone, just those of us with endocrine anomalies.Let me tell you, I love bread, rolls, and desserts drenched in sugar, but I absolutely don't love them enough to endure sleepless nights. It's a great feeling when 10 pm rolls around and I am actually yawning and sleepy! I still occasionally wake up in the middle of the night, and if I can't sleep after 20 minutes I get up and read or meditate until I feel sleepy. Here's a list of some of the things I've tried: Ambien, Sonata (these are prescription drugs and both of them left me feeling hung over plus they didn't always work, and then my new doctor absolutely refused to prescribe them again when I started grasping at straws - doc, if you're reading this, you were right), several different brands and different doses of melatonin (no discernible effect for me), bright light in the morning (no apparent help), blue light filtering glasses at night (helped some), valerian which someone told me "works for everyone" (zero effect for me), running for 30 minutes everyday (I thought this was THE cure for awhile, but there still were some nights when it didn't work, and then I tore some cartilage in my knee and had to quit running on my Orthopedist's advice), dark shades in my bedroom (helped some), CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - helped somewhat). Cutting sugar and carbs with no snacking between meals works almost all the time for me.
NotSignal	I go to bed at like 9 then wake up at 3:40-4:00, and judging by some of the posts on here that's not bad at all. I've always thought I've had horrible insomnia but idk now
NotSignal	When I don’t sleep in my bed, and sometimes when I do, I get a tingling sensation throughout my body, mostly my legs, along with restlessness, increased heart rate, and racing thoughts. WHY?!?!Drugs don’t even really help...
Signal	Has anyone had this happen to them? I was prescribed melatonin to help me sleep and I just had one of the worst sleeping nights possible, I woke up two hours into sleeping and from 2 to 5 am I was tossing and turning in bed half asleep then I managed to actually fall asleep at 5am and woke up at 11 I've been dealing with insomnia since I was a child but it just seems to get worse
Signal	Does anybody else get extra anxious before bed? I’m not scared because I think I’d die in my sleep but it’s like the thought of *trying* to fall asleep always seems like a task or brings out this strange anxiety / paranoia every night.It’s hard to explain the ‘scared to fall asleep / scared to try to fall asleep’ concept I have but it’s something that my therapist mentioned to me that felt 100 % correct.My insomnia has been at its worst during quarantine. Sleeping a few hours if I’m lucky nightly but also pulling all nighters 2-3 times weekly.
NotSignal	CBT-I is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia. The NIH, as well as most of the leading national and international health organizations, recommend CBT-I for ongoing (long-term) insomnia, over medication. You have to get an accreditation to lead a patient through this therapy. It involves the patient heavily documenting their sleep routine, reviewing it with their therapist, and then going through several weeks of retraining the brain on how to sleep. This includes learning about how sleep works, good hygiene practices and some sleep deprivation to get the sleep routine back on track. Note that this summary is high-level and there’s much more to this therapy. I went through CBT-I over 10 years ago. I recall that it was successful at first, but I couldn’t maintain it for the long term. I’m at a place in life where I think I’ll be better able to adhere to the routine, and also I have less real stressors (outside of the existential threat of COVID and new economic realities for our world!).Somly is (I think) the first/only virtual CBT-I program available. You meet with a sleep specialist once a week for at least 6 weeks, while completing some online work, like watching videos and filling out a sleep log. They guarantee 100% satisfaction and will work with you longer than 6 weeks - at no extra cost - if you are still having issues sleeping. The cost is around $350 for the entire program. You can request a free consultation; someone from Somly will schedule a call with you to review the program and let you ask questions. Let me know if you’ve tried Somly and what you think. I’ll also share my experience after I’ve completed the program.
Signal	Ive had insomnia for abt 4 years now due to a trauma.. and lately i feel like im losing my skills? For example my memory is shot.. i cant understand as easily as before.. sometimes i forget how to move something in my body.. i cant even spell sometimes cuz i forget how a word is written.. im losing both languages im fluent in! Im scared this will last as i want to get into medical school and it would mess me up. Its gotten to the point where ive forgotten who i am and i rediscover myself every week! Is anyone else feeling this way?
Signal	I've had insomnia my whole life but for the past year it's gotten to the point where I can never fall asleep anymore. I am constantly wired and I have taken multiple kinds of medication with no effect. Sleep paralysis is also an issue and I feel like I am just going to die soon for long I've been awake for which feels like months now. I have also already done a sleep study and was told that it's just depression but I really don't think that's the case either since I've have depression for years now as well, which this was never a problem before up until last year.
Signal	I slept 9 hours last night my heartbeat is back to normal but my anxiety is still horrendous and I feel tired. I was given 10 mg citalopram again, even though I know it makes me feel like shit. I don't even know what to do at this point. I'm on so many medications and they make me feel like utter shit and my parents won't let me go back to bed because I want to reset my circadian rhythm.
Signal	I'm having shiftsmoved around and cancelled and though I'm enjoying the freedom, I just can't make myself sleep. I've tried eating less and drinking mroe water, being active (within reason because of social distancing) and keeping my mind busy until bed time. Breathing, sound, abstract thinking.. Nothing puts me out lately and I'm beginning to get so messed up. Every time I have a half decent sleep I either get woken up by my girlfriend too early and can't resleep, or she wakes me up 16 hours in like "oh btw your alarms went off", and my cycle is now off sync with my work hours. I mean it isn't her fault but jeez.. I'm getting upset at not being able to do something so good for someone trying to fix themselves <~
NotSignal	I just want to see if anyone else is going through a similar situation rn because boy does it suck.
NotSignal	The problem with sleep for me is...How do I fall asleep?Like I'm pretty good at staying asleep but the problem is how can I fall asleep because when I sleep in the day it's incredibly easy to fall asleep and I remember how I fell asleep.But when I want to sleep in the night it doesn't feel right or the same.Are there any good ways to fall asleep quickly?
Signal	My doc and I have been working together for over 4 years to find something that actually works for me. I’ve seen sleep specialists and gotten nothing from them. I’m 26 now and for the first time since I was 13 I’m getting a proper night’s rest. I’m so immensely grateful, it’s hard to express. My insomnia has been the leading cause of pretty much everything that’s gone wrong in my life; school failure, lack of stable work, my depression and self-harm, my wildly fluctuating weight which has ranged from 67kg to 101kg in a 6 month time frame, forgetfulness, paranoia... etc etc.Despite my own relief, I cannot sufficiently express my sadness that there are so many people who continue to suffer; I know only too well what it’s like and my heart sincerely hurts for each and every one of you. I hope everyone here one day finds their own relief. Please stay safe and take care of each other.
Signal	Lately I’ve either been not sleeping. But then sleeping too much but that’s because due to lack of sleep I get exhausted and just knock out. Also trying to get rid of the big sad. I took these melatonin candy pills whatever from GoodDay chocolate and it worked pretty well, unlike the otc brand which didn’t help. But i might have taken too much cuz chocolate.
NotSignal	It’s 5:50am here and for fucks sake I’d like to sleep.
NotSignal	Its 4 am rn, and as much as i want to go to sleep, i cant, because my head is filled with a noise of thoughts, which cant let my brain slip into its "entering sleep phase" routine. It kinda feels like a cloud of mosquitoes: you cant make out individual ones, but they are around you, and they are NOISY. Its like all thoughts and ideas play at the same time, and even though you are thinking them, you cant grasp any of them. How do you deal with that??
NotSignal	Long story short- military with some slight PTSD and a couple things going on in my personal life right now. Ever since I transferred from an operational unit I've had issues sleeping once every few weeks or so- I'll get a couple hours for 2, 3 days straight.It's getting to the point now where it affects me at work and I have an appointment with a psychologist and then likely a psychiatrist after.In any case, last night I tossed and turned all night and got maybe a wink for an hour or so a couple times, max. What do you guys recommend I do today while I'm chilling at home? Relax, try to nap, don't try to nap?
Signal	Hello,Couple of months ago I had one sleepless night, no idea exactly why but it happened. Since then my sleep habits have degraded big time.I've been trying all kind of recommendations I've found on the net about sleeping hygiente, but so far nothing has made a big difference. The only think that kind of made me improve my sleep again is stop trying to do things different at night. This means no yoga at night or mindfulness to relax, no hot nor cold showers before bed, no Linden tea, no before bed walk, no switching computer, TV and phone two hours before bed.. at some point it felt I had to do a ritual to go to bed and I don't think it was helping at all.From all of it the only thing I kept is no TV or computer at least for one hour before going bed and not even my phone 30 minutes before bed. That's the only thing that's working for me most of the days.The problem I'm finding with stopping using screens before bed is that I try to read a book and I end up nodding off on the couch. Which is good that I seem to be able to fall asleep but by the time I went bed last night for example I felt I had already lost the momentum for sleeping after trying to keep myself awake to read and go bed later.How should I handle this? Should I go bed right away after I start dozing off while reading even if maybe it means going 5 minutes after stop looking at a screen?What do you guys do to wind down at night before bed? I'm thinking of just leaving some jobs I do in the afternoon to be done before bed, that way I can be busy doing them instead of noodling off on the couch and forcing myself to be awake.But then, doing jobs before bed doesn't sound like winding down...I'm very tempted of taking the approach of going back to where I was three months ago with my sleeping hygiene. Which means having none. Maybe just improving the not using my phone in bed but stop worrying about what I do before bed. I think it makes everything worse to be honest.Cheers.
NotSignal	I had a lab done that showed nearly all the tryptophan in my system was being converted to quinolinic acid, causing inflammation and serotonin deficiency. So my thought is 5-htp might be helpful as it can only metabolize to serotonin, crosses BBB & is highly bioavailable. Google claims its helpful. Anyone have experience with this, has taking it daily helped you?
NotSignal	I used to get up to pee all the time at night and I could not sleep it was terrible...I changed my diet I stopped eating and drinking sugar all the time and this week my sleep was a lot better...best in years. If you have really bad insomnia and you have a very poot diet like I used too...try changing your diet maybe it will help like me..my insomnia was terrible and now it's not perfect but it's a lot better.
NotSignal	I didn’t find any posts about it, but I honestly wondered lately why am I getting sicker than most people during the year..Is it just me?
NotSignal	I had experienced it last month but only for a few days. But this time, I'm going on 3 full weeks averaging 2-4 hours of sleep. This week has been the worst. I am extremely depressed and just sad because I want to go back to sleep. But it was bound to happen.I have general anxiety but it was largely controlled. It never got out of hand. But lately, I've been a shitstorm. I had an incidence where a large but crawled across my face. I'm a man but I hate bugs especially big ones. That shit woke me up out my sleep every 2 hours because I kept having a huge bug issue. Turns out they were coming in from outside, sneaking in as they hang by the bottoms of the door and I live by ALOT of trees. So they are busy this time of year. Never the less, it gave me huge anxiety because 4 times I've had them way too close to comfort so I would wake up every 2 hours thinking Something was crawling on me. It got so bad that everytime I would doze off at night(they appeared at a certain time)I would immediately wake up because I thought I felt something on me. This is where my anxiety began.No. 2, health issues. They were all minor but fear of them being something else had me just on edge. And it got worse and worse until I had palpitations. Huge sign that anxiety is growing out of control.The last 2 weren't issues until as of late. Dreams. Powerful dreams. They woke me up every 2 to 3 hours but I could fall back to sleep in minutes. Maybe an hour. And then these resurfacing emotions for my son's mom. We separated 2 years ago but NOW the process has hit me. Now I feelthe regret, sadness, anger and disappointment. Id never act on these and never have because we have to co parent. But the fact that they arose now and so powerfully was all I needed. This is the timeline for April to mother's day.So now, as you can see, this was inevitable for me. Excessive worry started to break my sleep pattern. I began subconsciously responding and reacting and this completely froze my desire to sleep. Add to the fact that my sleep was broken up by anxiety of other things, you can see that this is where I was headed. Now I wait patiently. I don't believe in meds. Reddit and y'all are my therapy. I've accepted that my son's mom has moved on, long ago and these are repressed and outdated feelings I'm feeling. Drinking won't do much. All I can do is identify each emotion, confront it and let it process thru my body, my heart and then my mind. It's a purification process. I've worked myself up and today was the worst day. So now I must allow myself to calm down by first identifying. Next, letting this hold run its course. I did this by waking my own self up so now I have to wait for the reprogramning to complete itself. It takes 7 days to form a habit, 21 to break it. I believe this. So now I must thug this out until it's done. Just gotta relax and let anxiety run its course. Just a thought and a vent sesh
Signal	Its 5:00 am I want to sleep but I am wide awake!! I just took Valerian Root earlier in the evening I had 6 mg of melatonin and 7.5 mg pill of Zopiclone. Will it be too much If I take 100 mg of ZzzQuil?
NotSignal	Can someone talk me out of thinking that I possibly have sFI. Yeah I know it's basically a meme here with these sorts of posts. This all started in April for some unknown reason I just started having issues sleeping and specifically lost the ability to recall dreams. The amount of time I've been sleeping has gotten less and less. I've been utilizing CBT-I and sleep hygiene. I've been through countless sleeping meds and aids, both otc and prescription including the big guns like seroquel. I go about 4-5 days of no sleep quite ocassionally and end up having troubles speaking and processing things that i'm watching/doing. My walking has felt weird but the only time I feel a little bit alert is if i'm exercising otherwise i'm in a constant state of feeling like i can fall asleep but not able to if i tried that also feels dream like. I see things that arent there after the few days of no sleep. I have troubles showing emotion anymore. this took me some time to write out as i can barely type i have tremors in my handsI tested for OSA and USA both of which turned out normal. I have to wait 8 months-2 years for an overnight sleep study. I just need someone to tell me that this is just what everyone else goes through not too sure how much longer i want to do this
Signal	I have been taking both ambien and clonazepam for my insomnia (and I know they are both bad for treating the underlying disorder, providing restful sleep, and can cause rebound sleep problems worse, individually let alone together, so I don't want to hear about that) but recently my restedness is considerably worse so I think I want to wean off of one of them. Out of the 2, which one gives yall worse quality of sleep?
NotSignal	It’s 2:41am here and I’m feeling fragile and fallen apart. Been having depression for almost a year now. Went through a phase where I would sleep for 15 hours a day and went through another phase where I would stay awake for the whole night staring blanking at the ceiling. Been having sleeping problems for my entire life. Averagely takes me 2-3 hours to sleep, if not 4. Waking up in the middle of the night tossing and turning. Waking up in the morning with a massive headache. Could not sleep for the entire night for no reason and feeling detached from the world the next day. I can’t remember how much advice I’ve taken from everybody who I’ve asked. Winding down earlier in the evening, do meditation, do exercise, deep breathing, listening to soothing music, read a book, refrain from any electronic device that emits blue light that could disrupt my circadian rhythm, do not do any work that requires strong focus of the brain in late evening...I couldn’t remember how hard I’ve tried and how much effort that I’ve put in just to complete a task as trivial and banal as sleep which most people wouldn’t have trouble with at all in the first place...I feel like I’ve been punished for something that has not been known to me for my entire life so far. I feel sorry for myself, and I pity myself. Who the hell am I after all? Am I even worth anything?Been crying so badly as I think about ending my life almost every single day. I’m usually the most vulnerable when I open the window blinds at midnight and I peer through the window and I see everything’s so quiet, so lifeless, and I want to be part of that without a soul noticing me. Fortunately the windows in my apartment could only be tilted to a very small degree and I couldn’t even get my arm out. Been thinking about sleeping pills. What will they do to me? Will I get addicted to them? If I’m using them for better sleep this time, what would their use be the next time? I would never know, and I’m scared.I am scared, and I’ll keep being scared until I find a solution to this.
Signal	Does anyone else feel with their insomnia their living in constant torment ?? I feel like I’m living in hell not able to sleep and I can’t cope anymore.
Signal	hey guysso i was on celexa for 2 years and i guess i must be dumb i seriously didnt think about it but i cold turkey it 3 months later, i now have horrible cripple anxiety 24/7!as im going trough withdrawals ( can last months) and like a dumbass i though it was return of anxiety instead ofwithdrawals so went back on celexa super fast so i have double whammy, now just taking it everyday for stabilizing. will be longanyway i developped severe anxiety insomnia aggravated by the spiked anxiety of my ssri history, i worried about sleep all day all nighti can go night with 0 sleep often. it started when i went 3 days without 0 sleep and then 4 days at one point. it has put my life on hold right now.basically my brain is thinking about negative orrandom stuff 24/7 and cant focus.only thing that has given me back my sleepis 2 x zopiclone 7.5. it make the next day much easier as i can rationalize more.i was wondering if it would be worth it to take it daily while i go trough all this, because i dont think i can handle it otherwise to be honest.the benefit seem to outweight the negative right nowand yes i tried everything, sleep hygiene always been on check, meditation daily, magnesium, cbt you name it. seeing a therapist also
Signal	I've been stressed AF lately and it's been exacerbating my insomnia. I have been taking deep breaths in and out the last hour and its been helping. Dunno if it will help sleep, but I hope you all find it helpful.
NotSignal	I’m wondering what would cause one to hit REM and wake up within 20 minutes? Is this a sign of sleep deprivation? I also had a bad concussion two days ago and since then am waking up every hour. Any tips and tricks to get through a full night with rest would be much appreciated.
NotSignal	It’s also even worse when you just haven’t been doing well so the entire time you’re lying there, your mind is racing for hours about shitty thoughts regarding insecurities and stupid hypotheticals.
Signal	The best way to describe the constantly tightening chains on my life that make up my sleeplessness isnt "non 24" 'nighttime anxiety' 'RLS' "Sleep Anea" etc,.... the only accurate way to describe what I experience is cognitive torture. ***Cognitive**** because while I feel somewhat physically tired and pulled back by my sleeplessness, mentally i feel completely dazed, drained, dizzy, almost even thoughtless or incapable of thinking. Like a zombie. It feels exactly like if a toy continued to be able to move around even if the battery is dead. I still try to read and apply my mind on the days when I get at least 3 hours of sleep, but it's been scarily rare to get just that lately. I've had years of becoming a non functioning person due to sleeplessness but it's never been this bad. I'm not able to do anything with my life. Not even talk to people or really notice anything in my surroundings some days. Today after a string of nights of getting 2 hours, usually both being separated by wake ups and then trying for another hour, but (the) last night I got at least 2 hours without waking up and then another 1/ 1/2 3 hours later or so, I got out of bed (I also always make sure to stay in bed in the dark for at least 8 hours even if I dont sleep, to at least try to slightly trick my brain into getting some rest or replinishmnet) and was just in the worst daze I'd ever been in. The sort of limited cognitive functioning someone who's overworked has been and they come home and just zonkily starebat the tv times ×100. And that's all I was capable of doing. The presence of others, even a pet would annoy or fill me with anxiety. All i could muster the mental strength to do was watch tv.That was my day pretty much. I wish I at least had a distinguished of insomnia such as a non24 because then I'd be actually capable of sleeping at all, just at inconvenient times. I'm lucky to sleep at all. And then when I get lucky its 4 hours(split in two by a 2 hrs wakeup). Most nights it's 0-2 hrs. This has never cognitively weighed on my heavier. I do my best to at least the the wheels turning slightly when I can, but theres definitely been a very sadly noted cognitive decline
NotSignal	it really doesent matter if its important or not, the sun and stars them selves will fucking shift in order for me to miss that damn appointment. its annoying as hell on top of good ol fashioned insomnia.
Signal	I can't stop crying, I need to sleep, mentally and physically, but I can't, I just can't no matter what I do. Last night I didn't get to sleep at all, not even a wink, and the night before I got 3 hours of sleep. All I can do with a straight mind is self harm. Does this classify as insomnia? My parents say I'm fighting sleep on purpose.
NotSignal	Hey I wouldn’t consider myself an insomniac cause I do sleep sometimes full nights, but it just sucks when it’s 5am in the morning and you have to work a 7am and you haven’t slept all night really need someone who understands. Sometimes I end up crying but then I get a headache I know it sounds stupid.
Signal	I don't know what's wrong with me and I feel like I need to reach out for some advice.Awhile ago I had an episode of sleeplessness and anxiety that led to me spending 3-4 days being unable to sleep comfortably and panicking about my percieved 'inability to fall asleep'. After sleeping on the couch for a few days after often leaving my bed in frustration, I found that I was able to slowly train myself to fall asleep in my bed again, and I returned to sleeping with ease.However recently, I had another sleepless night that is causing me to become fixated on sleep again, and I feel as though these thoughts are consuming me during the day. I normally go to bed at 1:30 AM and wake up at around 6AM but even though my family members tell me I was sleeping because they could hear me snoring, nothing anyone says can seem to give me assurance and allow me to be convinced that everything is okay. This often leads me to spending my waking hours being consumed about thoughts related to my sleep and the difficulties I'm having, which often leads me to falling into a pit of googling about insomnia and sleep disorders. Does anyone have any advice on how I can regain my sleep confidence and eliminate these thoughts so I can sleep normally?
Signal	Since this quarantine there has being a week where I (18M) was Going to sleep around 3 or 4 am and wakeing up at 2pm.... last night i had a all nighter then slept from 8am till 2pm now I am stuck struggleing to sleep and I feel exhausted with a headache :(My mom blames it on video games to....
Signal	Ok so this has been ruining my life the last 3 months. Every time I fall asleep my legs or arms jerk so I wake up instantly. I also get the Classic hypnic jerks sometimes.This i pure torture.It started after a major stressful event in my life. I also tried a low dose iron supplement because I had symptoms of deficiency and RLS sometimes. It was very stupid because i found out later my ferritin was 220.Could the iron have made this? Caused a brain damage from neurotoxicity? Far fetched? I also ate Iron rich foods at that time.Could it be plmd/rls? Just because of stress? The only thing that works a little bit is benzos. Pramipexole doesnt work.Neurologists say that this is stress and doctors just gives me melatonin, quetiapine, mirtazapine and paroxetine.Paroxetine made it worse. Mirtazapine gives me rls and quetiapine just makes me tired and calm.Suggestions?
Signal	My insomnia comes and goes every few months. Where i would be fine for a few weeks or few months to having a really bad case of it from outta nowhere. Each time it comes back it comes back as a whole different type of animal. Sometimes i can only sleep for a few hours or even minutes, sometimes i will wake up very half hour, or others which is total insomnia. I have tried CBT-I and medication but never stuck with any. The insomnia that recently came back is the total kind where when I'm about to enter a sleep i would jolt awake due mainly to hypnic jerks but even when i ignore those my mind is relaxed but i never drift off. I've been awake for 40-48hrs now not feeling sleepy just fatigued and tired. I tired resetting but nothing.&#x200B;Is there anybody else that goes through this where their insomnia comes almost seasonal most times without any trigger? Also CBT-I never helped at the moment of sleep is there anything i can do to exhaust my mind when going to bed? How do you deal with extreme hypnic jerks? I've tried meditation but is there any other methods to enter a sleep ready state before bed? One last discussion question. Do you guys feel it's better to stay in bed when u can't fall asleep or get off the bed and do something else until tired? disregarding any sleep hygine or CBT-I tips and just basing it on personal experience.
NotSignal	But having a good night sleep for me is a bittersweet feeling because I know it'll be a good while before another one comes along
Signal	This has lasted for way too long. Well over two years possibly longer.I just want to sleep. That's it. I just want to be well rested and have energy but my body won't allow me.What do I need to do, exactly? Avoid reading information that makes me upset? Have a consistent workout routine? At this point I'm willing to do anything I need to.Zzzquil worked okay but I worry about taking meds regularly.But it's pissing me off when I go to bed with enough hours to constitute a good night's rest and my body won't cooperate. I don't understand why it's doing this to me and I just want it to stop. I'll overhaul my entire lifestyle if that's what it takes.
Signal	Does anyone have experience with doxepin? I can hardly sleep at all anymore and my psych doesn't do much about it. I want to ask for doxepin as I hear its non habit forming, but I wanted some opinions and experiences before I recommend it to the doc. Thank you!
NotSignal	I've read that you shouldn't. But literally, I never get tired until my brain is exhausted. It's 3.24am now and I'm not sleepy. Just physically fatigued.If it's okay, then I plan to just take melatonin every night. It just works, so why not! Obviously my damn brain isn't producing enough of it...
Signal	Hi! I really don't know much about this topic but this month I can't sleep well. I can't sleep until its 5am and sometimes I just can't do it. When I sleep around 5am I wake up around 5pm. My sleep schedule is wack I don't know what to do? What are the effects of sleeping 5am in the morning and waking up around 5pm?
NotSignal	I lurk this place for a long time now. Even tho i don't really consider myself to be an insomniac, (in the literal meaning of the word) i sure do have sleep problems since a very young age. Starting with age 10 i stopped sleeping well at night, only to sleep during day. At 11 and 12 i was staying awake almost every weekend and school break. My parents never had control over my sleep, and even if they put me to sleep in my room with nothing to do, i would still be awake. Don't need to say it was a torture for me. At a certain point of my childhood i started pretending to be sleep, just to anyone else go sleep and i can be awake and alone. Then, at morning i would go to school and i would be sleeping the rest of the day. Now, it was not so bad at this time, i usually had long periods of good sleep in between this things, but as i grew older it got worse.In high school i embraced this. I continued to be awake at nights, going to bed by force when i could but most of the time i was switching night for day. Since i became i teen tho, i started seeing good things in night. I loved the night time, i enjoyed it and i felt so much energy to do anything. I studied, played games, read books. Also, i started to notice that when i was not switched, my days were nothing like that. I felt tired and sad every time and i could not bring myself to do anything meaningful, even if i had a perfect good sleep time. High school ended and i started to work, and my first work was at night. Even if it was shit, i was as always energetic, i used to go home and still do bunch of stuff that i would never do in daytime. And now, in college im worried. Since the COVID outbreak started i had more time with myself at home, and started to pin down my bad habits. This one can't go away tho. I made an effort to stay awake during the day and sleep properly at night, but even if i do it i cant help but feel dead the days afterward. Im also noticing that i have surges of depression during day, often between 1PM and 4PM, and im desliking sunlight to the point i rather just close my windows. So, in your opinion whats happening to me? Can i be saved? Its 3AM i just woke up from a try to fix my sleep, but it was no use. I just slept all day as often and now im here. I will see a doc when quarentine is over, i think i took long enough. TLDR: Since kid i usually did not sleep right at night, but rather i would sleep during day time. It progressive became worse as i aged, and i noticed how energetic i feel at night and how i hate be up during the day, feeling surges of depression and desliking sunlight. What do you think? Anyone with the same problem?
Signal	I'm at my wits end,so much so I'd be willing to take a date rape drug to sleep. Don't know much about the effects of it except it's supposedly 10X as strong as xanax and valium, which is a big plus in my books
Signal	I'm 26, I've been taking mirtazapine for a year now, before that I had to take olanzapine for insomnia (totally unnecessary, thanks doc!) for a year as well. I find myself spacing out/daydreaming a lot, thinking about useless stuff mostly. Several times a day I lose my train of thought too, and yesterday I forgot where I put my cellphone THREE TIMES because I was too distracted by random thoughts.This might be a permanent side effect of olanzapine but it also might be an effect from Remeron, since afaik both drugs have sedative effects, and I imagined at least a little improvement after a whole year without APs, but it's not happening and might be worse now.So I'm thinking of tapering off, lowering from 15 to 7.5mg. Anyone who's used this drug, does this make any difference? I've read that between 7 to 15mg induces the most sedation and that higher doses make you more alert. Should I expect the sedation to decrease or to increase after taking half the dose?
Signal	made a huge lifestyle change to move to a different city. saw a nurse 3 times to try and get ambien switched to the doctor because she apparently can’t prescribe it. saw him 3 times before he threw antidepressants at me which i had horrible experiences with. he claims ambien is too addictive then throws lexapro and trazadone. none of these helps and i have horrible side effects. he doesn’t take me seriously and i took these years ago. ambien saved my career because i was able to hit my rem cycles. right now i’m struggling like hell to sleep. i am an anxious person but calmed down a lot after practicing bjj and exercising 6+ a week. i’ve however been struggling with insomnia for YEARS after stopping ambien. right now it’s really bad because i’m in a perpetual cycle where i’m getting anxious at my job due to learning and performance difficulties from my shit sleep.are there alternatives to z pills/ ambien? i’ve exhausted all OTC meds and refuse any psychotic/antidepressant meds. anti histamine prescriptions don’t do anything. i’ve tried weed which helped a ton but caused brain fog which i believe is due to the rem disruption. can’t believe this doctor i’ve seen him 3 times begging for help and he’s making me go throguh the pill game and he’s claiming he doesn’t like to scribe ambien because it’s addicgive...
Signal	Here I go again in the middle of the night! Hi I'm ihateapple and I have a problematic sleeping problem, I can't sleep.its hard for me to function at school or at home because I would always be awake. I have tried to stay awake and force myself at night but barely getting a few hours. I am worried for when I go to highschool because I would have to focus more and it would be more difficult for me now. I was wondering if anyone has advice. Toodles! -ihateapples
Signal	Idk where to begin, Im a male 23 years old my birthday is on Friday. I have sleep problems, my girlfriend just left me because she doesn't have feelings for me anymore. I hate my life... I had plans on proposing to her (she didn't know about it) but I have not talked to anyone about proposing to here to anyone, and that hurts... I've loved a girl so much that I was willing to go and ask for her hand... And I get dumped, in the worst time. I have an exam I haven't sent in from UNI, my birthday has been missrable for the past 10 years, my girlfriend left me and told me she hasn't had feelings for me since 3-4 months back, I've been having mild paranoia, really really bad dreams. And I'm at I point right now.... I don't even know what to do with my life. I don't know why I'm writing this here, but I hope and wish and beg and pled to God that no one... Feels this pain I feel right now. I hoppe the one who read this are good and safe and I just wanna say I'm here for you. I'm sleeping but I wake up every 1-2 hours from having nightmares. Sorry for the bad English by the way
NotSignal	I have insomnia since february and today I noticed that my heart rate is higher than it normaly is. (Between 89 and 107 bpm) I’m not a very active person so normaly my heart rate is between 70 and 77 bpm. I should had that i’ve not felt anxious during the day, maybe a little bit tonight and right now (because of sleep anxiety). Should I be worried?
Signal	So I go to bed at 11ish but it always takes me an hour to fall asleep. Then I wake up at 3 or 4 am and stay awake for 2-3 hours. If I'm lucky I can go back to sleep for an hour but otherwise I'm awake from 4am. How do I stop this morning insomnia I am very depressed and i need advice. Thank you!!
Signal	I went to a doctor who specializes in insomnia. I felt like it was the biggest waste of my time and money. I’ve seen countless doctors, tried what feels liek every medicine out there, had sleep study done years ago. So I’ve been trying to fix this and was hoping for some real help being as he specializes in this...He told me I spend too much time in bed...uh okay? I typically try to go to sleep around 9, but spend hours trying to actually sleep. Till I cave and take medicine. Right now I’m currently taking 4 Benadryl- that usually doesn’t start to even help for at least 2 hours. Wake up at 7, work and repeat the cycle daily. He claims I need to take my medicine at 930, get in bed at 1030, wake up at 6. No laying in bed before 1030- and get out right at 6. This was all the advice he gave. Told me to follow up with him in 6 weeks. I waited 5 weeks for an appt with him, all to be told this. So fine I will try it. And guess what? It didn’t help haha! Has anyone been told you similar and actually had a good outcome?! He says 7.5 hours in bed no more. Did he think him saying this would magically make my body listen!?
NotSignal	Am I the only one who treats a lack of sleep as self harm? Like, if I’m overwhelmed or emotional, I force myself to stay awake because the “high” feeling of being tired makes me feel numb. It started off because I used to get panic attacks before bed, so I tried to put off sleep for as long as possible. But then I started doing it to punish myself when I got emotional Am I the only one who does this?
Signal	I LOATHE Tamazepam, as it only knocks me out for about 4 hours while the side effects are pretty severe (grogginess, tiredness, memory fog, poor muscle coordination, etc).Due to some prior nerve pain, I have lying around some Gaba (300mg caps) , Nort. and Naltrexone.If you could avoid taking Tam as much as you could, which would you take for anxiety induced insomnia?
NotSignal	If you haven't tried it, give it a shot.BUT IMPORTANT NOTICE:if you are medicated in anyway that already interferes with Serotonin, don't. The reason behind this is the Serotonin Syndrome, I could go ahead and explain it, but hey there is Google.
NotSignal	Has anyone actually found anything to help insomnia. Im really at breaking point. Even with meds i get hour and half if im lucky. I know i have cronic pain aswell but god damn there should be something to help. Unless anyone has a sledgehammer to put me to sleep?!
Signal	I can't fall asleep nor stay asleep.I'm constantly tired, exhausted from this sleep deprivation.My head is rushing when I'm supposed to sleep, so I try to distract it with calm music/stories, no sound is a no go.I take olanzapine (unsure of dosage right now, too tired to get up and look) and melatonin at least 6mg per night - still sleepless.I drink calming teas, I take my meds on time... What more can I do? You know that feeling when your body is so tired, but your mind too busy rambling nonsense? This is nonsense I'm writing, feels like poetry to my tired mind.
NotSignal	Reasons for insomnia can be so absurd. Currently up because whatever side of my head I lay on “falls asleep” after a few minutes making my face tingle. Don’t know if normal or some sort of sign of something worse. Life has been so hectic lately. Sleep was the only way to get away from it all. Hopefully that doesn’t get taken away either. What causes yours? May you all get some sleep tonight.
Signal	I'm just getting tired of this nightmare of not being able to sleep that well. I'm always tired now got dark bags under my eyes from this constant sleep schedule, I wish I was able to sleep at a normal schedule but now I cant,. This had all started because of my sleeping habbit. I wish I had my sleep. I wish I can get out of this nightmare. I wish I can just force myself.I wish I that I can go back and not stay up, I wish that I never made this habit of sleeping around this time. I wish that I can sleep. Thank you for coming to my ted talk/rant. I hope you sleep well. Cheers, Ihateapples
Signal	I've been awake for about 52 hours at this point, so about 3 days i think, and i just don't feel tired what so ever, and going to bed just results in me turning and rolling around in bed for an hour before i give up, i haven't had any kind of coffee, cold shower, or anything to keep me awake really, but im starting to get worried this isn't just a case of 'trying to stay awake', thank you.
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for about 8 months now and haven’t gotten a normal nights sleep in about 3. These past 2 weeks in particular have been horrible, getting 3-4 hours of sleep INTERRUPTED. I can’t sleep during the day either and I feel like I’ve lost the ability to sleep or even feel tired. I’ve read so many things about how just one night of no sleep is equal to 6 months of eating pure shit and I just wanna know what anyone knows about sleep deprivation like this and developing things like diabetes. Would it take like years? Is the damage reversible? I’m pretty young and have been in great health until all this happened and I’m so worried about it going down the drain due to this.
Signal	So I can never sleep bfr 4-6am like ever I tried Lit era lly everything but when I do sleep i sleep like 14 to 17 hours it's not a sleep schedule problem bcz I've tried many times to stay awake till the next night and slept at 8-10 but I always end up staying awake no matter how tired like my eyes are literally swollen rn and its 5:46 I'm exhausted but cant sleep and when I do wake up I have 0 energy for anything like I can go months without moving a muscle? Am I insomniac or just hella lazy lol
NotSignal	Just found this sub after not sleeping a single minute last night. This is normal for me about three times a week. Hellish. When I do sleep, it's not peaceful, broken by bouts of waking, and at odd, erratic hours.Glad to be among people who get it.
NotSignal	It's 4:15am couldn't sleep till 1am I've got an exam tomorrow 1pm and got a lot of things to read...how to calm this fucking stress down...many thousands thoughts and stories and blah blah come to my mind it's suck coward that fears to face a normal exam tomorrow....if I sleep now I should wake up on around 12am an study till end of day just want productivity and focus tomorrow nothing more that exam is important to me any tips?
NotSignal	So yesterday I accidentally took a big whoof of air from my trash can in the restroom and now I can’t sleep. Every time I try to sleep, I get hypnic jerk. Is this anxiety or do I have fatal insomnia?
NotSignal	Anyone else have a single beat or word of a song on repeat? Last night, it was 'On' from for the longest time.
Signal	As a child? teenager? adult?Once i became 21 i started to develop anxiety and then since then i have had an impossible time sleeping no matter what i do. i used to be able to take naps and sleep effortlessly.
Signal	Hey! So I have chronic insomnia and It’s due to something called delayed sleep phase syndrome where my circadian cycle is basically effed up... so I have to take a pill to reset my cycle. Problem is, I have suffered from binge eating in the past and idk what it is about zopliclone, but I basically black out and fall asleep (yaAaAY) only to find ice cream wrappers, Nutella, and lots of other sweets beside my bed. Keep in mind, else than these episodes I eat whole foods only 95% of the time bc I have a high genetic diabetic predisposition. Does anyone else experience anything like this? Like a blacking out episode where they do shit they normally don’t? I woke up this morning and I had some tabs open on my phone from last night searching up hospitals and if you can die from eating too much... must’ve ate a lot lol
Signal	sometimes when there is nobody near me (most of the time because my sister is in uni) i start hearing hallucinations at about 1:00 to 5:00. all of them are just repeating my name until shouting and then cute nicknames from people i hate or my dead family members.insomnia sucks.i can’t sleep even if i want to.i just took so much meds.i took valerian, cough syrup, and kid sleeping pills with vitamins.this sucks and nothing ever works and nobody believes me except my grandma but she doesn’t realise how severe it is. i probably didn’t sleep properly for about 2 months until now.i can’t deal with it sometimes.i don’t even get dreams.
NotSignal	So my question is, will I be able to function and talk to customers all day on 1 hour of sleep?
NotSignal	Man my mind, my body - everything just goes crazy at night. I have eczema which always gets more itchy at night. It seems my capacity to feel tiredness fades, which is the exact opposite of what happens in the day time. I’m restless, my mind keeps going.Why this shit happen all the time?
Signal	It’s almost 10 in the morning and I was trying to sleep just about all night. I took sleeping pills, got in my comfortable position, but I just ended up deep in my thoughts or staring at the wall for hours before I just gave up and scrolled through Reddit. This is not the only time I’ve had this happen, sometimes my body just literally won’t let me sleep. I’m frustrated at myself at this night in particular because I have to get groceries in 15 minutes.
NotSignal	So i watched the whole documentary of Jeffrey Epstein on Netflix. Couldn’t sleep all night last night. Myself i have been sexually assaulted, not by him but by other people. It stayed in my mind, i couldn’t stop thinking about it and i can’t cry. I will try and change my mind today but i have never stayed up all night except from one time when i went to Europe. Tonight im taking sleeping pills cause the case just haunts my mind. Am i okay?? Has this ever happened to anyone and what can i do ??
NotSignal	I thought I had another sleepless night but I remember a dream that I had and I can recall it. I don’t actually remember going asleep though as I remember it I was just lying there doing nothing. The last time I recall being awake was 4:30am and the next time I checked my phone it was 8pm. I also heard that you dream during REM sleep if that’s true then that is very reassuring because I thought at first that I may have had a total sleepless night.Also, I’m going out with my friends today for the first time since the pandemic began and would like some advice on how to survive the day after having little or no sleep.Thanks!
Signal	I haven’t been clinically diagnosed with insomnia, but my inability to stay asleep for more than 2-3 hours at a time shows I have some kind of sleeping problem. Anyway, I keep (nearly) falling asleep throughout the day. In my lecture hall, sitting in my room, at the library, on break at work. One time I almost fell asleep driving which scared the hell out of me.Anyone have any advice?
NotSignal	Insomnia as I believe it to be is much less a disorder and more of a selective evolutionary trait. Affecting so many yet not an overwhelming majority, I have trouble not only with sleep cycles, but with sleep during night time hours. Be it anxiety or deep introspection. My body prefers to sleep during daylight and I do believe its more than a disorder. I believe there is a darwinian precedent. Living in tribes our ancestors would sleep much better knowing atleast 1 member was awake during night and can keep watch. For the greater good this behavior was rewarded, the ability to reproduce, those who failed at night duty resulted in the tribes demise, or their own personal demise when this failure had consequences for the tribe. Eventually somewhere in our genome a trait for prefering daytime sleep developed and was only expressed in some offspring. I could be wrong, but I don't think I am. I have and can sleep during nights but my instinct strongly prefers not to. This conclusion may have been reach elsewhere before me but I think this maybe the place to bring it to light.
Signal	Haven’t been able to get enough sleep for the past month or so. Today I thought I was gonna get a good nights rest but once I got to my bed my mind started racing. I can feel my heart pumping and I keep having to get up to pee. I can’t help but think of all the bad choices I’ve made in life thus far. I went to bed around 9:30 because I was super tired. It’s currently 2am and I’m still trying to go to sleep. I feel so irritated. I need to wake up early and I have a long list of things that need to be done. And I keep stressing about how I’m still awake and won’t be able to get through my errands with a rested mind and body. I’m a 23 yr old female. I used to smoke a lot of weed and did a few drugs here and there. But I’ve been clean since the start of lockdown. I keep overthinking things and I would just like to fall asleep now
NotSignal	I find when I've had consistent bad sleeps of say 4 to 5 hours with a middle of night wake up I usually have better energy levels in the day as opposed to 7 or 8 hours. I'm not sure if this is due to waking up in the night (maybe this works for me) or just my body is best suited to lower amounts of sleep.I've had this for decades. I remember backpacking in Italy when I was young, I wrote on my diary how I was getting such wonderful full sleeps but was "still tired" in the day. Health wise, according to docs, I'm perfect.
NotSignal	Jus type if u wanna play something cause my non-ability to sleep is causing me too play games so much so jus comment if u wanna play some I got gta r6 and fortnite (r6 & fortnite I have to download) so jus comment and we can play ✌️
Signal	I take medication to sleep.. some nights I can sleep 3 to 4 hours in a row then I’m up n can go back to sleep for like an hour then other nights I’m up every 2 hours during the night ... 🤷‍♀️... most likely anxiety
NotSignal	For the past week I keep dealing with these problems can only get any amount of sleep after being up for over 20 hours. I called my doctor and they seriously just told me to google good sleep hygiene but I feel like this problem is more than that. I feel like my life is on pause, I feel like shit every day. I can't think worth a fuck, I keep struggling to find words and put together well formed sentences and realized ideas and I feel like I'm just dragging through every day.
Signal	I have a neuromuscular disorder called cramp fasciculation syndrome.Because of it I am unable to sleep more than 90 minutes without fully waking up, then having to get up out of bed.I can go back to sleep after around 15 minutes or a bit longer, but I wake up again in approx 60-90 minutes.No matter how tired, or sedated with valium, or what time of day or night.This is mostly due to muscle stiffness, cramps and 24/7 non stop twitching in my feet.This has been the case since january 2019 after several months of worsening sleep.The symptoms are often worse at rest, and as far as I'm aware continue unabated while I'm asleep.I usually need a nap late afternoon and have several up to 90 minute "sleeps" during the night.I feel like I sleep lightly and wake easily, and I never feel rested after sleep.Does anyone else experience this kind of broken sleep, and if so is there a proper name for it?Also does anyone know if this type of disturbed sleep has any negative health consequences long term?The syndrome is possibly permanent so I may have this sleeping problem for good.
NotSignal	it's been days since i've had a decent sleep.pills... tea... meditation... nothing helps.when i do finally sleep, it's like i'm still awake.anybody else relate? this shit blows.
Signal	I'm no longer getting sleepy enough to sleep from my antidepressant. I'm still more tired than prior to the pill. I just don't get that exhausting feeling when I'm going to sleep.
NotSignal	Maybe a bit specific:I've been able to fall asleep like a normal human being for about a month now, after getting rid of a lot of stress at work and life in general.Now, when I drift asleep, my breathing slows down and I get a panic reaction to it and instantly wake up again feeling scared. It feels like I stop breathing, and I instinctively gasp for air(I don't stop breathing, I think).Anyone else experienced this?I've never noticed this before, since falling asleep have usually been me passing out after 20-ish hours of being awake. Really weird.Almost like I'm subconsciously scared of falling asleep.
Signal	I’m on day 2 or 3 of barely sleeping and I am so exhausted. I feel like it’s a never ending cycle of not sleeping, taking caffeine to wake up, and then not sleeping again...I have a lot of work to do but I feel mentally and physically exhausted. I can barely sit up or keep my eyes open.It sucks because the lack of productivity does impact my mental health. When I’m just sitting or laying around all day, my depression kicks in. An ideal day for me is getting work done, doing yoga, going for a walk, exercising, and doing little things around the house to keep my space nice. But when I don’t sleep these tasks seem impossible.What works for you? Do I try to nap, or drink more coffee...
Signal	Four Nights in a row without an hour of sleep. I have listened to meditation music started taking trazodone, took deep breaths, have done everything to try to sleep, And I get nothing but more anxiety every day. It's 1:58 and I have shortness of breath and even attempting to sleep gives me heart palpatations. I don't want to live like this. I need help,
NotSignal	Hey guys,For the past 2 weeks I have had nights where I got no sleep. I have never experienced this before and am worried that this might start to become a habit. Any suggestions or tips?
NotSignal	I've been an insomniac for some years now. Everytime I think I'm done, I get another bout. I'm going through one right now. So I thought I'll lay out some tips I usually give myself. Frankly, this is a diary post.1- Attitude is #1. The more I complain and freak out about the idea of lost sleep, the worse my sleep is. Stop catastrophizing. 2- Get things done. I know I'm tired. I know I'm cranky and irritable. But I can still do some things. I can pick up a couple of household chores. Clean up an area at home. Go for a short walk. Just don't let insomnia completely define me.3- Stop coming up with weird reasons as to why I can't sleep. It's not my pillow, it's not the weather, it's not the coronavirus. I have sleep anxiety. And I need to stop feeding it nonsense. Accept it and prove it wrong. Sleep is possible. I've done it before.4- Wake up at the same time everyday.Just because I used to be able to sleep whenever and wake up just fine in high school doesn't mean that's still the case. I need to stop ignoring sleep hygiene and stop saying it doesn't apply to my problem. 5- Eat better. No more junk at night. Have some herbal tea at night. Stop spending so much time in the same place. 6- Nobody owes me anything. Just like I don't understand another person's illness, others don't understand mine. I can't let my sleep deprived mind give into irrational anger. Stop getting "jealous" and angry about other people sleeping.I've found that the more upset with insomnia I am, the longer it hangs around. So I'm trying to detox my bad thoughts. Not easy, considering the lack of mental clarity that comes with sleep deprivation, but I won't let that deter me.
Signal	I've always had trouble sleeping but lately its gotten even worse.I've been trying to practice sleep hygeine. I usually shower at around 730 put on pajamas and read a little bit and try to be in bed by 9 and read for about 20minutes or so. I try to be asleep by 1030 but most of the time am unable to sleep and not being able to sleep gives me anxiety so unfortunately I end up staring at my phone until around 3 or 4 am to distract myself until I can barely keep my eyes open and I end up with about 4 hours because I seem to automatically wake up at 6 or 7 AM and having a miserable day, and its a vicious cycle.I'm really a homebody and this covid stuff and not working has really worsened my insomnia. I've started excercising about 3 days a week and I still can't get a decent nights rest.I've tried melatonin and it doesn't work. My doctor gave me a prescription for temazepam and it knocks me out, but I don't want to be dependent on it.I really need help. Can anyone please offer some help? Tips? Ideas?
NotSignal	Today from 00:20 - 1:15 I had an audio hallucination and I wondered if that's normal. My friend said it can be due to the lack of sleep so I wanted to ask if anyone else had something similar? Or is it normal if you have insomnia? Thank you in advance
NotSignal	As the title says. This whole mess started about a week ago. Started waking up middle of night after sleeping about 4 hours then falling back asleep and sleeping another 3-4. Then in Sunday it happened again only this time I didn't fall back asleep. Here we are two days later and I've gotten 2.5 hours of sleep total. Nothing today, me and the wife went to sleep at 1030 and here I am at 730 in the am still awake. Feel like I'm going crazy, Everytime I shut my eyes my mind races, music in constantly playing in my head. Just want to sleep. I'm getting over Covid 19 now, I'm actually on my way to retest now to see if I can go back to work (work at the hospital). Might reach out to my doc and see if he has any input.
Signal	I'm having insomnia and anxiety. I am quite sure it's my insomnia causing my anxiety and its feeding each other. (Catch 22). I'm still waiting to see a psyc, the waits about 2 mths. My GP has prescribed Fluvoxamine which I am very afraid to try as it has a tendency to worsen insomnia which will inturn worsen my insomnia.Anyone took Fluvoxamine and it actually helped your insomnia/anxiety?
Signal	I drank a 3rd of a bottle of (absolut) vodka and the night before I took 4 (10mg) ambien because I took one and didn't fall asleep fast enough so I took another and then I started hallucinating and I don't remember taking the other two but there are two others missing so I guess I took them too.Basically if I take another ambien tonight will it kill me. I'm not trying to die because Ive just paid for another month of anti depressants and I don't want to waste that. Also prescribed zoloft and seroquel (both 25mg) taken 1 zoloft and 2 seroquel over the last 7 hours
NotSignal	My mom walked in to wake me up at 9 AM, was proud I was “already” awake.I never slept but hey I’ll take the positive comment
Signal	If I went with Klonopin and it didn’t work, how long should I wait to take Ambien since the two can’t be mixed?
Signal	Woke up at 11pm, took 1.5mg eszopiclone with 5mg melatonin, 1am comes around and I’m still awake, take another 1.5mg of eszopiclone, now it’s 2:30am and I’ve just taken 50mg of quetiapine, that better do the trick. I should hopefully fall asleep by 3am and get three more hours in before I have to be up at 6. I just hope I’m not a zombie at work. Hope everyone slept well
Signal	I have a bad case of insomnia for the last 10 years. I was checked throughout and prescribed all available pills over that period of time. Pills help but only for the first month or so. So the only thing that works is NyQuil but I heard that I can damage my liver permanently by taking it regularly. Any opinions?
Signal	Hey all,I have spent the past 2 weeks getting a good night of sleep, then a really bad one. Finally, during the midst of an anxiety / panic attack I went to the ER at 330am. I gave them my history and told the doctor about my sleeping problems lately and told her I've developed a fear I have a terminal disease known as fatal insomnia. She brushed it off, but I keep convincing myself various things happening to me are this disease. For example, after my ER visit I finally fell asleep around 9am. I then slept til 330pm which then my wife woke me. I then fell back asleep at 730pm and slept nearly 12 hours. I remember dreaming and didn't lay awake hardly at all, but now today I am super groggy and anxious again worried its this disease. How can I force myself to stop thinking I have this? I am still very groggy today. For medicine she started me on Paxil, Hydroxyzine (as needed) and Trazodoone. I took all 3 before bed last night. Could it be that causing my drowsiness / grogginess?I'm just so scared this is something terminal. I keep getting anxiety attacks about having this disease.
Signal	Hey I don’t normally suffer from insomnia but ever since I’ve been on Zoloft + Wellbutrin I’ve been unable to sleep more than 1-3 hours a night. As of right now I’ve been awake for 3 days straight. I know you’re probably thinking I should switch my meds, but I’ve tried 6 different antidepressants before and these are the only ones that have actually helped with my depression and anxiety. I’ve only started taking this combination about a month ago so it could be that this side effect might go away as my body adjusts to the new antidepressants, especially because I tapered up Zoloft quite fast (from 50mg to 200mg within a month) (as for Wellbutrin I stayed at my starting dose of 150mg), but still each day that goes by I feel like it only gets worse. I always take my meds in the morning and I try to stay away from caffeine but that doesn’t seem to make much difference when it comes to my inability to fall asleep at night. This is also an unusual type of insomnia, as I don’t actually feel tired at all. It’s like I’m in a permanent wave of euphoria and excitement and sleep just feels boring when there are a ton awesome things I could be doing. I obviously know this extreme sleep deprivation isn’t healthy at all though. My psychiatrist prescribed me trazodone 50mg to supposedly help me sleep, but I’ve been very hesitant to try it as I’ve heard it is associated with some nasty hangovers. I took 20mg of diazepam a few hours ago but it’s 1am right now and honestly I don’t feel anything. I’ve been a regular user of benzos for the past few years so my tolerance is quite high. I’m quite concerned honestly, because although one cannot die from insomnia (sooner or later your body gives out) unless they suffer FFI, it is probably different in cases where drugs that actively suppress the brain’s normal mechanisms are involved. I dont really know what to do, I don’t wanna get back to the miserable black hole I was in before finding effective antidepressants, but obviously I’m also not too keen on sleep-depriving myself to death. What should I do? Should I just get the trazodone, has it worked for you? And am I at risk of dying?Thanks in advance.
NotSignal	I want to fix my shit sleep people say to not use ur phone or pc an hour before bed cause of the bluelift but I can I use my light from my light bulbs like have them or is it just as bad
Signal	Hi, I’ve been a chronic insomniac my entire life, trouble getting to sleep, sometimes staying asleep, sleep disturbances such as night terrors and paralysis, under more stressful circumstances auditory hallucinations due to exhaustion. I’ve tried all the classic non medicated approaches to solving this, I’ve paid for a super expensive therapist who specialises in sleep issues. Nothing has changed. I’ve used benzodiazepines fairly heavily in desperate times and while they’re extremely effective they obviously don’t work long term for a few reasons. Anyone know of any drugs that are available in the U.K. that can be taken long term? This is as a last resort of trying everything else. Thanks!
NotSignal	for the past week I've either been sleeping for 4-6 hours or not sleeping at all , why is this?
Signal	It’s now too late for me to take melatonin but too early for me to get ready for work.How do y’all ensure you get enough sleep and wake up to get to work on time??
Signal	I’ve probably not slept for even nearly 5 straight hours in days and I have the overwhelming anxiety that I’m just gonna flat out die. how can I just knock myself out?
NotSignal	Hi, I've been having sleeping problems again for the past couple of weeks now. Last week I tried some sleeping aid which worked but now nothing. I'm currently going through impotence which came about very suddenly and now I'm worried i might have SFI. Which is extremely weird since I usually can have a erection no problem. This is causing me to get anxious of the real possibility of sfi making it hard to relax. Even when i try I either don't feel like it mentally and definitely physically. I'm also having an extremely difficult time concentrating. How prevalent is impotence during insomnia?
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for a week. I think I have trauma from insomnia problems as a child, so I’ve started to dread bed time as a result of being reminded of that time period. I can feel this turning into a vicious cycle. I’m so fucking tired. My doctor prescribed me Trazodone to help me fall asleep.. I took it the other night and I didn’t get any sleep until early morning. I’ve seen things saying to take it an hour before bed, but i’ve also seen posts saying to take it 5 hours before bed... i’m having trouble falling asleep, not just staying asleep. please help.
Signal	My psychiatrist ordered it. I'm on latuda, trintellix, and mirtazapine but the mirtazapine is at too high of a dose for it to work for sleep. She said with everything I'm on I should be sleeping. For a while on this med combo I was but I think anxiety is why I'm not. I'm a teacher and we're going back to work and that scares me. She thinks sleep apnea but I have none of the symptoms. She didn't even ask me about my sleep when she said that.She also ordered an insomnia test, that I have to go in for. I can't sleep without meds so I'll fail that hands down. It's during the day.Mirtazapine at lower doses helps my sleep but I need it for the depression so I need a higher dose. Trazodone left me depressed and didn't fully work. Lunesta made me depressed and suicidal. Atarax used to work but now it's not. Temazepam works but she's against it. Who is ok with lunesta but not temazepam? Whatever.If it's not sleep apnea what can a sleep study tell her? What exactly is an insomnia test? They said something about trying to sleep for half an hour and seeing if you fall asleep. That's not going to happen. People can fall asleep on command? During the day? I'm doing it at 5pm.It's a 3 night at home sleep study. I don't know what to expect. Any insight?
NotSignal	I went to sleep at midnight thinking I would do my normal routine and wake up at 8. This did not happen.I woke up 2am. I laid in my bed trying to fall asleep till around 3 when I gave up on sleeping. Now it's 3am what am I going do? Homework.I'm a college student and this is my final semester so I have a ton of projects. I did 1 of them in around an hour then tried to sleep again.The sleep did not come again so I thought fuck it I'll do one more project. I have now done 3 projects and can't sleep.My plan is to just wait it out I guess.
NotSignal	I haven't suffered insomnia since I got my anxiety medications on board. I ran out of said meds yesterday, forgot to call in for a refill until after the pharmacy closed. It's now the weekend and I won't be able to get a refill until Monday. My bed time is usually 5 hours ago. I sure don't miss this feeling every night. And I don't miss the daytime that will surely come during the day. My heart goes out to the folks who deal with this every day.
NotSignal	Has anyone tried a weighted blanket for insomnia? For some reason I feel like it could help somehow but it's a pretty expensive investment. Willing to try anything at this point tbh though. Has anyone tried!
Signal	This is bugging me so much. I spend several hours just lying in bed trying to sleep. And the longer it goes on, the more I think about how much I’ve lost from this. And days feel so short now, and I can no longer have time for myself because I have little time to do what needs to be done. I hate this.
NotSignal	I’m so worried and anxious about so many things. I feel like my head is filled with so many thoughts. I have a lot of things I have to do that I’ve been putting off. There’s so much stress that I’m feeling right now and it’s messing up my sleep schedule. This really sucks and I feel alone.
Signal	I don’t know why or what it is but for some reason I wake up every single night at 2 or 3am and I cannot fall back to sleep again to save my life. It is SO frustrating I want to cry, and nothing I do seems to work or even help. Every day I am exhausted and think for sure that by the time bedtime rolls around, I’ll be tired enough to make it through the night but like clockwork I am wide awake at the aforementioned times no matter when I fall asleep. Does anyone else have the same (or a similar) issue? I am desperate to find a solution. I am starting to feel like I can’t function. All I want is to be able to rest.
Signal	I’ve been having these lately. Idk what’s wrong with me. I’m so over with worrying I have sfi and not getting sleep because of it. Sfi is been the only thing on my mind since i found out what it was. I have seroquel, and could try that. But if that don’t work, I’m probably fucked and have it. I can’t get more than 2-6 hours of sleep anymore and this anxiety makes it worse. Plzzzzzzz somebody help me.
NotSignal	For the past week now I have been sleeping like absolute shit...seems like everytime I get ready for bed and get all comfy....BOOM...my mind decides it wants to race constantly with so many thoughts.. I wish I had a switch to turn to make it stop..
Signal	I feel like I’m writing this for attention or something but I’m honestly at the end of my fucking rope here.I am so fucking tired of this. After years of anxiety and depression and stupid fucking life choices and scenarios of my own fault I like to feel like things are back on the right track, being back at university.. having a reliable social circle…but not being able to sleep makes everything good in life feel like fucking nothing. It affects my appetite cycle to the point where I feel starving at night and sometimes I need to go on impromptu runs in the middle of the night to try to get out random energy. It makes me irrationally angry to think about my friends who are probably soundly sleeping. When I hear fucking birds chirping and realizing I failed again, or when I end up realizing I’ve taken upwards of 30+ mg of melatonin and feel wide awake.I have severe OCD and Tourette’s like symptoms that manifest as physical tics that make it nearly impossible to sit or lay still. I need to stretch out my hips, my shoulders, all my joints. Need to scratch the space between my toes. It feels like a constant state of being unable to reach or fix an itch, and it makes me feel like I literally want to dig a fucking chunk into my flesh or cut off a certain part so I don’t have to fucking feel it anymore. The symptoms are manageable in the day after years of fucking self training, mostly due to there being enough distractions. But at night I have fucking nothing.I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night without waking up at least once. The medication they tried to put me on sort of worked but made me wake up super early in a state of physical panic. I have pretty much next to no idea how I literally get anything done or have the motivation for anything when I can’t rely on sleep, and I feel like I have literally no options besides medicating to the point of having no feeling or semblance of being myself due to rampant sexual/mood/weight related side effects.I realize that I am pretty much self harming every night because the amount of spasms and forced stretching I do causes aching muscles, and the amount of scratching I do to try to distract my brain from tics is extremely aggressive and terrifying when I look in the mirror and see scars and nail marks on my body.I’m tired of feeling like none of the working out or strength training I do has any effect at all because I can’t sleep long enough or consistently enough to get any benefit at all. I’m tired of feeling like in the day I never have enough energy to do the kinds of workouts I see other people around me doing. It is literally agonizing feeling every night like I can’t rely on getting to sleep when it is such a basic thing.And lastly, I feel beyond angry and depressed that This is another thing added to the list of bullshit in my life that makes me feel like my body and mind are literally trying to kill itself. I know that’s a pathetic and self victimizing thing to say but honestly I just want to FUCKING sleep, that’s all.At the very least with the previous problems of depression and anxiety or the ADD I developed methods to get through the days moment to moment, but I do not know what to do about this. It feels like days are doubly long and I honestly don’t know how much more I can take. Suicidal ideation is back. What’s the fucking point of anything at all when I can’t fucking rely on sleep.I’m scared of pursuing more help because I am terrified immensely of being told it is something chronic that I can’t cure, and scared of what that knowledge would do to me mentally. After what feels like so much bullshit in my life I literally don’t have the energy to put the same kind of day in and day out effort into fixing this as I had to do for years with my OCD, my eating disorder, my fucking sexuality or my depression and anxiety. I feel like a broken useless fucking piece of shit with an endless laundry list of bullshit and I wish a SINGLE. FUCKING. THING about me worked at ALL.
Signal	Sorry its a little long..I maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle, decent diet, exercise, slim no respiratory issues, well i have allergies, but i have been diagnosed with panic disorder and GAD. Therapy was helping me take back my life and I was doing great.then the lockdowns started and for a month my sleep has been fragmented or i just wake too early. I'll wake after 5-6hrs which is a little under what im okay with, been like this for a month. My primary doctor just gave me Hydroxyzine(25mg) which ill start taking today. I am hesitant on medications cause I don't want to be dependent on a med. I am getting sunlight, doing light excercise, hydrating and the like but i keep waking up too early or having fragmented sleep.&#x200B;Just not comfortable with this anymore. It's been affecting my attention, motivation to do things, been feeling a little weak, and my bowel habits have changed. Does this seem like it's an issue of stress or should I blow off stimulus money on seeing a bunch of a doctors? The first 2 weeks of this i was stressing bad but then I had a week of crying spells and the stress is gone but my poor sleep habits have stayed. (Which is why im a little concerned)Ik this level of insomnia isn't near as bad as everyone elses but i really hate it. I am used to getting around 8hrs every night from like 9-10pm to 5-6am. I have started a week back doing CBTi using some worksheets and an app provided by my Therapist. I also want to mentioned we started doing EMDR then this pandemic happened. Could that have affected me? Any advice helps thanks all !
NotSignal	i've always had trouble sleeping, it typically would take me 1-3 hours of laying in my bed in the dark before i could fall asleep, and no matter what time i would wake up i would still feel terrible. however, quarantine has made me fuck over my sleep schedule so hard that now i don't get the lightest feeling of being tired until 4 AM, meaning i typically fall asleep at 6 and wake up at 1-4 PM. this isn't asking for advice or anything, this is just a vent lol
NotSignal	Could my brain just not do this shit? How is someone meant to function when they can't even sleep? I'm really sick of it. These kinda sleeping problems happen frequently. Occasionally I'll try to stay up later so that I can wake up in the very late afternoon to lap around to tire myself out so I can sleep earlier the next night but then I just end up crashing in like 10 hours and falling asleep. Sometimes I succeed at having a normal sleep schedule through these torturous methods but then I'll just relapse in a few days anyway and the cycle begins again. I actually do sleep 6-9 hours quite often but I never feel rested and I always lie in bed for hours before I can sleep.
Signal	I've been insomniac all my life. I can remember being 8 years old and having troubles with my family because of my fucked up sleeping patterns.I'm 28 now. For the last year I worked in a night shift hoping it would help me with my sleeping patterns, since forcing myself to a regular schedule never seemed to work. But I was wrong; I started going to sleep at 1pm when my shift was over at 7am.It's just crazy. I was on meds for two years and it did help me to have a regular sleep pattern, but my personality was affected, and following my therapist advice I decided to drop them.Currently I just moved to a different country and I am not working since I have to wait for different paperworks to be done. And sleeping seems impossible. I feel my throat burning with anxiety and my mind speeding up while the hours pass in bed in the darkness of my bedroom.It's messing up with my relationships with friends and my depression is getting worse because I don't see much sunlight and I don't have much hours of sleep.I feel bad for my wife since she just started working and my sleeping patterns are making housework incredibly difficult for me. It's worse than it had been in years. It doesn't matter how early I wake up, I just can't seem to be able to sleep.
Signal	I can't keep a consistent sleep schedule. I've tried everything (medication, sleep hygiene, therapy) and if after the pandemic its not better I will go to a sleep specialist but my insurance doesn't cover it and its very expensive so any insight or any tips will be very appreciated.I'm at a point where I will manage to wake up and go to bed at the same time for one day and that's it, then it's chaos. I just don't get sleepy when I should the next night (I will get sleepy like 7 hours after what my bedtime should be) and then many times I'm unable to wake up in the morning, it feels like I'm on drugs when the alarm rings. When I manage to get up early I'm very tired all day and then get to bed at a normal time (think 11pm) then wake up at 2 am unable to sleep. I've been sleeping all day long some days and then stay awake all night. I then stay awake all say on zero sleep trying to regain normalcy, I may achieve a normal schedule for a day and the following night I can't sleep again. It's like most of my energy right now is focused on trying to sleep at the same time every day. And I can't. I'm always tired when I manage to go to bed "early" (as in 12pm) and wake up early, but I've never been able to keep it up for like a month and let my body adjust to it. I'm rested but feel emotionally drained when I spend my day sleeping. Has anyone had this problem and been able to fix it? It's like being constantly jet lagged.I want to add that this is nothing new. I have had insomnia since I was born and it has always affected me a lot... but I'm 24 and I need to gain control over it. I've always managed to stay productive, study, work and be social and not a lot of people know about my sleep problems, but they affect my every day to a point only people with chronic insomnia can understand and I'd like to live life without this burden. Any ideas?
NotSignal	Avoiding bright screens like laptops and phones before bed? Check.Cool environment? Check.Exercise and a healthy diet? Check.Aromatherapy? Melatonin? Yoga? Non caffeinated tea? Warm milk? Mirtazapine? Light stretching? Meditation? Motherf***ing checks all over.But nooooo i still lie in bed for hours asking myself what i did wrong. Thanks brain, for only being awake when i DON’T need you to be and spacing out when i DO need you to be.
Signal	the last time i felt tired and sleepy was around 9 days ago,ever since then i have trouble sleeping,like i can literally lay down in bed for 6 hours without any devices,noises or distractions and still not fall asleep,i don´t remember sleeping this week,i remember having a few dreams that i don´t remember having before so that means that i must have slept a few times,but i think most days i just stay in bed all night not even feeling a little bit tired,i do get a bit relaxed but that´s it
NotSignal	Ive noticed that if i skipped sleeping for a day and try to sleep that following night... i kinda shiver like im cold but im really not. Is it anxiety or adrenaline or what?
NotSignal	I've had this problem since 2016. I go to bed, I can fall asleep within 10 minutes, but then I wake up after 5 - 5.5 hours. I don't feel rested when I wake up and during the day, I struggle to function. I know the difference because once every few months, I get 6.5 - 7.5 hours of sleep and I feel like a different person. Anyone else has this problem or was able to treat this condition? I use a CPAP machine and my AHI is fairly low. I'm not diabetic or pre-diabetic. I don't know the f\*\*\*k the problem. Any help/advise would be appreciated.
Signal	I stayed up until little bit after 7am, woke up at 2pm, went back to sleep then woke up at 4pm.At 4Pm I was half asleep, I closed my eyes then my ears started to ring LOUD. I couldn't move and I wasn't that scared cause this happens every once in awhile. But sometimes I'm scared because I can't move or breath.Can someone tell me a similar experience?Idk
Signal	So I’ve been experiencing early awakenings a lot more than usual lately... usually I wake up around 6-6:30, but this last week I’ve been waking up between 4-5 and sometimes I can eventually fall back asleep for an extra hour, other times I can’t back to sleep... so I’ve been up since 4:30am and I’m tired, even with getting 4-5 hours of (broken) sleep. 😞 I don’t know why I’m waking up so early now... what causes early morning awakenings?
NotSignal	It suddenly happened one night and it's been a week now. I thought it was one of those waking up "as if your falling" sensation but it has turned for the worse.Everytime I lie down I get these internal tremors?? Sometimes my legs twitch but most of the time it's shaking "inside". I think I got the RLS last year (no real diagnosis) and it just went away on its own but this sensations are different than that.Sometimes the "shakiness" starts from my legs but most of the time it starts from my torso then spreads to my legs. I usually move around to stop it and I wait until it's like 5-7am when my eyes get droopy to sleep.Thats usually how I've been sleeping lately waiting for myself to be tired in the afternoon and sleep for 4-5 hrs. But at night, I usually stay late, which is my normal routine 12 am and I usually sleep at 1-2am which is normal (and unhealthy) and I wake up at 8-9 am and sleep at noon. But know I can't sleep for more than 1 hour in the night.I would watch asmr to try to help me sleep, but I wake up and I only slept 1 hr and the shakiness slowly comes back and I can't sleep again.Sorry for the long post but it's been bothering. I'm still quite young. I have no general diagnosis, not taking any pills. No history of epilepsy. I'm not sure if I have anxiety and I'm scared to go to the hospital in the situation right now. The tremors themselves aren't painful just annoying. Please help in any way.
Signal	So, I've tried everything in the book. I've done OTC meds, prescription meds, sleep hygiene. I've tried resetting my internal clock. I've tried apps, meditation, sleep machines, different types of blankets etc etc etc. Literally everything anyone has offered me for sleep, I have tried it. Right now I take about 1000mg of GABA (not gabapentin) and about 100mg of hydroxyzine just to actually close my eyes. But then I'm awake about 3 hrs later and it just repeats itself. I've tried non legal things. Been to therapy about it. I don't even know why I have this issue. The only thing I can link it back to (and believe me, I've tried) is an article I read when I was 7? It was in a magazine my grandma had about how we spend about 1/3 of our life sleeping. It horrified me. That you spend so much time sleeping and then you die. But my sleep issues preceded that. I didn't sleep as a baby either but I didn't cry. I would just lay there. That's what my mom and grandma said. I wouldn't cry when I woke up either. I would just wait. I'm starting to think there's no remedy for me. That I'm going to be stuck like this forever. I turn 30 in a few months and I still haven't solved it. What is a person supposed to do?
NotSignal	so it's been 5 days since i got an insomnia. now the cause of my insomnia is gone, but now i got some neck tremors. idk why but since i got insomnia the neck tremors won't stop and now the tremors is the one that making me anxious. is anybody there same as me?
Signal	Morning all, tried all sorts after suffering with sleep problems on and off for many years. Its got massively worse this year - I have been prescribed 10mg of zopidem (ambien) and after 4 days taking i feel normal again. Good quality restful sleep and no grogginess like zoplicone. Obviously I want to continue feeling like this but there are lots of warnings out there. Anyone used this long term without issues or is that a big no no? I’d been getting 2-3 hours poor quality sleep for weeks prior to this. And some nights less.
NotSignal	Debating on if I should try to sleep. I have work at 2 pm it’s about to be 5. I just finished a blunt. I’ve been having so much on my mind that seems to be stuck. I’m laying next to my ex, her son is here with us. (not mine) (at least I don’t think so DNA test coming soon) I’ve been making poor choices and it’s making my insomnia even worse. Yesterday was the first day in 3 days, I slept 8 or 9 hours it felt good but sleep apnea also keeps me fatigued. I’m probably sharing a lot, but honestly I think I’m gonna wait for the baby to wake up and feed him and change him. Maybe get him to sleep some more. In the mean time call of duty.
Signal	A doc prescribed cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxant) for insomnia once. I would like to know if are there more muscle relaxants meds used for sleep...
NotSignal	We’re out of town for my daughter’s karate competition. There’s an oscillating noise that sounds like a washing machine, except it’s been going on for over 3 hours and doesn’t seem to be stopping. It’s loudest near my bed. I tried sleeping on the floor in another room (we have two connecting rooms), but I still hear AND the floor is uncomfortable. This sucks sooooo bad.
Signal	I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but I couldn’t find anywhere a place that was right. At least you guys will know what I’m talking about.I’ve been on seroquel for 4 years (not for insomnia, for mood stabilising) and I am weaning off it now.How the hell am I supposed to fall asleep naturally? I have had maybe 2 naps in all 4 years and I don’t know how to fall asleep.Before seroquel I always had difficulty getting to sleep and now I’m finally working again and I don’t know how this is gonna work. I was also a heavy drug user/drinker and now I’m clean so how do I learn to fall asleep naturally for the first time since I was a kid?
Signal	The last four days I have gotten around 6-9 hours of sleep total and I am so exhausted and tired. I am laying here at 6am and I cannot go to sleep I just want peace and rest I hate this so much why am I like this
Signal	Like everyone else in hear I struggle to sleep. Getting 4 hours is a miracle if it happens.. So for the past year I've fallen in love with intermittent Fasting and some types of sleep medications (prescribed or over the counter) can break a fast which is a major no no. However, I hear that magnesium does not and that it's great for mental relaxation which is mainly why I can't sleep, because of my brain. Does anyone have any info or advice when it comes to magnesium and it's effects? And if so what is a good clean brand? Thanks!
NotSignal	Hi, thanks for clicking my post. I had a massive 4 hour panic attack on Monday night complete with 4 hours of shaking and terror, and ever since then I have had these constant adrenaline surges when trying to sleep. Right before I am about to let go and drift off, I feel a shock from my system that starts in my chest. I don't think it's a hypnic jerk because my limbs don't usually move. They happen every few seconds when I am laying down and trying to focus on relaxing my breath, or even if I start to drift off while meditating. It's like my body is really fighting sleep because the adrenaline makes me feel instantly alert, my system feels hyperaroused after each surge. Haven't been able to sleep until 1:30 AM. My dog wakes me up for a walk at 5:30AM. I don't even know how proceed. I see my psyc dr on Tuesday so who knows what he will prescribe. At such a loss, I had been getting great sleep for a couple years. Any idea for treatment, things I should ask my dr about?
NotSignal	Looking like one of those nights. Happy I don’t need to work tomorrow at least. Shit still sucks regardless
Signal	I have been taking 25 mg of Seroquel for the past 2 weeks and it has been great untill one night of really bad anxiety and I didn't sleep. I've since had to take 50 mg to fall asleep and I am so worried about uping my dose and it not working or becoming totally dependent. I haven't had insomnia like this ever and am desperate to sleep at night but at what cost? Has anyone had this experience? Will I just have to keep uping my dose or will I level out and be able to sleep normal again?
Signal	Does anyone see things when y’all are tired like something creepy I’m currently 18 hours no sleep I’m on a 24 hour shift but I get 1hr breaks but I still can’t sleep so on my way back to work I was driving and I saw this very creepy figure and I kinda swerved and it vanished does this have anything to do with sleep insomnia i talked to my wife and she said she used to get it back in her hometown like something was hovering over her.
NotSignal	I went from not sleeping 3-4 nights a week to falling right asleep reliably the past week. I don't even have to do sleep meditations anymore. The only drawback is that I do feel a bit groggy the next day, but it's a small price to pay for a good night's sleep.
NotSignal	How long can it take? Sometimes i wake up after 3 hours only, then sometimes i get 5 hours or 6,with disrupts, but it seems like it's not going back to normal, _, went to sleep 10pm woke up at 1 tossing ans turning ans now its 6 am
NotSignal	Just think its funny that these 95 people are probably also stuck awake. However despite it being only 1 am just about i'm very tired and might sleep well tonight :) lets hope!
Signal	Hey everyone,I've been suffering from insomnia for about 5 years now. I decided to start sleeping at the same time and waking up at the same time everyday. I spend about 8 hours in bed.The first week went okay, but the second week my body seemed to adjust to sleeping even less and my overall sleep got worse? Instead of getting 5.5 to 6 hours I was getting 5 or less or average.I'm scared that restricting those 8 hours of bed time to about 6 might make my sleep even worse. I tend to fall asleep fine, but always wake up after 2-4 hours and struggle to fall back asleep. I usually fall asleep eventually but don't sleep more than 2-2.5 hours after that.Anyone face something similar when attempting to correct their circadian rhythm?
Signal	My insomnia started September last year, because of sleep-related anxiety after a really bad vacation where I couldn’t sleep at all. A few months later, it mostly went away and I thought I had it under control till last month. One bad night set me off and now my sleep-related anxiety is driving me CRAZY. I stay up for hours and hours because I’m stressing over sleep and I have no idea what to do about it. Since last month, I’ve been getting only 2-3 hours of sleep most nights and I can’t get rid of the anxiety at all. Please give me tips on how to deal with mthe anxiety, it’s driving me crazy. And tips on how to sleep better because I can’t survive off of a few hours per day any longer.
NotSignal	Hey all, I’m looking for your experiences on how you cope with insomnia whilst managing to successfully work? Thanks in advance
Signal	I’m 16 have MDD and insomnia. I can’t take it anymore I go days with only 6 hours of sleep, crash and sleep 12 hours a day my body be like a dying battery. My doctor gave me trazodone but mom said essential oils all need. I tried it and am so mad my mom is poison to me her stupid anti vax and something else like internet causes cancer. I’m desperate my body is bad and so is my mind I have no trust I may die soon from something crazy ahhh. So sorry for ranting Louie this
Signal	I think I have fatal insomnia or at-least im horrified of it. I know its extremely rareThat does not stop my hypochondria. Please give me facts
Signal	So, my sleep pattern is horrible and I need to reset it.Funnily it's always good during holidays and then gets fucked up when school begins bc I need to stay up to study or just don't get my necessary relaxation and need to stay awake longer. Since the last holidays it has gone from 11pm-12am to 2-3am when school began and is now a very unstable 5-8am. Most of the time I'll get the needed amount of sleep, this means I'm not tired enough to fall asleep earlier. Setting alarms doesn't help much either bc I won't wake up 60% of the time bc I'm just not used to this sleep pattern and even if I'll stay up late anyway. Exercise (during the day) doesn't help either. I've been out multiple days doing extremely straining labor and I still stayed up 5 more hours after getting home. Most of the time I eat hours before trying to sleep (not hungry tho).I've tried resetting it by pulling an all-dayer (lol) and sleeping early two or three times but it still doesn't work. First time I managed to wake up early the next day and thought it was finally resolved but even though I tried making everything perfect (lowering the light gradually, making sure all other lights are out, calming down before sleep, staying still for at least 30min) I still couldn't sleep and stayed awake until 6am. Last time I tried (two days ago) I even had trouble falling asleep after being awake for 24+ hours. The next day I slept 14h. Yesterday I tried making everything perfect again but still wasn't sleeping after 2 1/2 hours so I decided to just fuck bc why would I waste my time trying to sleep when I could just be productive. Fell asleep at 5am. I've always had issues falling asleep but most of the time I still stay in a certain window and manage to keep it that way. Now my body seems to fall back into this ~5am sleep pattern over and over and I don't know what to do. It's 1am for me now and although I feel tired I bet I won't be able to sleep soon. I have holidays now so so I have a week to fix this crap. I really, really want to be awake when the sun rises. I want to wake up to the sun shining though my windows and coloring my whole room golden. If you have any tips please give them to me.
Signal	I am 18 (M) I would say I have a very bad anxiety disorder where I have mess delusions and over think situations this has never being checked and happening for as long as I can remember.3 years ago i had problems sleeping and I had massive panic attacks about it because inremeber my on friend saying you hallucinate from not sleeping for more than 2 nights. So because of my overthkining delusions I freaked out about sleep for two months then I realised I can sleep perfectly....fast forward to today this problem has come back and it seems worse than ever not sleeping at night, sleeping in the day which has messed up my sleep pattern now my anxiety is through the roof i did not sleep last night so I tried to Sleep now at 18:00 I slept but then I got woken up at 8 now I can't fall back asleep.I have anxiety about being an insomniac but can someone tell me what an insomniac really is almost because I am uncertain which causes my anxiety.
Signal	I worked ten hours today I was so tired still am and can’t sleep. I’ve also been clenching my jaw from all the stress I’ve been under so it hurts to eat / talk / laugh / smile. I’m just having a horrible life these days. I can sleep anywhere else perfectly fine but my new home nope maybe an hour a night. I was prescribed ambient but haven’t taken it as I’m afraid I’ll become dependent.
NotSignal	I quit marijuana and alcohol cold turkey last week and Insomia has now entered my life. I know my brain will heal over time and things will get better!However, I’ve been struggling with waking up after I fall asleep (maybe I get 2-3 hours at most) then I end up waking up horny as fuk. The last few nights has consisted of me just tossing and turning for a few hours hard as fuck. I’m happy my sex drive is coming back (I was smoking a half Ounce a week). However, it seems my body is now using sexual thoughts/fantasizing to get a dopamine high. I don’t masturbate (Ive discovered I experience many benefits from semen retention and currently I’m trying to find a girlfriend....so masturbating before bed is not an option.)Does anyone have any advice how to beat this? I’ve read cold showers can help get rid of extreme horniness.
Signal	What the fuck is wrong my stupid brain. Anytime I try to sleep, my body starts fucking itching, and I feel like shit.
NotSignal	I haven't gotten good rest until last night. Before that my rib cage was in pain. I'm afraid I caught covid even though I know I have been extremely cleanly this whole time. Can someone tell me if this is a normal thing or not?
Signal	Btw, I'm 16 years old.I used to have ok sleep. 4-6 hours daily. If I was lucky even 7 .Then quarantine came... I started going to bed late and messed up my sleeping schedule.At the start it was 3 am when I would turn off my phone and then fell asleep around 3:30. Then it was 4, then 5.Then I started to feel like I couldn't concentrate. I felt like I couldn't see well. I also couldn't play videogames as well as I used to.I started getting worried so I stopped going to bed late. But, it just made it worse for my mental health because I tried to sleep so hard I would stay up even later than I did if I was using my phone. (Up to like 8 am, when everyone woke up, I was just starting to fall asleep. It was mentally taxing having to just sit there, on my bed for HOURS trying to sleep and not getting tired at all.)What can I do? I can't concentrate for online school work. I can't have fun in videogames because I can't play good anymore. It's been like 3 weeks since I first had serious sleeping problems and it's actually getting really annoying(Also how do I stop thinking??? I can't stop. my head is just full of thoughts. It's mostly why I stay up. My eyes are tired, my body doesn't work properly, but my mind just doesn't shut down for sleep)
Signal	So many of the meds I’ve tried for this made me gain weight, I stopped taking everything except gabapentin cause of it but desperately need something stronger. What’s worked for you guys WITHOUT putting on pounds? I have a psych appt this week and want to go in with some suggestions so he doesn’t just recommend “therapy” again
NotSignal	We’ve all probably seen how insomnia is portrayed in the cartoons and the movies, but let’s be real... it’s not like that(for me at least). Those cartoons and movies make it seem like insomnia brings paranoia, but usually that isn’t the case. I personally struggle with insomnia and yes there are nights when I get paranoid but that is only if it’s been at least four days since I’ve slept, not the 1st-3rd nights. Most of the time it ends up being a night that starts out with you trying to sleep for a few hours until you realize it’s one of those days and then you watch YouTube or scroll through reddit until you should be awake. Summary: insomnia isn’t as bad as it seems, more of just an annoyance. Thank you for coming to my ted type.
NotSignal	I just wanted to say thank you to everyone in this community. I lost my job earlier this year and my sleep started getting worse and the only thing that helped was knowing that there were other people out there with the same struggles.A very kind user here pushed me towards a CBTI app and for the first time in months, I'm starting to feel optimistic about things. CBTI may not work for everyone but I know there is a solution out there that will work for you.I know the times are tough, but each and every one of you have got this <3
Signal	I have the most wonderful husband, but sometimes I want to strangle him in his sleep. (Only joking, I adore him.) I don’t know if I have full fledged insomnia, but my body has always been afraid to fall asleep. It stems from my childhood abuse, but even after years of counseling, that never went away. It takes me hours to fall asleep, even when I’m exhausted, and I wake up at the smallest sounds or movement. I used to fall asleep in class a lot, because some nights I just didn’t sleep. Now as an adult, I’m lying here in bed, having only slept 20 minutes and I’m annoyed at my husband for accidentally waking me up. To top off my already crappy ability to sleep, the love of my life has restless leg syndrome AND he snores. We finally bought a Tuft and Needle king size mattress/bed for motion transfer, and it has been an absolute godsend. I wear earplugs every night, and he takes magnesium to help. He’s so sweet about it and he’s always willing to go sleep on the couch, but I hate to make him move. I’ve tried sleeping there, but I just can’t. We both work night shifts right now too, which worsens a lot of the issues. I have to be places now when I’m supposed to be sleeping. I get so jealous that he can fall asleep 5 minutes after lying down. Now I have to go to a bridal shower on 20 minutes of sleep and drive an hour each way. I’m mostly just venting to people who understand, and I know a lot of you have it worse than me. PS: does anyone cry when they don’t get sleep? It almost never fails that I will try super hard not to cry, but I will weep about the dumbest thing when I haven’t slept. It’s horribly embarrassing (especially for a shy introvert like me).TLDR: I’ll probably cry at my friend’s bridal shower today, but not appropriately, for something stupid, like the pretty color of the cake
NotSignal	I have been experiencing sleep issues since my county went on lockdown for the pandemic. I havent had a good night's rest since. Last night I actually stayed up until 4am, as for the other nights i sleep at 9 or 10pm and wake at 2-3am. so im bankin around 5hrs of sleep per night. It's hard for me to sleep again after a early wake up until 6am when i eat something.I dont feel stressed about the virus. Is it a subconscious issue? Maybe just cause my sleep routine was thrown off? Im not sure but ive been very lethargic. Im a typical 9 or 10pm to 5 to 6am sleeper. this virus threw everything off and i cant cope with it very well.&#x200B;Just want to note I am going through therapy for anxiety issues. i wasdoing good managing them until one night i had bad sleep. since then its been bad sleep every night. Im seeing a doctor on monday, til then anyone have any advice?
Signal	I’ve been trying to sleep since 10pm, it is now almost 3am my time. I have a lot planned for tomorrow and am getting more stressed than relaxed as the minutes tick by... I already took my sleep meds hours ago and they just didn’t work, now it may be to late to take more. I am so awake right now, more awake than I have been all day and feeling very productive like I want to organize all the closets, but I really can’t crash tomorrow as there are a lot of plans and I have to be functional. When this kind of thing happens to you guys do you push through and just stay up? Or try to keep doing the sleep/relaxation tools and try to get some sleep? I am starting to get a little afraid to sleep as I don’t want to oversleep and have slept through alarms after being up all night. Well thanks for reading and any experiences or insight you want to share would be appreciated!
Signal	Started Mirtazapine for depression and to help with sleep. Had high hopes. First night I was knocked out and had a massive sleep. After 3 days they stopped working and 6 weeks later my sleep is alot worse, cant fall alseep or stay asleep, I have 1-3 hrs sleep and Im awake for no less than 20hrs. This has been this bad for a few weeks, Im so fustrated, I just want to sleep and not be tired, Im starting to feel insane due to sleep deprivation. I see things in my head but in real life, like Im dreaming outside my sleep.
NotSignal	My boyfriend suffers from sleep issues, and I am looking for advice on how to help. What should I understand about insomnia? How can I become more informed? What can I do to be more understanding and helpful? How should I go about gently selling my SO on the idea of seeking help?This isn't something I can fix. It's his journey, and I'm aware of that. But if any of you had any firsthand experience or tips that could help me be a better partner in this, I'd greatly appreciate it!Thanks!
NotSignal	I can’t fall asleep any time before 3 am without meds (antidepressants + sleeping pills). I’ve been late for school every single day since it started. I can’t even hear a hint of my loud alarm until my mom comes in my room to wake me up. And then after 5 seconds of consciousness, I fall back asleep and when I wake up again, I’m already an hour late.
NotSignal	My insomnia has gotten really bad again in the past 3 weeks. So usually my insomnia is waking up at different points of my sleep and not being able to fall back asleep for at least another hour or more. For example, I will wake up in the middle of the night or early morning and not be able to fall asleep again and feel restless. I will wake up around 4 or 5 am and not fall back asleep until after 6 am. It will sometimes change to not being able to fall asleep. Sometimes I will toss and turn and keep changing positions unable to get comfortable. Last night, I laid in bed around 3 am and was unable to fall asleep until 6:30 am. Luckily, with the pandemic my work hours are limited and I was able to sleep in which I basically on and off slept for 6-7 hours or so. I've had no energy today and have been feeling quite depressed and am feeling stressed out knowing when I go to bed I will most likely either be unable to fall asleep or keep waking up. I was diagnosed with a very very mild sleep apnea which I couldn't tolerate the CPAP machine for and have been working out and eating healthier and have lost some weight to help. I will sometimes diffuse essential oils at night, do a meditation before bed, journal, or try sleep music. I will also read at night when I'm unable to sleep. I have a weighted blanket but kick it off in my sleep. I've also been told I grind my teeth at night and will make noises and sleep talk. When I am able to sleep for a few hours at a time or am so tired I will fall into REM sleep more quickly, I get vivid nightmares. Does anyone have any advice on anything else that may help? It's getting to the point at night where I'm stressed to even sleep because of how my sleep has been each night.
NotSignal	Does anyone else find it kind of twisted that insomnia/sleep could even be a problem or a struggle for some people? Like... as HUMANS. When babies are born, they breathe, cry, eat, and SLEEP automatically. Why does sleep have to be the one that gets fucked up for some people later in life? No one “forgets” how to breathe or how to cry... granted— eating can get disordered throughout development, okay...but I’m just saying sleep is one of those basic functional. How did my brain just STOP knowing how to do it??? It’s unfair. Just speaking out of frustration. I’m TIRED. :(
Signal	43f - Ambien plus Klonopin get me there but insurance limits what they pay for so I’m left with about a week a month without anything prescription. Also if I need to take the klonopin for anxiety during the day that means there’s no klonopin to help the ambien work. (Side note on ambien I’ve heard how well it works on people right away, for me at both 5 and 10 mg doses it can take two hours or more for me to fall asleep on it that’s why I couple with klonopin.)So over the counter - this past month I’ve been hitting the Tylenol PMs, or the night time cough syrup or the Vick’s vapocool (minty!) but I think all that acetaminophen might be causing a rectal bleeding issue.Last month I stopped the Benadryl because the diphenhydramine in it (which is also in the nighttime sickie meds) gives me restless legs if I have too much of it.The melatonin and other sleep vitamins I take help minimally so I guess I can add them to whatever I take.Without taking any sleep aids or medications I will stay up for two days no sleep. Any OTC recommendations/advice would be great, also open to other Rxs I should talk to my Dr about.Many thanks
NotSignal	I want to try melatonin pills, but I don't know if they work or if they generate resistance
NotSignal	I have been up since 1:30 am this morning. Throughout the night I’ve tried to fall asleep but hypnic jerk keeps getting in the way. I tried switching sides of my bed, switching pillow etc. Nothing has been working and it’s freaking 8:40 in the morning! I don’t know what else to do.
Signal	I can never sleep I’ll sleep an hour one night and the next day I’m fine then the next day can’t sleep and this continues. I’ve taken three sleeping pills I’m tired as shit still up. I work eight hours tomorrow and have a huge exam Monday so I can’t sleep or rest tomorrow I have to study. Knowing this freaks me out even more. Can’t call out because need money. Pretty sure all of this is bc of my shitty ass living situation living with my ex but it’s fine. Life’s great. Also can’t find a therapist anywhere near me with my insurance so this will probably go on until I move. Yay me.
NotSignal	So my issue always has been with falling asleep.These last weeks I started managing this with less screen, reading before bed, less coffee, and herbal solutions to help me sleep.My issue is that now when I manage to fall asleep at a reasonable time that would allow me to sleep 8h (12pm in my case), I wake up 6/6:30 after that. I know for me it is far from enough, I need my 8 hours.The paradox is that when I sleep later (around 2am), I often get 8 hours, in the weekends e.g.Did some of you manage to solve this? Does it just extend back to 8 hours with discipline and going to bed at the same time every night?
NotSignal	First and foremost I have to say to whomever here has or is battling insomnia you are real warriors man! Like I had to go on 3-5 hours of sleep and sometimes even less cause of a major hives reaction a while back, and the meds i was forced to take caused sevre insomnia for 1.5 months. It was a disaster being on the meds and I felt depressed everyday. And, my emotions were crazy all because I couldn't sleep. But, now I got another problem which if I can get some help would be slick lol. So, in reality since high school's end i have avoided getting up early due to my bad sleep schedule usually can't sleep till 2 or 3 o clock but waking up at 10 or 11 has always saved me. But, now I can't run away from it anymore as finally I will be getting a job and its safe to say I'm not ready for the waking up part at all as I have to be up by 7:30. And, for past 3 years at 7 I'm like 4 hours into my sleep usually lol. I have to start working in a few weeks and I don't know how I can possibly sleep by 11. Like past three years I usually had the most energy around 8ish to late 11 oclocks lol. My fav moments came during this time as I played sports or video games with friends at my home or online always during this time. It just feels empty sleeping early. Like yesterday I tried at 11 leaving my family to chill by themselves and tell my friends I'm sleepy. And, for first 30 minutes I felt empty like sad to be missing out on the fun(we usually play sports till 11:30). Anyways around 1;00 I was still awake day dreaming. Around 1:30 when I usually feel sleepy I finally started falling asleep. Worst part is on nights I know I have to be up early I can't sleep till 3 or 4 like I took one 8am class thank god it was only once a week cause that night I couldn't sleep till 3am when i went to bed at 12 and when I somehow do fall asleep at 1ish I keep getting up.SO any help on how to get my sleep schedule to at least 12ish
Signal	Anyone else who has been dealing w insomnia for few months eyes sore throughout the day like stingy as if ur really tired yet you can’t fall asleep even if you try? This has been the case for ages & happens at night when I feel really tired and yet STILL can’t fall asleep. Wake up eyes burning all over again?
Signal	I'm tired of this. my first post on reddit was a post asking of ways to help deal with lack of sleep 2 years ago, and yet I'm having it the worst ever. Constant methods(CBT, blue tinted computer, meditation, and much more. The constant brain fog, sunken eyes, lack of motivation to do anything, and moodiness have destroyed me. My GPA is now the lowest its been ever since elementary school. I used to be considered the smartest in my whole class, and yet now I can't understand basic geometry. Its taken such a vicious hold on my life. I have asked the doctor for something 2 years in a row, and without fail she gives me the go to bed earlier, take melatonin, dont use the bed for anything other than sleep. My parents just say "go to sleep it's not hard". I dont know why something that's supposed to be as easy as breathing and drinking water comes so hard to me. Currently reading the sleep book by guy meadows, and if doesn't work, idk man. I just know I can't do even 2 mores of this. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy- so why me?
Signal	I have been trying to figure out why I get so tired during the day. When the sun is out, a lot of the tine i get so tired my eyes get very heavy, and it's hard for me to fall asleep. It pretty much only happens in the day. I have rules out narcolepsy, pots disease, and I am pretty sure it's not anemia. I am worried and tryin to solve my problem. Anyone have any ideas?
NotSignal	Slept at 12pm and woke up at 3pm, i feel like absolute shit. My heads throbbing and my family was mad at me for sleeping until after noon (jokes on them i slept at noon) this is hell—physical disorders get diagnosed but the fact that no matter how severe the mental disorder is—they are ignored. I still cant believe people sleep, wake up and feel refreshed unlike me who feels shittier every time i wake up.
Signal	At the beginning of this year I believed that I had lost the ability to sleep all together. I had been on Trazodone for the last 5 years but out of no where it stopped working and my body seemed to reject sleep all together. As others may have experienced it was literally 0 sleep. No dozing off, no naps, literal no sleep. Doc put me on Mertazapine and a few other things, no effect. The only sleep I got was when I was given Benzo on one of my trips to the emergency room and then later again from a relative, when those ran out any sleep ran out. I felt my body and mind breaking down, I was convulsing uncontrollably. I had trouble figuring out what I was doing or where I was because I had gone days and days without sleep. Another trip to the emergency room begging for some kind of help only to be turned away with "sorry." I became desperate and was now suffering panic attacks because I believed I was going to die. My family, not knowing what to do took me to a Neuro psychiatric hospital that weekend which meant no Doctors would be available till that Monday. I spent a couple of nights in there overcome by anxiety. I was convinced I was going to die. I couldn't move due to the panic and would just lay there hurting convinced I had no future and crying that I would not get to be in my new born son's life. That Monday I met with a Doc and was given Seroquel. I slept. I spent a week in the hospital recovering and was released.Now I take 100mg every night and I sleep great without waking up drowsy. For the most I feel optimistic about my future but in the back of my mind I am very traumatized by my experience. I see a psychiatrist every few months to talk about how I'm doing but for the most life is back to normal and I am grateful. The only real side effects I have noticed is an increased desire for sweets. I have spoken to people who have been on Seroquel for years and are still doing fine which gives me hope.For anyone in this sub on your last legs and laying awake crying at night, I feel your pain and your fear. Not everything works the same way for everyone so I hope you find your relief.
NotSignal	I feel like the guy in The Machinist. I'm writing this on 1 hour of sleep last night. The night before I got 3 hours. And the night before also about 3 hours. This has been going on for the past 1.5 months. My sleep ranges from 1 to 6 hours if I take some antihistamines. This does not have anything to do with the coronavirus, but it is so unfortunate that it is happening parallel to it because everybody is too busy with the coronavirus to help me fix my insomnia.I don't have depression nor anxiety. I have nonetheless tried Headspace meditations and they haven't really helped much so far. I'll keep trying.I regularly lift weights (well until the gyms closed) and jog so I'm physically fit. I have no allergies or anything. I should say I'm also a 23 year old Bulgarian male living in Germany.I don't know if it is mere coincidence or if it was caused by it, but this sleep problem happened after I went out partying 2 nights in a row, getting about 6 hours of sleep each (I had been sleeping perfectly fine until then) and then got sick a couple days later with what I thought was a cold. I slept a lot during the week I was sick and healed pretty easily. That's when the insomnia kicked in. I just couldn't sleep after that. No rhyme or reason to it.My family doctor thinks I have infectious mononucleosis. This is because about 3 weeks after I healed from my initial "cold" I got sick again for about 2.5 weeks with another "flu" or "cold" or whatever. I personally think the reason I got sick again and it took so long for my body to heal the second time is because I was barely sleeping and not because I have mono. Mono doesn't cause insomnia, according to what you read on the internet. In any case, I have had no symptoms of a cold or anything since about 3 days. But my insomnia has not gotten better.Like I said, I'm not anxious and I'm not depressed. I've tried meditation, exercise, I eat healthy food, I dim the lights 2 hours before bedtime and I don't use electronics before bedtime. The actual problem is not falling asleep -- I always fall asleep in little over an hour. The problem is that I keep waking up after a few hours of sleep with a parched throat, or needing to go to the bathroom (even when I end up barely peeing) and I can't fall back asleep no matter what.Please help me! How can I fix this? What kind of disease causes this?P.S: I have never smoked, never drank coffee, never taken drugs, never drank alcohol and have no medical conditions.
NotSignal	20yo Male,For a while now my sleep has been getting worse, and a few days ago it has got to a point where I was only able to sleep for a few hours in 1 hour increments. Well, I've been awake since then (about to be awake for 28h), and although I feel dead I'm unable to sleep. Every time I close my eyes my heart starts racing and eventually either I have to adjust my position because I see it's going nowhere and I won't fall asleep or I get a hypnic jerk that wakes me right up.Which brings me to the point that it all leads to SFI - progressive insomnia with only being able to sleep in 1h increments, every time with vivid dreams (if I wake up 8 times, I remember 8 distinct dreams), hypnic jerks (like 5 an hour today if I try falling asleep) etc. It also got worse after benadryl a few days ago, which further suggests SFI - gets even worse on sleeping aids.I'm honestly scared I'll never be able to fall asleep ever again and that torture of no sleep and progressive dementia awaits me. Normally after 28h awake, I'd fall asleep almost instantly, now it's literally impossible (been trying for hours).
NotSignal	Has anyone else started looking like sh!t ever since your insomnia began? like tired eyes, bad skin, etc.
NotSignal	I went on to YouTube and I typed in sleep music with dark screen and I found some thunder and lightning storm kind of sounds with a dark screen it was 10 hours long when I finally was able to unplug electronically and force myself to lay there I can't even remember I must have fallen asleep within 15 minutes. I'm going to try again in a little while but heading back to bed
NotSignal	This is mostly a vent, but basically I have university access exams (I don't know how you call them in usa or wherever ?) when I have to take a test of each subject I've taken this years (6 in my case) and we do 6 exams in 3 days. I'm trying my best to concentrate and study, but I can't sleep more than 3-4 hours a night to save my life; some nights I don't even sleep. Then when I wake up I can't concentrate and can't barely read a whole paragraph without zoning out because of how tired I am.I'm already behind my studying schedule, and seeing everyone in my high school already knowing a lot of lessons and preparing for the exams since about 2 weeks ago is giving me anxiety, because I'm TOO behind. I don't want to fail my exams, I don't know what I'd do if that even happened, but I can't sleep no matter what I do or which medicines I try.Anyone else feeling like this and having exams/presentations/whatever soon? Any advice?
NotSignal	Hello, i feel like i finally am smashing my anxiety into pieces, but i find myself waking up alot of times in the night, sometimes i would need a tea to fall back asleep. I've read that its quite normal to wake up multiple times at night, just that we won't remember usually, i guess im ok then if i keep going like this yea?
NotSignal	Like that they have a disease or disorder causing it? And I don’t mean apnea or restless leg syndrome. I mean a disease that isn’t sleep related, but has insomnia as a side effect. Or even just a physiological reason.
NotSignal	It’s bizarre. This has been going on for about a year. I haven’t really thought about seeing a doctor because it doesn’t bother me unless I get <3 hours. I have plenty of time to get things done and enjoy some extra free time.What’s going on? Every now and then I crash and sleep for 16 hours, and then it’s back to my usual 3-5.Otherwise I’m pretty fit and healthy.If my “insomnia” isn’t causing immediate issues, should I still seek treatment?
NotSignal	i don’t know if this belongs in this sub if not please tell me which one i should post it in. here i go.i’m on medicine for migraines and my mood they make me fall asleep as soon as they kick in. i normally take them at 12:30am to be asleep by about 1:30am?? and then i wake up about 10am.but last night i decided to go to sleep early i took my medicine at 11:00pm and fell asleep at 12:30am and i woke up at 2:50am. this always happens, if i try and sleep early i wake up 2hrs later. it sucks.what should i do? does this happen to anyone else?
Signal	It’s 2:00 AM. I’ve been lying in my bed since 10:30 PM. I didn’t slept a wink, I’m freakin tired and I want some sleep. So i’m thinking of either -> take a Sleep Aid right now and set myself an alarm for like 10:00 AM or -> Trying to get some sleep without any meds (I ran out of melatonin last night) It will most likely finish with me pulling an all nighter which brings me to option 2/3 -> waiting for 7:00 AM and try to get some sleep during the day.
NotSignal	I'm a lifelong insomniac/shitty sleeper who is currently 33 weeks pregnant with my second kid. The third trimester insomnia is truly an awful, awful thing. "Sleep while you can!" they howl at me, as if it's that fucking easy.Monday night I didn't sleep at all. Or at least, I think I didn't? The next night was decent, but last night was awful. I got in bed at 9:30, read for an hour until I was drifting off, then laid down. Eventually I felt very alert, and like I hadn't slept at all since laying down, and I looked at the clock and it was 1:30am. At that point I got up to read a magazine to try to get sleepy again, got back in bed at 4, fell asleep (again, not deeply) and woke up at 5:30am and then 6:30am.It felt like those three hours between 10:30pm and 1:30am of "not sleeping" flew by. A coworker suggested that I might have been lightly dozing, which is why it felt like I was awake but the time went by so quickly. Is it possible that I AM sleeping (albeit poorly and lightly) and just think that I'm awake the whole time? Thanks in advance.
Signal	My psych doc says it’s not possible for me to experience discontinuation symptoms on the dose of Trazadone I take (150mg before bed), but if I skip it for two nights, the next day I get constant weird electric chills (not temperature chills, more like zaps), and as the day goes on my tongue starts to feel fat and I start to itch all over, like I’m having a histamine reaction. I’ve experienced this enough times now that I know it’s related to not taking the Trazadone for two nights.Anyone else get this?
Signal	After trying just about every over the counter/natural supplement I finally decided to go to my doctor and he put me on prescription meds to help me sleep. It’s been about 3 weeks and I’m still getting only 2-3 hours of sleep 4-5 nights a week. I might try increasing my dose but was wondering if anyone has tried biofeedback or hypnosis for their insomnia
NotSignal	Over the past few months I've been trying to maximize the amount of sleep I get and how fast I fall asleep into sleep. I've noticed great changes from it, so here's what I've done.*1. Purchasing an orthopedic pillow*I ordered an orthopedic pillow from [Saturn Sleepers] (https://saturnsleepers.com/products/orthopedic-neck-pillow-memory-foam-immediately-improves-sleep) and noticed help falling asleep on my first night compared to my usual pillow. It was very comfy. I've also noticed more efficient sleep, having more energy from less sleep (8 hours instead of 9). I recommend these pillows for anyone who has problems falling asleep and during asleep - it seemed to work for me!*2. A no brainier - no technology for an hour before bed*This really helped me get to fall asleep faster and is something that I had been meaning to do for a long time, but is very hard since I'm addicted to my phone.*3. A ritual before bed*
Signal	I'm not too sure what has been causing my sleep deprivation but I suspect its a mixture of stress, hormones, late-night gaming, family issues and genetics. For over a week I would stay awake till 3 or 4am in the morning and hope that my own mind wouldn't betray me and allow to me to rest.The hardest part was when I was fully awake for over 30hrs and my mind was darting off with a hundred different thoughts and there was no one to talk to. I hadn't smoked in 3 weeks but that night broke me and and at 8am when there was still morning frost I rushed to nearest corner shop to find relief. I understand smoking is not good for me but I had no other alternative and it is extremely difficult to get by without it (personal experience).Yesterday I went to the doctor's and they prescribed me phenergran and mirtazapine. From what the pharmacist told me, phenegran is a sleep aid and mirtazapine is an antidepressant. I decided to take 2 tablets of phenegran yesterday and I've slept the best since this whole shitstorm started. Slept for an uninterrupted 11 hours and could finally return to dreamland. I'm against the use of antidepressants as I think they force an unnatural happiness on you, I believe the cause of my problem is sleep and the phenergran really helps with that.
Signal	For some reason it always happens to me.I slept at 6am today, and suddenly woke up at 9am stressed out and wasn't able to go back to sleep anymore. Spent all day feeling like shit, good thing it's a sunday. When i walked out today though and looked up the sky, lo and behold, it's a huge ass full moon.
NotSignal	I understand but damn it’s lonely and anxiety inducing. It’s extra bad tonight/this morning and I had to text my manager I couldn’t come in this morning and I’m just not sure if I’m thinking straight and I’m worried I’m going to lose my job.
Signal	So, for the past year I’ve had digestive issues and I’ve lost a lot of weight. I’ve lost 60 pounds since exactly one year ago, and I cannot go to the bathroom hardly at all. I get full very easily when I eat food, and it sometimes is painful to eat.I’m 4 pounds underweight and I wonder if this induced some sort of anxiety that keeps me from falling asleep easily and staying asleep. I can tell I lack REM sleep because I get headaches even if I do sleep for like 6 hours...I’ve had to do a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and CT scan just to figure out what’s wrong with me the first two showed nothing and I’m hoping that my recent CT scan will show somethingI genuinely believe whatever I’m going through has triggered intense anxiety for me making everything much more difficultI noticed I started waking up earlier and earlier the more I lost weight
NotSignal	I personally need some noise to fall asleep. Usually with something playing (Twitch, YouTube, music). Would anyone be interested in audio recordings of stories being read in a calm, bedtime like manner? I've had this idea kicking around for awhile, but basically it'd be 20-30 minute videos on YouTube of just audio. I was thinking of using popular fan fiction stories from popular universes and making it non-monetized. It'll probably be rough to start with since there'll be a lot to learn and improve on in every area. Does anyone with anxi (or SO's, kids, etc) think they'd be interested in that?
NotSignal	I drank last weekend and i had problems sleeping after the night out, now since then i’ve had this problem that i’m tired af but can’t sleep these couple of days after drinking. Can the alcohol cause that for that long?
Signal	Can someone just tells me it gets better? I spend all day anxious out of my mind about not sleeping, then go to bed and can barely sleep and it keeps going like this everyday? I’m seeing a psychologist for the last 3 weeks and the things he tells me aren’t helping I can’t take away the anxiety it’s always there. I just want it to go away. So if anyone’s been through it and come out on the other side please tell me
Signal	...that when I go to bed at 6am to 12pm, I sleep for a full 8 hours or even longer.But when I go to bed at a DECENT time, like 9pm or hell, even 1-4am, I'm asleep for 2 hours tops (maybe 4 if I'm lucky) then wake up and can't get back to sleep.And THEN I'm wide awake for the next 3-5 hours (at best) or 10-20 minutes (at worst) before spending the rest of ~~my life~~ the day in a state of permanent fatigue, but then I know I can't fall asleep again because if I do, I'll wake up at midnight with a pounding, unceasing headache.
Signal	I've tried trazodone, temazepam, sonata, doxepin and now belsomra 20mg with no relief. I'm also prescribed 100mg pristiq, adderall (IR which I make sure my last dose is well before bedtime), PRN xanax (1mg BID that I rarely take on a daily basis).Has anyone else found relief for severe insomnia? I work night shift so I also try to make sure I stay on a routine sleep schedule but that usually ends up with me laying in bed for hours with maybe 2-4 hours of sleep per night and crashing on my day off for 12 hours once a week. It's my first week taking the belsomra but I was hoping this medication would have more of an immediate effect on my inability to fall and stay asleep.Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!
NotSignal	So I’m normally an easy sleeper, but the last three days I have gotten maybe 2-3 hours of sleep overall and I don’t know what to do. Technically not insomnia but I don’t know where else to go and hope I can get some advice. Long story short I hurt my right oblique muscle (muscle around chest/ribs). Went to doctor, got an X-ray, and I basically just have to wait it out and treat it with painkillers, heat pads, etc. Problem is because of the pain and swelling, I cant lie down. I cant lie on my back, front or the injured side without risking making it worse, but even when I sleep on the left side of my body which Im supposed to, I cant. The entire time it either hurts, my back gets stiff and very uncomfortable, or i have trouble breathing due to the swelling. Its been three days with almost no sleep. Im miserable and I really need help. Sorry if this isnt the right place, i just dont know where else to go, and googling positions to sleep to help pain management has done nothing.
NotSignal	I have been having sleep disorders since March. For some unknown reason my heart starts racing up when I'm just about to fall asleep (and I can feel the blood pumping through all my body) which lasts a few minutes. This can happen multiple times in a row until I can finally fall asleep. During the day I'm completely normal and feel no problems on my body.There is nothing concerning my mind (at least in an active way) and I'm unable to associate this problem to anything psychological. I've already gone to a doctor which made me do some blood tests and heart exams. They were both fine (a bit low on Vitamin D but I'm already taking meds for that).After finding no issues with those exams, the doctor required a thyroid exam to check if there is any hormonal unbalance (Hypothyroidism) that might be causing this problem, but everything was normal. I also did an ultrasound exam and the doctor detected a lump of 11mm on my thyroid which requires examination later this year to make sure it's not growing (at the time of the check it seemed benign, the doctor told me not to worry about as it is not uncommon) - I'm not sure that it can have some impact on this situation or not.When I got back to the "original" doctor with the results she told me that nothing out of the ordinary is showing up on record and that is most likely anxiety related. I was prescribed with some medicine to help in falling asleep but they are not very effective, I still fill the heart pumping almost every night. Unfortunately I was unable to proceed with appointments due to covid-19 restrictions and I'm unsure what to try to improve my situation.Is there anyone else that has gone through a similar situation? Can it can be Insomnia? I'm 28 years old, generally healthy but this situation is really bringing me down both physically and mentally. Many thanks!
Signal	It is currently Sunday the 7th, 5:56AM at the start of this writing. I’m on about 3 hours of sleep since Friday night. For over a decade now, my sleep has been progressively getting worse. I frequently pull all-nighters. It’s affecting my energy, of course, and deteriorating my mental health and stability. I find myself in states like these to be almost manic with constantly looming depression and anxiety, all at the same time. I’ve tried to fall asleep, only to toss and turn and get frustrated and break down crying. I just wish someone was here to tell me I’m okay, and help calm me down. Sigh, tearing up as I write this. It’s such a uniquely helpless feeling that is so intangible yet so heavy on my mind. It becomes a cycle of self-beratement and constant disappointment of “I need to fix this,” “I need to sleep,” “WHY IS THIS SO HARD,” and “I’ll stay up today. Sleep early tomorrow. I’ll get this right.” I feel truly helpless. It’s affecting my relationships. It’s killing my energy and motivation. It exacerbated my anxiety and depression. My memory is shot the f*ck out. And I can’t seem to find a solution, with no one to blame but myself it seems. I feel this brooding desire to cry that comes out when I can’t control it. I find myself with tears coming down my face, not knowing why I’m sad or crying in the first place. It’s clearly affecting my stability and it’s so difficult to combat this in an effective way. The quarantine and unemployment hasn’t helped my case... I’m on my computer pretty much the entire time I’m awake. I probably stay up because of it and I’d agree there, but for the last few months it feels more like I simply don’t feel sleepy so what else is there to do? Not the best logic, I know. But it’s incredibly discouraging when I actually feel sleepy, attempt to sleep at a reasonable time, only to almost instantly lose the sleepiness the second I hit the bed and try to pass out. The *teeeeny* tiny silver lining is that I’ve been seeing a therapist (good for managing and reframing emotions, not very affective for sleep) and that I’ve finally gained access to healthcare after 10 years without. I don’t really know anything about sleep medication so, if anyone has some insight to share about it I’d appreciate it very much (I’ll be doing my own research too and lurk around here a bit!). Im not entirely sure why I’m writing this other than the fact that writing my thoughts down sometimes helps. I hope it portrays one perspective of insomnia, and how difficult it is to live with this. I need help and I’m seeking it, I suppose this is one of the ways I’m doing it. It’d help me tremendously to hear any words of encouragement, knowledge, or just comfort by sharing your struggle. I feel like an incompetent loser that can’t even do something as simple as *sleep*, and everyone in my life seems to have no problem sleeping at all. This just makes me feel like I’m f*cked in the head and something’s wrong with me. I have no way to find solace in the fact that I’m not alone, even if I know there’s millions of strangers who may be going through the same, if not similar thing. It’s nice to have written this out. Thank you for reading the ramblings of a deliriously sleep-deprived sulk. I wish you a deep sleep and a good night’s rest. PS I apologize if this comes off too strong. I’m a very emotional guy and being so sleep-deprived seems to only amplify that trait. I know some of this isn’t easy to read because my thoughts are all over the place.
Signal	I’m so upset, I was anxious all night about working today and I only slept 1 or so hours. I have a ten hour work day in a field where I have to be super present and sharp. I want to call out sick but it doesn’t feel like an option.
Signal	I've had sleep issues going back to my teen years. Was once hospitlized when I took two pills that said would cause drowsiness and I was still awake and told my mom and they thought I was trying to kill myself, despite my protest of just wanting to go to sleep. I was 15.. I'm in my 40's now and sleep has always been an uphill battle. I'm on prescription sleep medication that honestly has been a miracle, because I didn't think I could just fall asleep and wake up and feel fine. But I also do sleep hygiene that also seems to work well for me. Yeah I've had to change my life a bit, but I like sleep, sleep is good, so I changed my life a bit. -No heavy meals past 6pm, for me heavy meals makes sleeping harder. -No caffeine past noon, which is so hard for me and something that I still struggle with. -No TV in the bedroom. Electronics get turned off a few hours before I want to go to bed. -Going to bed and waking up at the same time, which again is a struggle for me. -I will listen to podcasts sometimes. -Turning off my head is hard, so as silly as it sounds, I've created a fantasy world that I work on when I go to bed. One night I'm a spy, the next night I might be a pirate. Gives my mind something to think about than why am I not asleep yet or whatever issues I'm going through. - A hot bath an hour or so before bed. Relaxes my body. - Making sure the room temp is where I want it, I like a cool room, so cool it is. I do want to start meditating, but I'm not sure how to go about that because I can't turn off and just think about nothing. I still have trouble getting to sleep, medication helps, but so does the sleep hygiene that I've been doing.
NotSignal	For past one month, I have been going to bed past 4am. I tried staying awake yesterday after only having 3 hour sleep but that did not work either, I just don’t get that sleepiness feeling before 5am. My sleep cycle’s just getting worse and worse. At nights I try to fall asleep but I have too much thoughts in my head and I end up just looking at my phone. Pleaseeeeee helppp 🙏🏻
NotSignal	I’ve got a really important exam in 7 hours and I haven’t been able to sleep at all. I’m worried practically to the point of physical sickness, I just want to sleep PLEASE
Signal	I have had insomnia for a very long time. My doctor talked me into taking Xanax 1 mg for sleep. I reluctantly took it. Of course 2 weeks later, it stopped working and I had horrible rebound anxiety. He increased it to 2 mg. Same thing happened 2 weeks later. I asked to be put on Valium, so I can get off of the benzos. He thought it had a shorter half life lol. I got him to put me on Clonezepam 2 mg. I wanted a longer acting benzo, so that I could get off of it. Two weeks later, it stopped working. I didn't get the rebound anxiety until it got close to when I took the Clonezpam, since it is longer acting at least. Anyhow, I would usually go to sleep around 10, then wake up around 3am and not be able to go back to sleep until around 8am. It got worse after I lost my job. I would wake up around 12 or 1 and be up until 8a to 10a. Then I would sleep until 12p to 3p, which made my anxiety worse, and made it hard for me to accomplish anything. So I did some research and decided to ask my doctor for Lyrica during the day and night to help get me off of the Clonezpam, and with anxiety, and ask for Tizanidine for when I wake up at night. I went to another doctor and he prescribed them for me. I went to bed around 11pm last night and woke up at 5am! Which was much better. I also took half of my Clonezpam. Then I took a quarter of 40 mg of Tizanidine at 5am to help me go back to sleep. I slept until 2pm today. Luckily, I don't have anything going on lol. So, I got over 12 hours of sleep! I also had very pleasant dreams. I am going to taper off of the Clonezpam using the Ashton model, from the half dose (1 mg), and eventually switch to just taking the Tizanidine. I have been taking the benzos for 5 to 7 months now. I take the second dose of Lyrica about 2 hours earlier. The Lyrica is what helped me sleep until 5. I am going to do the same tonight but skip the Tizanidine if I sleep past 3am, and see if I can go back to sleep without it. If that doesn't work, I am going to take a very small amount of Tizanidine before I go to sleep, since I am taking 1 mg Clonezpam. I will give an update in a couple of weeks. I wanted to share this with you all. This method works with my situation, I know it wouldn't work for everyone. I hope you all can find something that works for you. Don't give up hope. Do research, try to find a doctor that will help you. I would have done a sleep study if I could have afforded it. Say no to benzos, unless they are taken only once in awhile. Good luck fellow insomniacs!
NotSignal	Which one or which combo has worked the best for you? I'd like to only take one but will most likely have to take a combo as needed.
NotSignal	I was able to sleep like around 1-2 am or even before that. Now I can’t I feel so wide awake and I’ve been in my room in the dark try to sleep this whole time since 1 am and no luck. When i try to sleep my anxiety kinda kick in but just not tired at all. Need help or advice
NotSignal	My insomnia isn’t as bad as most people here and if I am in bed for 9 hours I’ll generally get 8 hours of sleep, but wondering if anyone has advice for actually staying asleep. When I wake up it’s more of a half wake up and generally in 90 minute intervals with my sleep cycle, but I literally haven’t slept completely through a night in months. (I track my sleep with the sleep cycle app)
NotSignal	Ever since the quarantine my boyfriend and I have noticed this person laughing non stop all day and night practically, and now it seems like her laugh is louder, more frequent, and worse than ever. I'm laying here trying to sleep and she wakes me up every 5 minuets. It's driving me crazy and I can't take this shit anymore.
Signal	Hello all,Background story, I had a battle with insomnia last year which originated from coming off a prescription medication. I then developed sleep anxiety and would struggle to fall asleep. Thankfully from November last year the issue seemed to resolve and I was sleeping good amounts most nights. Last night however I was unable to sleep all night, I tossed and turned and in the end I got up at 4am and gave up! We are in the midst of a heatwave here in the UK and I struggled to get comfortable with it being so hot! I feel anxious that now this will now trigger my anxiety and insomnia again!So naturally I am seeking reassurance, to my knowledge there is nothing else that would have prevented me from sleeping last night other then the heat however previously I have struggled but always managed to fall asleep in the end. Can the heat make us unable to fall asleep?Thank you in advance x
NotSignal	I’m curious if any of you out there reading this have managed to find something that reliably helps you sleep. I have had problems sleeping my whole life and tried a lot of things:- **Warm milk**- **Melatonin**- **Benadryl/Unisom** (diphenhydramine) —to anyone reading this using Benadryl to sleep: STOP! Diphenhydramine is one of the most neurotoxic over the counter medications and has been linked to serious memory issues if used regularly/frequently. Keep Benadryl limited to allergic reactions - **Cannabis**- **Trazodone**I also make my room a black noiseless cave every night (the only light coming in is from a gap in the doorframe after sunrise), I use 2 white noise machines to drown out any sounds, I kick the cats out, and my insomnia/ light sleeping is bad enough that my boyfriend and I sleep in separate rooms most nights. I have also tried, yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, etc. I have mild/low-level anxiety from time to time, but it’s much improved from the soul crushing anxiety and depression I experienced in High School- so, I consider my mental health to be pretty good, and not the main reason for my sleeplessness. I can usually (but not always) manage to fall asleep (although it sometimes takes an hourish to fall asleep). Then I can sleep ok for a few hours, but I almost always wake up anywhere from 4:30-6:30am (sometimes due to chronic pain) then struggle to fall back to sleep (taking up to 90mins to fall back to sleep). And once I’ve been lucky enough to fall back to sleep, I frequently will wake back up once an hour before I give up on actually sleeping and get out of bed. So, for those of y’all reading this who are sleeping alright, what worked for you? The best nights sleep I’ve ever had were when someone gave me a benzodiazepine for an anxiety attack. But with the current state of controlled substances, I don’t want to be seen as a drug seeker. Are there any other medications or supplements that may help I can talk about with my doctor? I’m sorry if this comes out as a bit of a ramble, just tired and frustrated right now.
NotSignal	I've been seeing weighted blankets for anxiety and insomnia advertised quite a bit recently and finally gave in and ordered one as I still have some Christmas money. It hasn't arrived yet but I am looking forward to it because I've always liked heavy blankets and I'm hoping it will help me sleep better.Has anyone on here tried specially weighted blankets before? What do you think?
NotSignal	You go to bed at around 10 but don’t fall asleep til 2 or 3. But in those hours, you lay down with your eyes closed and check the time every once in a while. Time seems to fly really fast but you’re pretty sure you’re not sleeping. Like I lay down at 10, can’t sleep, check my watch and it’s 11:30. How did time fly that fast? Did I maybe doze off and not notice?
NotSignal	For several months I was suffering from really bad insomnia. I developed such a fear of not sleeping that I was dreading the idea of the upcoming nights. I even had panic attacks. I thought this hell will never end and that I will never be okay. But I actually did it, and without sleeping pills.I was practicing some elements from CBT-I, though altered them a bit for my needs. Plus I was working hard on my thoughts to eliminate the fear connected with insomnia. This was not a short ride, but now my nights are stable, I sleep 6-9 hours a night and feel just great.If I had to sum up my solution it would be:\- wake up at the same time (for me it was 6am, I still try to stick to this waking time).\- don't force sleep: go whenever you are tired, let it be 10 pm or 2 am.\- feel comfortable with the idea that you might not sleep tonight. This one works amazingly and, paradoxically, makes me fall asleep.I really wish I knew this earlier when my insomnia wasn't that bad.
Signal	This is what worked for me. My insomnia was caused be anxiety and depression. I didn’t leave my room and I just felt gross all the time. I would always be on my phone, whether it be on Reddit, IG, or random web surfing. I put my phone away a couple hours before bed but it didn’t work. I tried melatonin, sleep supplements, chamomile tea. Still didn’t work. For 3 weeks, I would sleep for maybe 2-3 hours a night. I tried so hard falling asleep again. I would close my eyes, do all the sleep techniques I found on the web, got up, stretched, journal, and nothing worked. I was always thinking about something and I kept on thinking about insomnia and this reddit page. For all the people reading this, get off this app for a while. Get off your phones and laptops(work is fine, but just use your technology for work). Dance, walk, keep your mind on things. People on here don’t understand how stressful phones can be. I left my phone for a couple days and started working out and my sleep slowly got better. I went from 2-3 hours of sleep to 5-6 hours. I am using my phone a lot this week because i have been sleeping more and guess what came back: my insomnia. This place can do more harm than good guys, just try leaving your phones(unless essential) for a couple days and see your results.
NotSignal	You know how some ppl have noisy neighbors then can go to and knock on their door and tell them to stfu? Well no matter how many times itri to quiet down the deafening sound of my own loneliness this hoe wont stfu!! Like i want some semblance of a circadian rhythm but when everyones asleep n the house is quiet theres a banger being thrown in my brain
NotSignal	i haven’t slept for 2 days now, i can feel my eyes closing but as soon as they close i’m wide awake. ASMR used to help me extremely with falling asleep, but it doesn’t affect me anymore. i’m just sick of always being tired. it’s 8:19 AM, i’m gonna go make breakfast. hope you all sleep well (or try to, since this is an insomnia sub)
Signal	anybody else suffering from nightmares after being on trazadone? i would do an experiment to see if i don’t have them when i don’t take my meds at night, but when i don’t take trazadone i lie in bed listening to my heart pound out of my chest sweating. help!
Signal	My sleeping medicine makes my dreams so realistic. But lately, I’ve been dreaming about a certain person a lot. I haven’t seen this person in over 5 years, it’s making me over think everything i ever did. She wasn’t a partner, she was someone I looked up to. But I wish she’d stop coming up in my dreams because it hurts, it hurts to know I will never be able to say thank you to her, she helped me through tough times even when I didn’t know I was struggling.
Signal	okay so I done fucked up, I got into this violent cycle of staying up for 36 hours then sleeping for 16 hours and it really isn't good but I've done it again and I need to stay awake until 4 pm at the minimum so how do I say awake? If you say coffee you better point me in the direction of some good shit because I have ADHD so coffee doesn't really work.(it's currently 6 am and I need to last 11 hours)I normally take prescribed sleeping meds because of this violent cycle but I can't find them and I can't get my prescription refilled for a while and normal drugstore sleeping meds either work too much or do nothing soooooo
NotSignal	Does anyone take your prescription sleep medicine with melatonin? I only get 3 or 4 hours straight sleep then is broken
Signal	Ever since last Saturday every night is a sleepless night. I'm not exaggerating either, I lay in bed at 10pm and the entire night is spent tossing and turning. The wide awake feeling most Insomniacs experience is so intense. I work at a job that is physically demanding and I've started walking 6 miles. Because If I dont walk. I'll fall asleep at 6am for two hours and I'm not supposed to nap. But the moment I go to bed all the sleep pressure I built up for the entire night is gone. And I don't drink caffine either. I not only have to drive to work but I have to move fast at work too. I'm trying my best to not think about my Insomnia but the intense wide awake sensation makes it near impossible for me to stay calm. It all feels subconscious aka out of my control. How do I break this cycle?
NotSignal	Hey all,How would I properly sleep on my back with a mattress that isn't so firm? Would I place an extra pillow under my knees AND lower back?
NotSignal	Hi all, a friend and I want to start a podcast with scary stories to keep you up at night (sort of like nosleep). One name we have in the running is “The Insomnia Report.” Would this be offensive to people with insomnia? I don’t want to make light of something that I know many people really struggle with. What are your thoughts on this?
Signal	I started experiencing insomnia after my last baby was born over a year ago. Long story short, about 2 weeks into not sleeping more than an hour a night, I started experiencing severe anxiety when I was in my bed not sleeping. I had several panic attacks in bed and it resulted in me going to the living room couch. I told myself that I’d give myself grace about sleeping on the couch but I assumed that by the time my baby was a year old I would be able to sleep in my bed.I have rearranged my entire bedroom, got new bed linens, new pictures on the walls, etc. to try and make myself not associate the bedroom with anxiety I felt before.... but it hasn’t worked. Just walking into my bedroom at night fills me with panic and I end up back on the couch. The other day I tried to lay in bed and felt like I was crawling out of my skin and couldn’t breathe.I’m still struggling nightly with insomnia but the couch feels “safe” to me for some reason. I don’t know why, since I’ve had many sleepless nights on the couch too.I’m sure this is something other people have experienced but I guess I’d like to feel not so alone. I feel weird for sleeping on the couch and not in the bed with my husband.
NotSignal	Took me 5 fucking hours to get to sleep last night despite the remeron someone throw me off a fucking bridge
Signal	I can’t take this anymore. I’m on the brink of suicide because I can’t fucking sleep. I can’t function at all; I haven’t been to school in a month. I hate this so fucking much. If there is a merciful god, then my afterlife will be constant, endless sleep.
Signal	I was using melatonin for about three years consistently. After I was having trouble sleeping still I stopped and it intermittently. Then I found a longer lease one, and that seems to work. Lately the melatonin has been making me really tired.I’ve been trying to test the melatonin by trying really hard to remember my dreams and what happened that night when I take it. I noticed that my dreams are crazy with so many of them being bizarre and sort of like a nightmare.A chiropractor docotor. Advise me a few months ago that melatonin can cause nightmares. After I was advised this I stopped taking it. But still continue to have trouble sleeping. I tried a few nights on it and a few nights off. And noticed most of the time my dreams are crazy when I take it.I hope just because my doctor said that it might cause nightmares that I’m not making myself have nightmares because of what they said. But I can’t find any of the side effects online. But this isn’t a big deal just curious if anybody had this happen to them. Maybe because I was taking the melatonin for a very long time not sure.
NotSignal	Hello all. I recently started playing games like 'Among Us' and 'Monopoly', which are pretty chill games to play. I play them casually, to get my mind off things or to kill some time. But ever since I started playing these games, I get dreams related to these games, and I wake up mid-sleep and I keep thinking about them and I am unable to get back to sleep, forcing me to get out of bed with just 3 hours of sleep and I end up sleeping for 5+ hours in the afternoon. How can i tackle this issue?
NotSignal	So i started having trouble falling asleep at night like 2 months ago. I would lay awake til 4-7am trying to sleep. But now i fixed it thankfully cuz i do yoga and sleep meditation before bed, im able to fall asleep around 11pm-12am, but now i wake up at 3am-6am randomly for no reason. It takes me like 2-4 hours to go back to sleep. Whats happening to me?? This has been going on for 8 days straight now. Is this normal since i just finished finding a way to make my body sleep at a proper sleep schedule or ?? im really confused. tips please!
NotSignal	So basically I haven’t slept , like skipped the whole night and now it’s 10am, I have a date tomorrow though so I was trying to fix my sleep schedule for that, and just in general I know falling asleep now would just keep the chain going so I thought maybe I should drink coffee or take an adderal (it’s prescribed) or something to keep from passing out rn, should I or would that make it worse?
Signal	Why is it so messed up that I just cannot no matter how much I try go to damn sleep. I always feel tired when I need to get up. Been an insomniac for many years now and I just can't take this.
NotSignal	My friend has been having difficulties sleeping and she barely sleeps, she's been like that for a while. She sleeps for 2-5 hours per day and sometimes she can't get some sleep at all. I was wondering if there is something wrong with her? I find it strange that she's not able to sleep even when she's purely exhausted, tired or even dizzy. As for her health background, I am going to mention couple of things aabout her, perhaps any of you have experienced this.My friend is Bulimic for like 5 years. She tends to eat a large amount of food and then purge them out. Lately she has been trying to fight the urge and forces herself to eat without purging. However, she eat a limited amount of calories, not efficient amount, around 500-700 calories per day. She told me that she is able to sleep once she purges the food out of her system. The other days, when she eats 500-700 calories, she tends to not sleep properly, in fact she gets a 2-5 hours rest, sometimes she doesn't sleep at all. I was wondering if this is the causes of food? I've tried to research about it online but i haven't found anything regarding it.Has any of you experienced this or have came across someone who experienced it? I just want to know if food is the main cause or if its something else. Thank you in advance.
Signal	its 4:30, I did fall asleep for just a couple hours, so I dunno if that makes me an insomniac but this has becoming more of a regular occurrence. waking up with panic, sweating, tossing and turning... dread. indigestion. how do people sleep during times like this? so many people getting sick & unable to afford health care. loneliness becoming an epidemic & dying alone, scared. and now we've got the war drums being pounded, with rampant narcissism. I know all these worries are topics that are mostly due to my own personal struggles... being single for years, ignored, living alone... I always had hope that I was the freak and it was all in my head, and I could overcome things with optimism and putting others first,. but that hope is disappearing as I see it happening more & more and any sacrifices being pointless. Ive tried to distract myself with the internet too, visiting the far corners where this worries are never mentioned, but that hasn't fixed anything. anyways, I found it comforting to see posts here at this hour, no hate, and I just wanted to say something. I appreciate you guys posting here. thank you.
NotSignal	whenever i don't go to uni im unable to sleep only 2-3 hours or even none sometimes, given the current situation i get 4-5 days of rly bad sleep or no sleep at all , and i don't know how to cope with it, uni keeps me busy for 8-10 hours, but now all i do is play videogames and go for walks and thats it, i feel so busy in my head at night its soooo frustrating... anyone else having this experience for 3 months now?
Signal	Hi everyone, I’m new to this sub. I’ve suffered from insomnia for as long as I can remember but it got much worse as I got older. When I was a child it usually took me 3 hours to fall asleep, now i fall asleep in about 5 hours or I can legitimately go the entire night without sleeping. I don’t want to continue taking pills, smoking, or drinking to fall asleep. I also don’t want to be in my bed counting sheep all night either. I don’t want to jump through hoops meditating, lighting candles, and putting myself in the right “head space”. I don’t want to draw a bath in my gross apartment bathtub that I share with a roommate or distract myself. It’s so much WORK. I work all day just to come home to work to fall asleep. From now on, if I’m not sleepy AT ALL, I’m gonna watch the next couple episodes of my Netflix show. I’m over it. I’m sick of feeling like my nights are suffering. If I’m not tired I’m gonna do something enjoyable. The next day is gonna suck either way because I’ll be overwhelmingly exhausted. If I stay up until the sun comes up then so be it. Anyone else feel this way?
Signal	For a while I thought I had insomnia but I don’t think so anymore. I saw something on this sub about DSPD and it just kinda clicked for me. For a few months now I can not go to sleep before 2 am. I can take a little nap but I always wake up after an hour or two. As of now sometimes I stay up to even 7am desperately and anxiously trying to sleep but it sometimes feels impossible. The second part is that I can’t wake up before 11am, when I do I usually just fall back asleep. Most days I’m waking up around 12 pm. And this brings the third question, even if I have DPSD can you have both that and insomnia at the same time? Even by DSPD standards struggling to fall asleep after 4am to even 6 and 7 seems way too much.
Signal	I have been using Ambien successfully for more than 15 years. Every few months or years when the tolerance increases too high (more than 10-15mg/night) I quit cold turkey, and this works. It's always been rough, but this time around it's been just an awful experience. My tolerance had increased to 30mg in the past year. I quit cold turkey 2-3 days ago, as my medical clinic stopped approving a new prescription (they appeal to covid-19 related emergency regulations). The doctor wouldn't allow me to even taper off, so cold turkey was the only option.The past 48-72 hours have been awful:*1st night:* I took only the remaining 10mg (tolerance by now was at 30mg). A difficult night, some nightmares and wake-ups, but I did manage to sleep around 6-7 hours. Not too bad.*2nd night (cold turkey):* Takes me until 7am to fall asleep after tossing around my bed for 8 hours. By the time I finally fall asleep, I am pulled into an incredible rollercoaster of a vivid nightmare which lasts for hours: **Sleep paralysis:** I am half-awake in my room, but I cannot move my body. A large shadowy man climbing on top of me, I feel an ***impending sense of doom*****.** **Lucid dreaming:** I know I am dreaming and paralysed, so I try to consciously wake myself up by moving my arm enough to pinch my wrist. I try for ages with no success, but finally I manage to pinch myself for long enough to get out of the terror... Takes me a few minutes to fully wake up, and get myself up to the kitchen to drink water, calm down, and try sleeping again. Next comes another vivid, movie-roll of a nightmare that lasts for a long time and which always loops back to the beginning: **Extreme nightmare/terror:** Among the most vivid, horrific, brutal nightmare that I have ever experienced, you feel ashamed and surprised by what your own mind can create.. I cycle through the same storyline for an hour or so, experiencing vivid **lucid dreaming:** ie. I again knew that I was trapped in the nightmare, and during each 'replay/loop', I try consciously to wake myself up. It was odd, actually: with every replay my mind 'learned' that when this or that moment happens in that nightmare, that's the best moment to try wake myself up. It's like there was a specific moment in a long horror movie, where you know you can press pause, and try exit the film: but when you do that, a hacker takes control of your devices and you are not allowed to end the film, but instead are forced to sink even deeper into even more brutal imagery; and at that point you know that you will have to live through the full replay again from the beginning. It's an awful experience, magnified by constant terror, impending sense of doom, sleep paralysis, and extreme nightmare*.* I have never had such an experience of paralysis / lucid nightmare before to this degree. I managed to 'sleep' like this for about 5-6 hours. Felt groggy, anxious, depressed (crying fits, suicidal thoughts), restless legs and arms, exhausted for the entire rest of the day.*3rd night (last night):* I fall asleep around 5am after tossing in my bed for 5 hours. The dreams were less awful and violent overall, but there were some few vivid, dark violent scenes (that I don't want to repeat here..). No sleep paralysis. At some point I started lucid dreaming, trying again consciously to wake myself up from the dream at the moment when I realised that things were turning horrid again. It was a bit easier to pinch myself awake this time. I slept 6 hours. Feeling a bit more rested and less depressed as I write this, but I can feel that the exhaustion is creeping on me after being awake for 3 hours now. I anticipate another difficult night. \---So now I am at the 76th hour of my cold turkey. Also, today I no longer feel the craving for Ambien, instead I feel kind of repulsed by the thought of taking it (this is a first!). Oddly enough, my usually puffy ankles are less puffy today. Legs are a bit less restless, maybe. Also my head is a bit clearer, even though I am quite tired. I have read on the internet, that often the 3-5th days are the most difficult. I anticipate another difficult night tonight, but I also hope that the worst is over. I am a bit worried about rebound insomnia, parasomnia and depression/anxiety increasing over the next 2-3 weeks.Will try to get some exercise today, and reduce caffeine in the afternoon. Pity I have to work again tomorrow, as I am worried that I won't be fit enough.. (deadlines are pending so I will have to try)
NotSignal	Out of curiosity. How long have you had insomnia for? What were the worst days, by what I mean by that is how many days have you guys have gone with no sleep before if any?
Signal	So yeah, last night I took a pill which contains 2mg of melatonin and also some vitamin B6 and 5HTP griffonia.It doesn't knocked me out like a sleeping pill but it did help me to get 7 hours of good quality of sleep according to my smart band.The only problem is that I felt kinda down and sleepy throughout the whole day. Which kinda misses the point...I don't know if I should continue to take it. Maybe it's a side effect that is supposed to wear off after a few days ? I don't know...
Signal	I can’t sleep at night if i did its only 2 or 3 hours i cant tell also its fucking 3:33 am and i cant even sleep
Signal	Hey there! So I have insomnia induced by severe panic attacks that occur at night either when I am asleep or in the process of falling asleep. It has been like this for me for about five months now. It’s gotten a bit better and I haven’t had a full blown panic attack in about 4 weeks!Anyway, I haven’t slept anywhere but my house in this five month period since this has been happening and now I’m going to stay with some extended family at their house for the weekend. Any tips on sleeping in a new place when you have sleep problems to begin with. Especially when anxiety is involved. Thanks in advance!
NotSignal	i could write an entire rant about how much life sucks rn but ill just leave it at that
NotSignal	Is this a genetic mutation in some people or is that normally part of the circadian rhythm? I noticed if I sleep 6-7 hours my body automatically wakes up and I cannot go back to sleep until im up for a few hours and can’t go back to sleep until much later whether thats expending energy or creating new energy and refreshing my system by eating/drinking. I assume this is just a normal thing like the whole heart rate increasing to 120 during the digestion process which is normal but something I noticed since everyone has apple watches now. I assume its just like that, just a normal part of the circadian rhythm nobody notices or talks about.
NotSignal	I'm always too hot at night. Are there any types of food that cool your body? And types that warm the body that I should avoid? I'm guessing coffee warms body because it's a stimulant. Well, what foods do the opposite?
Signal	2 nights ago i couldnt sleep and just decided to go with it and stay awake, the rest of the day was a pretty busy summer hot day, i didnt feel tired like at all, but once i got home i felt extremely exhausted, and eventually fell asleep at 7 pm with complete ease, literally just decided “im gonna sleep now” then next thing i remember is waking up at 9am, i slept for 14 hours. is this unhealthy, and if so, in what way and how? bcoz it was the easiest i’ve fallen asleep since i was a kid. the only problem i think will ocur is that exhaustion i got once i got home will worsen and worsen.
NotSignal	I spend lots of time laying in bed thinking of things I could be doing, like cleaning or work or exercise or basically anything but I still while away hours just lying in bed not sleeping. What do people do to pass the time?
NotSignal	It’s currently spring break so I have no obligation to get up at a reasonable hour, so I’m getting more sleep, but during school times I regularly stay up until 3-4 AM only to have to get up at 7:30 for school. Is it insomnia if I’m just on my phone? Or is that just me being addicted to my phone? It’s currently 5:10 AM And I’ve been awake since 10 AM.
NotSignal	like, what do sleep hallucinations feel like? how does one know that they're hallucinations and not just regular dreams?
Signal	I've found that I have a window of sleepiness. Because of numerous health issues, I'm pretty much constantly tired, but sleepiness is a problem. It hits me out of nowhere, like a brick in a sock, and if I don't go to bed and go to sleep in the next 15-20 minutes, my window passes and I get too tired to feel sleepy any more and then can't sleep. Explaining this to anyone that doesn't suffer from insomnia makes me sound crazy. Trying to explain that "tired" and "sleepy" are different things is a headache.
Signal	Hi, I’ve been suffering from anxiety for 3 years now but the last 3 weeks have been the worst mixed with insomnia. I’d normally sleep throughout the day, however now I’m trying to go to sleep the same time every night and I’m rarely getting any sleep. I’ll nod off for an hour or two, and then wake up around the same time. For example, it’s 9am right now and I’m not sure if I’ve been staring at the ceiling for 6-8 hours or actually fell back sleep a few times. I’m on Citalopram and have recently been prescribed Zopiclone this week, which is the only reason I can get a few hours at most. Got such heavy pains in my legs and back too, which obviously causes health anxiety what doesn’t help the situation. I’ve tried staying awake through the day, hot baths before bed and breathing techniques but meh. Can anybody help?
NotSignal	If you're bothered by something like, let's say a ticking clock on a boiler inside your room, a good workaround is to actually listen to it. Yep, you heard me. Try to use the ticking as an anchor. Breathe in five seconds, out five seconds. When you feel like it, increase this breathing to maybe then seconds or whatever you're comfortable with.Slow your breathing until eventually you start to feel relaxed. If you feel itchy or uncomfortable, try not to move. This is your bodies "roll over" response and listening to it will keep you awake.This isn't the easiest method but it's a one I've personally found helps me. Just thought I'd share this if anybody else has had a problem with clocks or other rhythmic ambient noises.Doesn't always work, but I find even if my thoughts are spinning around like crazy, eventually I can manage to enter a semi meditative state with this and I can fall asleep a bit easier on some nights.Take care, all.
NotSignal	So I’ve never experienced sleep paralysis but I’m afraid of it happening to me. I know and try to remind myself that it’s a small possibility that I’ll get sleep paralysis and an even smaller possibility that I will experience any of the things talked about in horror stories of sleep paralysis online. Nonetheless the possibility still exists and keeps me up at night. It’s also one of the reasons I sleep on my stomach or side and cover myself up with the blanket because atleast if it does happen I won’t have to worry about seeing things. Anyways Ik this seems like some sort of baby thing that I have to get over so I ask for your help in doing so.
Signal	Been taking it for around 3 months, 5mg at first, then 10 mg, 20mg for the last month. I've been doing dumb shit while on it and I have no recollection in the morning which I hate. I'd like to taper off it.I'm also taking Bupropion, Desvenlafaxine, Etizolam and Lexapro.
NotSignal	My normal sleep pattern is that I'm awake for an average of 72 hours and then sleep for about 5 hours. I try to truly sleep but that never seems to happen. Ambien doesn't work. I've been this way for many years. Anti anxiety meds do work but the side effects can be more detrimental than the lack of sleep. I don't know what to do.
Signal	Went to bed at 11PM. Woke up at 3AM to go to the bathroom. Haven't been able to fall asleep since and the sun is rising. Just got my wisdom teeth out and I need sleep and yet I can't seem to get itIgnore me, I'm just venting
NotSignal	My schedule is flexible, and of course it allows me to do it... but it sucks, coz my day literally starts at noon. I don't get as much sunlight as I wanted, and most of services close at 5. So it's tough. I get my 7-8 hours of sleep daily, and I do feel refreshed and everything... but just wanted to shift it to, say midnight to 8 am... anyone has done this?
Signal	It kept me up all night My doctor prescribed lunesta 3mg for insomnia. I am also on seroquel and doxipen for sleep. I was hallucinating all night and felt fully awake. Not only did it not work but it made me not even feel the effects of my other sleep meds. I literally have been up all night haven’t slept one second. So should I give lunesta one more shot next night or not risk 2 nights with 0 sleep. Thanks
Signal	I wish I could just go to the hospital. Have them drug me and watch me so nothing happens so I can get sleep. I’m so tired, yet I can’t sleep.
NotSignal	I have a fucked up sleep schedule so today because of heat and summer things i couldn't sleep, i felt great in the morning while thought i was going to be completely tired, why?
NotSignal	hey folx. so, over the past 4-6 years, i had pretty bad mental health problems. one of the biggest side effects for me was insomnia. (especially for the past 2-3 years. i'd have months of 2-4 hours of sleep, and not surprisingly, didn't function well). i don't like who i've become, and feel lost. just wondering if anyone else has had personality/self changes after months/years of insomnia. wishing you all health, wellness, and strength during this difficult time of covid-19.
Signal	I’m freaking exhausted. During the day it feels like I got hit by a bus because I didn’t get enough sleep. I’m the type of person that does not function well off of little sleep. I can be exhausted at night but still struggle with falling asleep. My routine includes watching YouTube videos off of my laptop for an hour or two until I catch myself dozing off. Sometimes when this happens, as soon as I put the laptop away, my brain is wide awake again and I can’t fall asleep...even though I was literally falling asleep moments before that. Once I do go to sleep I wake up several times throughout the night. Just kind of in and out of sleep. What makes it worse is I am a very light sleeper. If my boyfriend sets his alarm to wake up early, he likes to hit the snooze button a few times before actually getting up and then I feel like I’m being tortured because it wakes me up every time too. I feel like I sleep better when I have the bed to myself but I don’t want to sleep separately because I feel like by putting that physical separation between us at night, it makes us less intimate emotionally overall. Just something I’ve noticed when we’ve done it before.I don’t know what the solution is. The idea of a bigger bed sounds helpful but there’s no room for it. I would like to stay away from sleeping pills if I can help it, even though I’ve had to turn to them a lot. I should also mention, in the morning I get so worked up from his alarm going off several times that my anger and frustration keeps me up. Either that or I’m hungry and then I can’t focus on falling back asleep because of it. I’ve always had an overactive mind and I don’t know how to stop it.
Signal	As we are in this subreddit, it is safe to assume that none of us sleep well. Same is true for me. However, for the past two weeks, I’ve only been getting 2-3 hours a night as opposed to the 6-7 I would get if I took something to help me sleep. It’s horrendous. I wake up after such a short sleep and head to work to have a full day and then drive home. Most days if I lay on my bed after work I WILL fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion but it’s short lived because I must shower and then down my bed, etc before I can sleep again. But that process wakes me up. And then I’m up until after 4am again. Every 3-4 days like this, I will crash. Most recent was last Saturday. I felt physically unable to get off the bed. I got off at 3 pm. Wasted the whole day. And the sleep was not restful. Today is another day where I cannot seem to stay awake. I’m at work. And I have never felt this irritated in my entire life. Just the thought of anyone trying to have a conversation with me makes me want to scream. I truly feel like a cranky baby. This sucks. Absolutely sucks. I just wanted to share this with people who will understand and not reply with “well if you’re tired just go sleep then, it’s not that hard” 🙃
NotSignal	Well been about two full weeks and in 14 days ive had probably max two hours of sleep a night. My body feels fine and i feel like im functioning but things are starting to slip. The other day I avoided everyone because i literally couldnt think. I mean things would just not form but i was constantly saying things out loud and random bs would just cycle through my head too fast to register. Needless to say I was concerned and i think i might have waited too long to see a doctor. So heres hoping something can help.
Signal	My sleep disorders are spiraling out of control for me during this pandemic and I am out of work and wonder if I can get back to work.I wake up and I'm too tired to think so I close my eyes and I'm playing Doom 2 in a completely random map created by my own brain. I can't see much but I know I'm doing it as I can definitely hear it. All it was a game I recently was playing but it's filled this void of sorts.I try to go back to bed but my brain seizes and I jerk every 20 seconds. I've learned to deal with this over the last couple years but it's getting to be too much...I fell "asleep" twice tonight and that's where my mind goes to dark places. As soon as I fall asleep I transcend reality. I leave my bed and that's where the fun begins. I can see things, but only in maybe how the blind could. I "see" outlines, but nothing tangential as in a normal REM dream.Maybe I'll dig face down feet into and around the floor like a large worm in pursuit of trying to form a lucid dream. Sometimes I can fly and I'm never sure if I'm thrashing about the house. My memory of my place is represented in faint outlines and includes things that sometimes aren't there. I wanted to fuck an old ex just tonight in one of these situations, was flying around trying to leave my apartment to find him until I saw my door open and my brain jerks awake. Finally awake, I haven't left my bed. This kind of terrifies me because somnambulism is never what I want to do. The above is never a normal dream. It's scary and happens shortly after I fall asleep. I've also experienced "exploding head syndrome" on top of this. Those are the worst. It's hard to go back to sleep after.WTF gives? I'm non-24 and have nearly every sleep disorder under the sun. The best even Stanford could prescribe me is CBT but it seems like my brain is in too dark of a place where that could help.
NotSignal	I'm writing this with around 4 hours of sleep. I have been diagnosed with insomnia for 5 years. I've tried everything from tea, from not using my phone, to yoga, to diffrent diets, to mealtonin. I either take forever to sleep or sleep easily and keep waking up during the night i feel really hopeless and idk what to do anymore
NotSignal	I’m already at 10mg, and the past month or so it’s just completely stopped working for me. I’m struggling more than ever with sleep and I was wondering if anyone had other alternatives?
Signal	I wanna get help and my therapist has encouraged me to talk to my mom and go visit a doctor for it. Though I’m afraid I’m gonna be brushed off. Everyone always says “get yourself on a schedule! Make yourself tired! Don’t sleep during the day and don’t drink any caffeine!” Ok I’ve tried all of those things Karen. Melatonin doesn’t work, I don’t wanna have to continuously take over the counter medication because that becomes costly having to buy more and more if it. I’ve done the whole no caffeine and stay up all day shit it hardly works (it’s either I end up staying up all night or I sleep for two hours or less and end up being awake for the rest of the night).What does it take for me to not be brushed off? I’ve tried every possible thing that doesn’t involve me taking anything other than melatonin and nothing works. I’m tired of being like this, I’m tired of dreading night time because I can’t sleep.
Signal	I have bad insomnia I'm 40f been having proems sleeping since I was 8 that's when I had my first tback surgery I had 6 total and been in out of hospitals all my life basically at nights I take 2 Tylenol PMs 2 benedryl my back muscles relaxer flexaril and 4 melatonin yes all at once and I still can feel fully rested and don't fall asleep fast and wake several times and can't go back to sleep :( can someone please help what should I do
NotSignal	Just changed my thin blanket to a thick one and it significantly improved my sleep up to 5+ hours at best. My point is to identify if you need some modifications in your bed and not focus too much on sleeping 💊 pills. :)
Signal	I’m sorry but I don’t understand how yous can feel normal or okay after going so long without sleep... Since my insomnia my eyes burn like hell all day everyday yet I still can’t fall asleep...I feel like I’m living ground hog day everyday😭😭😭
Signal	So insomnia has been very bad this week been taking melatonin to try to sleep without any success. So I called the doctor and told him what was going on. He prescribed me paxil for my anxiety and a low dose of ambien for sleep. Never taking either. When this first started a few years ago I was given hydroxyzine 25mg which sort of helped. It didn't knock me out but it got me some sleep. What should I expect?
Signal	I (F22) have been dealing with insomnia since forever. I'm not entirely sure when it started. It's okay when I'm on a schedule and working, usually I'm tired enough after that that I can sleep, but with covid-19 I lost my job and can't rely on that. When I try to sleep my body will "sleep" but my mind won't shut up. I have anxiety disorders as well as chronic depression. I've never been tested but I'm pretty sure I'm ADHD. I don't take any meds or supplements to help and I'm not sure where to start with all of that, or if I even need them. Looking for advice? Or maybe just someone to sympathize. I don't know.
NotSignal	It's been 11 days since I have pulled an all nighterAll nighter are really easy for me to do because I thrive at night I always want to clean something or sing a whole album or draw or something elseThere was one point where I stayed up for 5 days straightThis is my longest streak this year so someone be proud of me because my family does not understand why I'm so proud
Signal	Over the past 3 nights I've only been able to sleep for three hours or less and woke up with racing thoughts and a rapid heartbeat. My thoughts during these wake-periods lean toward fear or sometimes just loony or chaotic. When I am able to sleep I will jolt back awake, or experience sleep paralysis. This has been happening periodically (2-3 times a month) since October and tends to span out 2-3 nights in a row when it does.
Signal	i've been having problems for months now, i can lay down without my phone for hours and i'm not able to sleep until my body just shuts down or something. i've tried everything but it doesn't help, i can spend up to 5-6 hours with my eyes closed and still can't sleep. it's been 30hrs+ without sleep right now, my eyes burn and i still can't sleep i'm so so tired :(
Signal	Sit back this is going to be quite a ride, as this story goes back about 4 months from the period of March 12-18. I’m a 30 year old healthy and previously active male, who’s life has been destroyed by this affliction. I have seen multiple specialists and had many tests and so far there are no answers.So this story starts around March 12, where I came down with an infection that at first seemed like it was mostly cold like symptoms, but quickly progressed to a feverish state. I developed a fever for about 5 days, and during that time I had strange neurological symptoms, such as random saliva production, delirium and strange headaches that started in the back of my head and moved up to the front. After the 5 days of the fever, I felt a shooting pain go up my back and into the back of my head. I was hyperventilating and thought I was going to die, and I was slowly starting to lose consciousness. My dad rushed me to the ER, and I started to see a bright white light before I came to at the ER and was able to walk and talk again. Doctors did cat scans on my head and chest, and the only abnormality found was a right bundle branch on my ECG. I was sent home with 2 mg of Ativan since my heart rate was high, and slept for 8 hours. Fever went away and I thought I had beaten whatever infection I had. Little did I know, that would be the last time I would get real sleep. Hang tight because that’s just the beginning of this story...Alright so for the first month after the incident, I was able to work and exercise and get through the day.. except I noticed one thing... I wasn’t able to sleep properly. I would lay in bed , have a vivid dream and wake up. Then after an hour of tossing and turning , have another vivid dream. This would repeat for 4 times each night but the sleep was not restful at all and no deep sleep was achieved. After about a month, the physical symptoms got worse. I had increasingly bad anxiety and hyper arousal from lack of sleep, my heart rate and blood pressure were both skyrocketing and I was getting night sweats. I took off work in late April after a BP reading of 180/100.. and the next week I had intense pain in random areas of my body.. which culminated in another ER trip, as I was also experiencing heavy breathing episodes and faintness. Since then , I have been out of work after an unsuccessful attempt to return once. I have noticed weight loss and progressive ataxia, and my legs at the moment feel heavy and weak, probably from the progressive effects of the lack of sleep. Some days are worse than others. But in general my condition has been declining. As of last year I was a strong athlete... now I am only able to swim a little in my pool and walk down the block. My body is no longer repairing itself. I’ve had symptoms such as trouble breathing at night, and numbness and tingling in my fingers and arms, that will come on at random times. My hands also have become increasingly shaky, and for the past month, I have mostly been bed-ridden. I have even felt gasping for air at times and waking up feeling oxygen starved, yet at the doctor my oxygen always read 99 percent.. I have been bounced from cardiologist to a heart rhythm specialist for the tachycardia and now to a neurologist who so far thinks it’s anxiety and panic disorder.So far none of the tests done have explained even a fraction of my symptoms. Currently I am in bad shape, I am unable to live a normal life and am on FMLA leave.. I am only out of bed maybe 4-6 hours on a good day to do some walking or swimming at the park for light exercise. I can’t even enjoy my games or TV shows as my concentration has been badly effected. Last night I did have about 4 dreams that were vivid and may have provided a very basic minimal Rest, but just typing this and standing my body is shaky.At this rate of progression I can only see two outcomes. My body gives out and I an basically stuck in bed all day completely, still aware.. or something happens and I die before that. But what I am getting is not sleep, and I have been reading up on fatal insomnia cases and my symptoms have largely matched what is reported. Mind you I am about 4 months into the start of this journey into hell. I told the neurologist what I thought explained my symptoms, and I mentioned that whatever happened after the brain likey infection somehow damaged the part of my brain that regulates sleep and breathing.. but he didn’t take me seriously and told me he sees this all the time and it is anxiety. I have had anxiety issues in my life and anxiety does not explain what I experienced. The only doctor who said it’s not a panic attack and something more was the heart rhythm specialist, who referred me to the neurologist. How bad will it have to get before it’s taken seriously ?I have considered ending it prematurely, but I have many friends and family and do not want to go out a coward, even though every day and night is a living hell and the thought is constantly on my mind. It is literal torture being tired and not able to achieve rest , but I have decided to stay and document everything that happens up until the end... New symptom added, large muscle twitching in my left leg just started after getting up and walking around my condominium. Heart rate is also 120 just walking around.. I ran up stairs yesterday and it shot up to 160. How can the doctors see that there is something very real going on here?
Signal	Once again I cant fall asleep even though I am tired and school just started so I really need sleep and I end up taking Benadryl. I cant do that a 3rd straight night though. What can I do? I know long term better sleep habits better diet etc. But I dont know what i can do to immediately help get sleep now.
NotSignal	It’s about 4:40 am in California and I had some milk tea... which is something I drink when I pull all nighters. 😅 What drink or food keeps you up at night?
NotSignal	One day we gonna wake up in the spirit world to find out that we live in the matrix and our brain will soon have the capability to go over 10%
Signal	I always had trouble falling asleep, would spend 2h maybe 3h until i could finally fall asleep. Then i started taking 3mg melatonin and omg my life changed, i felt like half an hour after laying down i was able to sleep.Now, all of a sudden, i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason whatsoever. I don't drink water or anything 1h before bed and I'm always chilling before bed. Literally, nothing changed in my routine, except that now i wake up after 3h sleeping, around 3am, and then i can't go back to sleep.I'm seeing a doc next tuesday but has anyone ever had this happen to them? Wtf
NotSignal	Having a bit of a bout again. A lot just happened, and dealing with it how I do. Though the posts I see here help. One with reminding me there's ways of getting out of the sleeplessness. Gives you hope you know. Plus i take solice in knowing this is temporary, and I will be stronger because of this. In a sense this is peace. In knowing there is hope.
NotSignal	I've had a sleep disorder since I was young. I'm older now but still have it. It really gets me down to the point I have depression. There's a thing called Sexomnia and sorry for putting this in here but r/sexomnia has not been active for ages.Does anyone else grope in their sleep? I have did this with ex girlfriend's, friends of mine and random people at party's. My doctor is really helpful and offering amazing solutions and that includes a sleep apnea clinic...Anyone else do this? He said it's more common than we think.
Signal	Hi everyone, I used to take 1 mg of melatonin every night, but over a course of a year, the melatonin would stop working, and I'd lie awake into the night again. So, I decided to take a break from it, and I haven't taken melatonin in like 4 months, but I'm thinking of starting to take it again, since I can't fall asleep properly anymore. (If I get in bed at 10, I'd fall asleep around 4am.) This is especially important to me now, as summer is over and school is in swing again.But this time I bought a pill-cutter, so the dose I'd be taking nightly is 0.5 mg. Is that enough to cause me to build up a tolerance again? What is the proper dose of melatonin to not build up a tolerance?Also, are there any adverse side-effects of long-term daily usage of melatonin? I can't find any on the web, but i don't trust my own judgements lol.
NotSignal	Is there a slow release or controlled release version of Doxylamine Succinate available out there? I can not find one with google searching. I know some melatonin capsules are slow release to supposedly help keep you asleep, but they do not work for me. Doxylamine Succinate works wonderfully for me and I have no trouble falling asleep. My problem is every night waking up AT LEAST once, often more, and often seem to not get REM sleep. Is there a version that can continuously release the Doxylamine throughout the night to hopefully keep me asleep? Thanks in advance.
NotSignal	I explain. If I manage to create a healthy sleeping schedule by going to bed at the same hour and waking up early, only one night of insomnia will ruin it entirely and I'll need month to regulate it again (especially when you don't have a job or studies that require leaving the house).But, this new bad cycle where I sleep during the day for some magical reason won't shift back to the original. Even if I push myself to stay awake and end up collapsing in the afternoon, I'll end up waking up at the same time. My body seems to prefer having only 3 hours of sleep than to sleep at night.Is there an explanation to that ?
NotSignal	I’m staying with my family for a bit. I usually slept with the A/C off at my apartment, but it’s on at my family’s. I don’t necessarily mind the temperature, but the constant feeling of the air moving has been keeping me up. It feels so weird on my face, almost like I’m submerged in moving water.
NotSignal	Who of you has / had chronic insomnia, and who has beaten it without any sleeping drugs? Free for sale herbal things would be fine, but it seems like my routine is completely off since 2 months now and i wonder if there is a secret tip lmao&#x200B;If you read it all : Hope you fall asleep easily today =)
NotSignal	I‘ve been trying to figure out the reason behind my insomnia for months now and I just had a realization.I started a healthy diet last October because I wanted to lose weight and clean up my bad eating habits. I used to eat a ton of meat, which I didn’t realize was bad until I learned about nutrition. Half of my plate would be filled with meat. So, I significantly lessened the amount of meat I consumed by following the plate method.It is also important to note that I’m allergic to all kinds of seafood, except for maybe seaweed. I can’t eat fish or shellfish, which are major sources of omega-3 fatty acids. I did some research and found that an omega-3 deficiency can cause sleeping problems by interfering with the production of melatonin. Meat apparently has a small amount of omega-3 fatty acids, which maybe was enough for me before I started dieting. But, after I cut back my meat, I fear that I may not be meeting my daily omega-3 fatty acid target amount.I’m actually working to desensitize myself to seafood. I try to eat a tablespoon a day. I am also trying to eat other non-seafood sources of omega-3s like chia seeds. However, I still don’t think it’s enough.I never really understood my insomnia because I do not have depression or anxiety. I do occasionally stress but it never bothered my sleep before. I’ve tried almost every tip out there. I also suspect that it could be a GABA deficiency due to my lower protein consumption although this is less likely.Does anyone have a similar problem?
NotSignal	I was really scared because i thought there would be side effects or that i’d feel myself let go but now for some reason i am stressed because i don’t feel any side effects? I can’t seem to be tired/sleepy or if I am, it’s only for a small amount of time before it fades... I’m exercising, i’ve never been lazy and laying on the couch... I really don’t want to go through a third sleepless night haha
NotSignal	I find this really weird and wonder how many can relate to this but my whole life I have struggled to sleep; unless I have company. This depends entirely on the company of course but if I’m with a friend/lover I find I can fall asleep as anyone with regular sleep would. I remember struggling with sleep since a very young age, I think I needed my mum to tuck me in until I was about 7, they would read to me, sing to me, pray with me, play me music, anything to get me to sleep peacefully until my parents eventually got sick of it. I remember always listening to rainforest music and NEEDING it otherwise I would lay awake for ages until my mind literally couldn’t be awake any further and it’s been that way forever. As I got older I had a tv in my room so I can say all the lines to about 10 movies because I’d put them on to sleep. Later it was music that I needed and nothing else would do. I Read for hours at night and even that wouldn’t let my brain rest (now it does).As a teenager I found it became worse, and tbh I’d say this is because of anxiety/depression and in general from a typical teenager lifestyle. But my whole teenage life I would say on average I would have had 5 hours sleep. I’d take 1-2 hours to fall asleep and staying asleep was/IS even harder. Some of those hours laying awake have been the hardest hours of my life, I’ve always felt loneliness and at night is when weighs in more heavily.Anyway, in my late teens I was basically couch surfing and I would stay with my best friend a lot of the time and sleep in his bed and I can’t tell you how much of a relief it was to realise I can actually get a night of rest if I have someone by my side. I’ve noticed after dating a few people, on the nights I’m away from them my insomnia symptoms flare, takes ages to get there, can’t stay asleep for long and then struggle to get back to sleep but sometimes I get a full 8 hours. For a year now I’ve been smoking weed every day so this obviously has had many cause and effect results and I have trauma to add to it as something happened while I slept and recently I went through a relationship breakdown which really has reiterated my perception of my insomnia and the fact it helps me when someone is there. It’s 5:30am for me, went to sleep at 12 and woke up 4 hours later! This is after a day of work, some emotional turmoil, a sesh at the gym and multiple cones. Really I just wonder if I can get advice on helping treat insomnia and if anyone can relate to the fact I sleep when I have good company; it’s more just annoying to me at this stage in my life because I’m 22 and I’d like to function regularly and avoid forming that kind of dependency in a relationship...
NotSignal	Anything less than 60mg of Melotonin does not really affect me.Is this normally for a person who has insomnia. Sometime I even have to add an anti-histamine too.Maybe this is because I dont have good gut absorption, but it still seems high for me.Any comments?
Signal	I always wake up after 5 hrs of sleep, the best i done was 6. Then i either manage to fall asleep and sleep 2 more hrs or i just keep waking up every 20 minutes and its horrible. I m like this for a year and a half already. I can only pinpoint the huge stress i got at some period of time which triggered this. Lets just say i dont feel depressed like that anymore but i have kept the sleeping issues. Even if i take benzos, still the same story
NotSignal	Hi, I have some forms of chronic pain that are giving me issues when trying to sleep, so my parents are thinking of trying to give me sominex. Just wondered what peoples experiences with it are and if it helped them in the slightest. I am on other medicines too so if you know of any reactions with them that'd be useful too. TIA
NotSignal	My sleeping pattern is fucked. But normaly when i dindt sleep the night i fell easy asleep the next day. But now it has been 36 hours and i stil cant sleep. Anny tips ?(Sorry for bad english)
NotSignal	Hi all, Whenever I've been trying to sleep over the last two months, I keep noticing that I'm drifting off when trying to sleep and this suddenly wakes me up again. Then I find myself realizing that Im not asleep and then get anxious about it. This cycle leads me to getting around 2-3hrs of sleep a night. Has anyone got any tips to distract my mind to drift off? I've tried boring podcasts, audiobooks, along with guided meditation and various breathing techniques, I get drowsy and start to fall asleep using these tools but then my mind notices I'm drifting off again and I'm awake.
NotSignal	Right now I've been falling asleep okay around 5 AM, waking up after one sleep cycle, and then being up for a few more hours tossing and turning before falling back to sleep. Then I'll get another couple sleep cycles in.I'm going to try going to sleep at 10 PM instead of 5 AM like I've been doing, and see if that helps at all. Does anyone with any knowledge of sleep hygiene know the best way to go about this? I've been up all night so I'll be able to crash at 10 I think. But for the next few days, should I get up immediately once I feel that my sleep is broken, and just deal with the grogginess that follows to try to break my body of the habit of splitting sleep cycles up like it's been doing, or is it a better idea to just set my alarm for 8-10 hours after going to sleep, accepting whatever broken sleep occurs during that time, and accepting that I may just have to deal with waking up before the sleep cycle is complete (and feel groggy and messed up)? I'm not sure which would be better to encourage sleeping all the way through the night, and also in the past I've been able to say fall asleep at 10 on the sleep-deprived day, but then can't fall asleep until 5 AM like normal the following day, so the sleep schedule stays messed up.Well I hope someone can help me out, I think most people with insomnia can't really pin down what is going on, but I don't really know what to do except ask the internet.
NotSignal	Been trying to wake up 7am everyday no matter what, as it's been a general consensus to be helpful.i've been doing it for probably 3 months now.I still always end up sleeping late though, and mornings are incredibly frustrating. i'm only getting 3-4 hours sleep daily during this week.My body clock has been slowly drifting later and later, even though i keep wake up time the same.This whole week, I felt tired and weak everyday so i'm barely able to do tasks. And fighting to get up every morning when you've had 3 hours sleep is so painful.Everyday feels torture. It's so hard.
Signal	More of a rant, sorry if it doesnt fit here, dont have anything better to do while I wait for the fucking night to pass and very frustrated with having to deal with this shit.I hate nights and I hate sleeping. Its always an effort to fall asleep and every night where i fall asleep by 4 am feels like I failed doing what my body was supposed to do and just fucking sleep. Ive tried everything. Melatonin supplements, non-prescription sleeping supplements, even this weird-ass spray thats supposed to make it easier to sleep, exercise. It just made me physically tired, but I still cant fucking sleep. I never find a confortable position, Im always thirsty or need to take a piss, I try to sleep with the window closed, it gets hot as hell, i try to sleep with it open, i get a sore throat in the morning. Half the time my head is pounding. Right now, i cant even lay down without my head pounding like a damn drum. My mom offered to give me some of her prescription sleeping pills, but I dont want to take them without having them prescribed to me first. My mom is also quite in disagreement with me seeing a doctor and I have no ideea why. Im just done with spending the night again hoping that Ill finally be able to sleep before 4 am. I just want to be able to sleep well and function like a normal human the next day..
NotSignal	Hi guys.....I'm new to this forum so may I just put a question to you. I'm not the greatest sleeper in the world, but I've just learnt to live with it and not beat myself up. However what is the science of thought behind waking early, (for me around 4am) trying to get back to sleep and for some strange reason eventually nodding off again around 6am, waking a couple of hours later. I did read about it somewhere but can't remember what it said. Any thoughts gratefully welcome, thanks.
Signal	It's so annoying. I'll just lay here on my phone till my roommate leaves for work in the early morning. I don't want to wake them up early but I also just don't want to be annoyed that I'm annoyed about not being able to sleep...
Signal	I’m curious, are antidepressants effective for the treatment of insomnia? Doctor says the insomnia is caused by anxiety, but we’re not sure antidepressants will fix her problem. She’s afraid she may have to rely on meds to go to sleep for the rest of her life. At some point, meds lose their effectiveness and will no longer work for sleep. What will she do then?
NotSignal	sometimes when i go for like more than 2 days without sleep i get really strong heartbeating that i can feel and hear in my chest but only when i lie down and try to sleep. does anyone experienced the same thing?
NotSignal	This guy is incredible at putting me to sleep, it's I honestly one of the only things that's ever helped me with sleep and sleep related anxiety when I don't have meds. [Michael sealey ](https://youtu.be/_xzjWPSPTq8) is an amazing sleep hypnosis therapist, he uses a rhythmic pattern and monotone voice and it works insanely well. I don't think I've stated awake through a video more than a handful of times
NotSignal	Maybe it will calm us down after reading about sleep deprivation. On a side note: it can be funny seeing someone rising to the task and challenge and beat that record
NotSignal	Hey guys, wanted to share my problem with you. Maybe someone here may give me some good advice. I’d be really grateful.I’m male, 23 y.o., doing my master’s degree and working at a law firm. Approximately since I was 17 I started experiencing irrational fear of death when I did not get enough sleep. It was rather mild back then. I still have this condition. It gets much worse when I do not sleep enough, drink coffee and stress outWhen I go to bed I sometimes just feel like I’m having a heart attack. My muscles start to contract, I may feel mild pain in my chest, I start breathing “manually” and I feel like the next second will be the second when my heart stops. I can not sleep after that. I often feel the same in the office, at the university, etc. I think I learned to live with it - I usually try to ignore the fear and convince myself that I’m not dying until until it is gone. I also learned that coffee is one of the main triggers. The problem is that I have hypotonia - without coffee I just really difficult for me to focus. So it feels like a vicious cycle - I can not study, work or communicate with people without coffee, but with it I can not sleep and become anxious. After a night of bad sleep I consume more caffeine to get through the day, and by the end of it I’m again too anxious to sleep - even more.I visited a cardiologist multiple times in order to figure out if something is wrong with my heart, but I was always told that my heart is healthy. My primary care physician told me it is just vegetative-vascular dystonia and I should not worry about it.That kinda gives me hope that I’m not going to die from this, however, it really affects my life significantly. I do not feel healthy and I’m regularly scared. I wonder if there is any right way to approach this problem. Like - what doctor should I visit with this? Can I solve it myself, without actually seeing a doctor? Is it a psychological or a physiological issue?Thank you.
NotSignal	Falling asleep isn’t much of challenge for me so long as it’s not at night, in my bed, at home, when I need, or before/during something important. I can fall asleep on the phone, literally the instant I sit down in a car, at my friends house, working on important stuff, on the toilet, and even leaning against a wall (I usually fall down when that happens though). But the second I lay down in my bed at night my brain says “hey fuckface what are you doing you’re not tired” even though I’ve been drowsy and fatigued and exhausted all day. All I wanna do is sleep at night and be awake during the day but even that’s too much to fucking ask from whatever douchebag deity or cosmic force that or whatever that has my entire life an uphill battle on the slopes of shit mountain!
NotSignal	As a young parent, I sometimes had a hard time to sleep and to catch up with sleep. Because often, our baby daughter was crying & restless. But several months ago, [I created a playlist to help her fall asleep faster](https://play.soundsgood.co/playlist/smartlink/relaxing-sleep-music-for-babies-children-and-sleepy-parents) & deeper. And it works!It works for me, too - this music collection helps me to unwind just before going to bed. So why wouldn't it help you? Worth a try, no?
Signal	To start off I am 17 years old and for the past few months it has been near impossible to fall asleep. I’ll lay in bed for countless hours with a blank mind with my eyes closed but nothing happens. In the off chance that I do end up sleeping it will be for 8-12 hours. I’m not sure what to do at this point to help falling asleep. Sorry if i’m not posing this in the right subreddit but I don’t know were else it could go.
NotSignal	If i try to go to bed at standard times i will toss and turn for hours until i see the first rays of sunlight. However i can easily nap and sleep almost anytime in the day even night - but before 12am. And if i do sleep before midnight, my body will take it as a nap and i will wake up in 1-2hours’ time. Just last night i slept at 11pm only to wake up at 1am. I havent slept since and its 11am now. It seems if i try to sleep anytime before midnight my body will take it as a nap. Have tried to stay awake a full day to reset my body clock to no avail. Honestly makes me hate sleeping time
Signal	thankfully, i actually fall asleep after a while unlike before where i just laid awake for hours until dawn. But i would like to fix this since i end up waking up in the afternoon. Whats something u use to fall asleep quicker? ( im taking melatonin every other night)
Signal	I've had insomnia for a very long time, at least 8 years, at one point I didn't even feel awake anymore, everything just kinda felt hazy and dreamlike. Then about 8 or 9 months ago I started to sleep better not normal, mind you, but i could get 5 or 6 hours a night and it was amazing. Being able to sleep better and be more awake made me less numb to my feelings and also made me realize how much i was missing, it also made me realize several things about myself. But for the last couple months the insomnia has been coming back, and I just don't understand how I lived like this before, I mean, being aware that I'm miserable is better than not being aware of anything. Because at least i can feel fleeting moments of happiness now.
Signal	Ive never found it easy to sleep but now it just sucks. Even when im physically exhausted i cant just sleep. Its not as hard falling asleep as it it staying asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and then just lay there for hours trying to fall back asleep. Im pretty much only able to sleep like 4 hours at a time. I think itll eventually get better when im not going through this withdrawal but if yall have any tips for me they'd help
Signal	I don’t have to go on about how much difficulty I have getting to sleep, staying asleep and waking refreshed. No OTC drug works. Lifestyle and sleep hygiene def don’t help. Only Clonazepam works, and works well! Well my doctor wants me to try Belsorma, selective, dual orexin receptor antagonist. Anyone have experience with it?
Signal	Its the millionth day of this bs I close my eyes Shapes and colors form abstractly behind my eyelids My mind rambles through the rumbles of the day New scenes replace the shapes. Places I've been Places I think about Would dream about If even in this abstract state I don't dream Underneath the images and the random thoughts tossed about my mind I lie completely awake 8 hoursWishing Hoping Begging for sleep Completely awake. Unable to shake off the brightness Of my alert state Unable to shake off the awareness of everything around me Why can't I loose my self in the dream? Why can't I dream? It seems This is the routine Phones off Lights out Fan on But I stir and I fumble and I toss and I turn It's 11 am now Feels good to have to work at five Barely aware, barely alive My body is tired, my brain is hot For days in a row giving all I've got My body aches and my mind it rots What is it like to really dream?
NotSignal	I’m new to this sub and my sleep problems started around last month.i was in my bed last night, it was about midnight and I was just screwing around on my phone, I’m on my phone for a little and I look at my clock again and it’s 4am. I was genuinely confused if I had slept and got back on my phone because I don’t think I was really just sitting in my bed for THAT long.
NotSignal	have any of you had this side effect? I am being treated with colchicine low does 0,5mg for about 1,5 month after "supposedly" pericarditis, I say supposedly because ECG was clean, and chest rx was clean, but my inflamatory markers were high and it was pleuritic pain in the chest that got worse laying down
NotSignal	Right it’s 5:00am and I DIDNT FUCKING SLEEP THE INTIRE GODDAMN NIGHT. And guys the worst is that I’m still not tired at all. What the fuck Is wrong with me ??!
NotSignal	for anyone have insomnia do u even know why do u have it? anyone know what causes insomnia ? like is there something wrong with out brains?
NotSignal	So here's what happens, I can sleep from like 9-2 sometimes then 4-30-730.I dont want to take more sick days. Instead of laying in bed for almost 3 hours, what if I got up, worked out, and showered and then went back to sleep
NotSignal	During the day I feel like I could literally fall asleep leaning against a wall.. But when it comes time to actually sleep at home I suddenly get wide awake? Like as soon as my head hits the pillow I want to get up..? Does anyone else experience this?
NotSignal	I notice faint auditory hallucinations when i try to sleep and it's always someone calling my name, does anyone have tips to help relax or ease auditory hallucinations ? It's the only thing that really bothers me
NotSignal	We moved to a new house about 3 months ago. The house is located in a newly developed area and there are less houses nearby. But it is in the city. Somehow, I find it hard to sleep in here, especially on the first floor. But when I go elsewhere, I don't have trouble sleeping. What can I do to improve my situation? Thanks!
Signal	I literally cannot feel anything on Ambien besides maybe a little drowsy? Trazodone knocks me out almost instantly and I fall asleep within 30 minutesI’ve been getting 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep for the past two nights and I feel so much relief
NotSignal	And I'm not in withdrawls, I'm literally 3am waker if I get too sleep or otherwise I'm up all night like tonight, this is just a vent as I know theres nothing that can be done.Just heard them fucking seagulls
NotSignal	I've been lurking on the r/insomnia and r/IndieAuthors subreddits for a few years now (as I fit both of those demographics) and I seem to be seeing a (somewhat) repeating theme in various thread comments where people with insomnia just use that chronic awakeness to write novels/short stories/etc. As a fellow sufferer and writer, would anyone here be interested in forming a kind of indie publishing group by which people with insomnia can get together, bounce ideas off each other, find similarly afflicted beta readers, network to find the best independent cover artists/editors/etc. and maybe find something new to do while we watch the sun come up? (If this gets enough traction, I'm sure I could plan out some kind of website/social media presence. also, I'm planning to crosspost to r/indieauthors if I build up enough karma to do so; this isn't my main account)
NotSignal	I don't really know if this fits this sub but anyway.I have been on dialysis for about 2 years and it has gotten worse with time. Maybe I should add that I go 3 days a week now. At first there was the headache keeping me awake for hours but recently it got better so i thought i could finally live without much complications. But tgen i noticed that if i lie down for a like 15 mins my breathing gets really hard and uncomfortable when i mentioned it to the doctors they told me i had water in my lungs. Now they have to take more water out of my body during the procedure. It helps for like one day but every other day there just is too much water in my lungs and this makes it nearly impossible too sleep. So i just want to say breathe that air as long as you still can. And for those of you who didn't already consider taking cbd maybe give it a shot. In high percentages it really helps me
NotSignal	(This post isn't for people who have tried both of these and hasn't worked)I have had chronic insomnia for almost 3 years(Don't believe me? Check the first post I ever made on reddit) , and it's been hellish. Almost night seemed to be a game of wack a mole, with my sleep issues ranging from either sleep onset or sleep maintaince. One thing was consistent, I couldn't sleep for more than 6 hours. Around March 31, I decided to finally start self administering ACT(acceptance based therapy) and finally try to get on the path of recovery, after quarantine started. It was extremely difficult at first, as it seemed my insomnia seemed to be getting more aggressive, having my first completely sleepless night in more than 2 years, and for about a month and a half, it seemed like being on the program was making me sleep worse. About 2 weeks ago, something amazing happened, I started getting 7 hours of sleep consistently, and started sleeping through the night without much hiccup, and going to bed much earlier, without any drugs. This does work y'all!!! If you have chronic insomnia, the potential reward outweighs the risk by a lot!!! It is difficult, but I guarantee you that struggling with insonmia for the forthcoming future is even more difficult. If you dislike the sleep restriction, ACT doesn't require sleep restriction. I was a skeptic myself, questioning if it was psychological issue. However, the reality is that if you have had it for more than 3 months, the most likely thing that your brain has probably learned to start waking you up in the night, struggle to fall asleep. The worst case scenario is that you are going to be exactly how you are like now, and the best case is that you finally get to sleep again. Price isn't a issue because nowadays you can get books teaching you how to self administer both ot the programs for free, or at most 8 dollars(what I paid for how to the sleep book). Truly, you have no reason to do it.If you are wondering what ACT is, it's just like CBT however without the sleep restriction, and instead works on mindfulness and acceptance. It sounded weird to me but look where I am now. If you need a recommendation on how to administer it, look at the sleep book and sleep school, they work best in tandem of each other, but they work separately as well.Good luck
Signal	Currently it is 4am. I tried going to bed at 10:30pm and stayed wide awake the whole time. It feels like for me every other day I sleep well, generally 6+ hours, and then the other days I get little to no hours of sleep what so ever. I think the reason is because I think too much. Like, that’s it. I try not to, but like thoughts just race through my head as I’m trying to sleep, and it seems like nothing can stop it. For example, if I read a comic or watch a tv show, and Im like attached to it, I would just be thinking that the whole time as I’m trying to sleep. I gotten used to doing that because when I was younger, me thinking about stories and stuff like that actually helped me go to sleep. But not anymore now that I’m older. And sometimes I’m so tired and exhausted but I just can’t sleep and it frustrates me. Does anyone have any good advise on how to maintain thoughts?
Signal	Since the lockdown, my sleep has been terrible. Weird thing is, I've been working from home for over a year now and basically nothing has changed for me. I don't go out on walks as much, but I usually went after nightfall anyway. I don't feel anxious, I just can't sleep. I usually fall asleep to the chatter of thoughts and images of future projects, but these suddenly seem to energise me and I struggle to stay still.I've always had a bit of a problem with sleep. Or rather, with keeping a regular sleep schedule. Were it up to me, I'd run 30 hour days instead of 24 no problem. I'm also an avid hiker and often camp in nature free of screens and artificial light. Even after three weeks in nature I remain essentially nocturnal (weirdly with an hour of wakefulness at dawn, perfect time to collect and cut some firewood, wash up and then go on to sleep until past noon)It was going down and then I broke it completely. I tried to imitate the aforementioned hiking biphasic schedule, thinking it appears natural and might fix some other problems I was having (essentially my brain doesn't come online before noon no matter when I get up and how long I've been doing so. It has been like this for years. It's nothing but lost time to me). I did it once. Once I set my alarm clock at 4am with the intention of going back to sleep an hour or two later, spending the time doing stuff etc. I can't fall asleep before 6 ever since, that's two weeks. I'm getting anywhere between 4 to 6 hours of sleep (partner wakes me up, I could happily sleep all day) when normally I need a bit over 9. It's getting to me.How do I fix this?
NotSignal	Hello everyone! We are a small team of enthusiasts. We want to help people sleep better.I have some issues with sleep and anxiety in general so for me it's personal. To make the app properly I need to speak with you - real people with real sleep problems. We can do it through direct for example.
Signal	Hello! Within the span of 30 days straight, I’ve had insomnia every single fckin day. It started off with only 6 hours of sleep after which I wasn’t able to fall asleep once again. I didn’t feel sleepy nor tired. But I did feel irritated. Then the thing split. I had only 3 hours of sleep straight after which all attempts to slip into the arm of Morpheus were to no avail. Though, occasionally I managed to do that, but still woke up after another portion of 3-hour sleep. Cycle. Then my doc advised me on phenibut, so I could manage my anxiety issues and cease to have disrupted sleep therefore. And you know what? It all split once again. As of now, I manage to have like 1,5 hours of sleep after which my brain goes out of what’s considered to be a sleep state. Though I have to confess it’s easier to fall asleep now, I’m still getting even more nervous and irritated. Wtf is going on with my sleep patterns? I don’t feel that much tired during the day. But I do feel that I’m not getting enough sleep. My sleep is sufficient to function at least somehow during the day without the need to take a nap (though I do that occasionally).I’m 19 y.o and this sleep problem is ruining my mental health and my life even more than I do myself. I’m from the country in which it’s beyond the possible to find a normal doc specializing in sleep disorders and stuff like that. As you might’ve noticed - I was advised to take phenibut to deal with it all, lol. Plus, after searching for a while, I can’t even find an adequate place in which I could potentially get sleep study. So, what should I do to stop this detrimental-to-my-mental-health thing? Any idea? Or am I doomed? Sorry for my English (not my first). If something wasn’t clear enough - I can clarify! Thank you for reading this opus.
Signal	I realized I had 4 different nights where I didn’t sleep it all. Prior to Covid, I’ve had sleep issues since childhood (including lots of insomnia during high school/college) but this is the most trouble I’ve had falling asleep in adulthood. Like, comparatively, I between 22-34, I may have only had 5 or 6 sleepless nights total. Lots of other nights where I don’t fall asleep until 1 or 2. I get up at 6am every day.
Signal	Im sooo done, when going to sleep 11 pm i toss and turn till i get stressed up and then i woukd fall asleep at 6 am or something dor 2-3 hours, when im lucky i go to bed later around 1 or 2 am and get 3-4 more hours of sleep, but its making me really tired troughout the day nowadays... I got Remeron prescribed 7 5mg, but i dont consider it an option because i dont want to take sleepint meds, other than natural ones. Hope u slept well if you read this
NotSignal	Remeron is an anti-depressant, off label use anti-histamine. I've realized its the anti-histamine effect that lets me sleep, but the side effects of the drug are making it not worth it.... terrible "hang over effect", restless legs (which ironically keep me awake), and insatiable appetite...I feel an OTC anti-histamine might be worth a try, but one that isn't overly strong as remeron
Signal	Why do irrational fears of sleep exist? Why does my brain refuse to stop doing things when I want to sleep? Why couldn’t sleep be something done automatically like breathing? Whose ideas was it to make living creatures have to sleep? Do beings in other words sleep? Are there even other creatures in other worlds? *looks at clock* why is it 3:30am when 5 minutes ago it was 12:00am? Summary of how my brain likes to contemplate life when it should be sleeping. Ugh. Feels like an alnighter night. Hopefully you all can sleep.
Signal	Hello. This is my first post on reddit, just hoping to get some tips or helpful info. For the past 3 months probably I’ve been going to sleep anywhere from 4am-7am. Usually I’ll lay in bed for 3 or more hours trying to fall asleep but unable to. I haven’t gone to sleep for the past two nights and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried a few different things like melatonin, Benadryl, and clonidine. It’s like I need to catch up on sleep and each day it gets worse and worse. I don’t know if it makes much sense but even though I haven’t slept for the past 2 days I still don’t have that tired feeling. Anyone have any ideas other than prescription meds?
NotSignal	People say if you can't sleep after 20 minutes get out of bed and do something like read or watch TV, right?Well what happens if your eyes are burning you're that tired, you are completely exhausted so you can't even read or watch TV.You can't sleep either, wtf is going on.
Signal	Oh look it's almost 4am and my alarm is in 3 hours and 30 mins, and I have not slept yet. Now I'm going to have trouble sleeping more as I know it's only a matter of time before the call to duty. Anyone else get alarm anxiety, and what are some of the things you do to try combat it?
Signal	Another night of no sleep... i can only get decent sleep when i use a benzodiazepine. How bad would it be to just rely on those pills? Not sleeping at all is certainly is more detrimental to your health right?
NotSignal	Has anyone experienced twitching and/or muscle spams that worsen at night? Its been a contributing factor to my insomnia, and has been a major stressor for me
NotSignal	I fell asleep shortly before one extremely tired and thought "hey, if I'm this tired, maybe I'll sleep the entire night" boy was I wrong. I woke up wide awake and ready for the day at 3:45. FML
Signal	Just had to make the decision again. Few nights of terrible quality sleep, I felt like I was going to fall over when out and about. Pain decides to flare up again. And, I had to choose not having pain over sleep, as my pain meds, rather than making me drowsy, make my insomnia worse. I feel like the universe is just playing a huge joke on me to be honest. Not sure when I started taking it so personally. Grow up with depression/anxiety (basically have personality disorder), have insomnia since 16. Wait about 10 years before deciding it was okay to get help; no meds work for me. Tell psych I cannot possibly bear anymore emotional pain and I am getting desperate; get slapped with a genetic condition and the chronic pain that comes with it. Something else for me to cope with. Get given prophylactic pain meds, so I won't feel as much pain; allergic to them. Get given pain meds as reactive treatment; gives me insomnia. One. Big. Joke.End rant.
Signal	I’m trying to create a sleep schedule (which is hard with my job but whatever). So I went to bed at 10:45, which is my earliest in quite a while, woke up at 12:30 to go to the toilet and now I can’t get back to sleep. I went on my phone for a total of like 2 mins the 2nd time I went to the toilet and that was like an hr ago. It’s been nearly 2 hrs since I woke up. I have to take melatonin every night to put me asleep and I’m not sure how much I’m able to take, so I probably shouldn’t take more. Legit just tossing and turning. Haven’t had a good sleep in a while because my work fucked my sleep up again last week. Ik I shouldn’t be on my phone rn but just laying here isn’t going anything so.
Signal	After weeks of decent sleep it's time for shitty sleep. For a few days I have been waking up regularly at around 4:00 and thoughts come rushing into my mind, just stupid unhelpful thoughts and I don't have the energy to make them stop. It takes around 3 hours to fall asleep again...
NotSignal	I was a heavy cannabis smoker and I recently stopped for jobs and productivity. But not I haven't slept in days and I'm wondering if anyone has expirenced this or how long it last!?
Signal	disclaimer: just venting. please don't give unsolicited advice so i take 300mg of gabapentin to help me stay asleep as thats a bigger problem than me getting to sleep. i have trazodone for like emergencies but dont take it daily anymore bc i started building a tolerance. might be trying extended release melatonin soonanyway, today (i guess yesterday) has been super rough. just exhausted as all get out, had therapy today, and ex roommate dropped by unexpectedly which really took all the spoons i had left for the day. i took my gabapentin around 8 or 9pm bc i was actually close to falling asleep at a decent time. im supposed to take it a few hrs before i go to sleep to help prevent "hangovers" the following day. i think i finally fell asleep around 10:30 or so. i was REALLY hoping i could get a solid 8 hrs *at least* maybe wake up at a decent time & enjoy my morning. but nope! i woke up at 2am & couldnt go back asleep. its now almost 7am & im finally getting tired again but the thing is i have to be up by 11:30am to get ready for work.i guess i shouldve taken my trazodone as well to help knock me out harder
Signal	I've had insomnia since I can remember as a child. I sleep every other day or sometimes 2-3 hours a night. If I do get a long sleep, I usually wake up every so often. When I sleep I always get sleep paralysis and/or lucid dream so I'm still exhausted after a nights sleep even though I supposedly slept. My partner suggested I should try doing a sleep study and Im not sure how to even go about that or if it will actually help.
NotSignal	I have work tomorrow and I haven't slept in two days. I can't find my prescription. Someone please kill me.
Signal	Have access to both medical and other. I want Low-None TCH. something as an alternative to Ambient or Xanax?Is CBD the best for this?What are the best brands/types for sleep/anxiety/relaxation? I know Indica but sometimes they have high TCH too. As I said I am looking for any help. thanks
Signal	I havent had insomnia for ages. I just Started a job. Going to Sleep earlier step by step to get used to the job. I was having some anxiety thoughts popping up here and there about sleep but I succesfully managed to fall asleep since I was so tired thanks to the job. Suddenly out of no fucking where I wake up at 2 am after sleeping for less than one and a half hour. I have no fucking idea whats going on but the windows are vibrating there is like weird drilling, humming engine sound as if a low pitched jet plane was starting its engines next to my head. People are shoutijg on the street and whistling and the engine sound is getting stronger and my whole room is vibrating.The only thing I saw when I looked out was a yellow light at the end of the street but nothing else And hearing (construction men???) shouting. This has been goIng on for half an hour and I hear people Throwing around heavy metal things.i have no idea how the fuck this is legal or what even was this I luckily never experienced this before in my entire lif but now Im stressing the fuck out its 2:30 am my adrenaline and anger makes it unable to sleep while I feel like shit thanks to tiredness and Im supposed to wake up at 6:30 am. How the fuck will I put up with this? My sleep anxiety is kicking in. I still hear them from the distance altough its now not thst loud and Im afraid they will xome back again.
NotSignal	Not sure if I was vivid dreaming but woke up at 3 am with a dream of a tv show I watched and then slept again and woke up at 7am with a dream of me going into shopping somewhere. My question is that is vivid dream mean anything bad or everybody gets it?
Signal	I've had sleep issues for YEARS, I can garuntee it's after they screwed me up because of meds when I was little.Sometimes I sleep fine, sometimes I get maybe 30 minutes a day, normally I get around 3hours if I'm lucky. Every so often a friend will go to sleep with me on the phone and I get into the habit of relying on them to be there.My one friend who hasn't screamed at me over it yet, hasn't talked to me in 3 days because his brother is a controlling bitch and wants all his attention, it's hard to explain. I haven't slept even 2 full hours in 3 days because I don't have him. I can't stand the feeling of being alone, I hate it, it scares me. I'm too reliant on having someone to fall asleep with and I hate it because I just can't sleep when they're busy.When I got out of bed this morning (about 15-30 minutes of sleep) I was so sick. Idk if it's related at all but I could hardly hear, I couldn't move or stand without being so dizzy I had go rely on walls and objects to keep me up, I was so nauseous as well. All I know is that sucked and I don't want it to happen again.Thanks for listening, my mom doesn't believe I have any issues because when I do sleep I sleep in the daytime when she's at work.
NotSignal	i’m so tired of laying in bed at 11pm and just fucking closing my eyes and still not be able to fall asleep. I just want to go to sleep, please. It’s now 4:37 am and I’ve been in my bed for a good 5-6 hours now and I still can’t sleep.do u guys know anything that could help me with my insomnia
Signal	Most nights I have actual stomach aches due to trying to fall asleep and the anxiety tied to it because it’s so hard for me. It doesn’t help that I suffer from emetaphobia (the phobia of vomiting) so it keeps me up later and makes me even more stressed. Has anyone experienced stomach aches trying to sleep? Did anything to help?
NotSignal	Does anyone else have insomnia caused by orgasm? (Female, if it matters.) I’ve googled in the past and only find articles about how orgasm helps people fall asleep and only one mention buried many pages in how perhaps adrenaline can cause sleeplessness for some after orgasming. Never seems to fail that if I climax (alone or with a partner), I’m in for a sleepless night—no matter how exhausted or sleepy I feel. Would love to find a cure that doesn’t require abstinence.
Signal	Does anyone have experience with Temazepam? I started with Xanax to help me sleep and it works great, but I get weary using it more than 1x a week. Psychiatrist gave me Trazodone to try and it was horrible. I will never try it again. I got the worst sleep ever on it. Today he gave me something called Temazepam. He said it works similarly to Xanax,but lasts longer and people do not develop a tolerance to it. The only thing he said I needed to be mindful of is the fact that it takes longer to kick in. Xanax will kick in in about 20-40 mins depending on the dose I take. He said this takes about 1-2hrs.
Signal	I try and do everything to make my sleeping conditions good but something always fucks up.I wake up in the middle of the night needing to urinate, then once I fix that problem the problem of house being too noisy arises. Then another and another another, but last was the biggest load of bullshit yet ,turns out there's a fucking wild animal running about in my attic, and when I say running around I mean this thing is doing fucking Usain Bolt sprints back and forth to the point where it feels like the roof is going to fall on me,everytime I felt like I was going to fall asleep it woke me up FML!!!
NotSignal	I've had one leg that is tight and cramped now for about a week. Now my other leg is starting to cramp up, I'm starting to get scared this isnt a normal symptom. Anyone else get severe leg cramps that wont go away?
NotSignal	I mean like when I fall asleep Im still a light sleeper but luckly I usually dont wake up during the night. (more like day these days amirite...) But because I had a really hard time falling asleep a while ago ever since I have felt like Im incapable of falling asleep and now even if im really tired and i havent slept all day I cant get my self to just go to bed bc if I try I will end up staying awake all night . These days i just have to wait until I just pass out in the morning..
NotSignal	I've had trouble sleeping my whole life but in the last 2 years or so I've been completely plagued with nightmares. I have at least one every night, often multiple in the same night, with no recurring themes or anything, just general bad dreams of varying levels of scariness. They cause me to wake up and I have trouble getting back to sleep because of them since often times they're so vivid I can't decipher if it was a dream of reality. A few of my colleagues in work take CBD oil for a restful night's sleep and have recommended I try it. I had considered buying some a while back but decided to do my own research on it first only to find nightmares can be a side effect. I was wondering if anyone here that suffers with nightmares has tried it and how did it affect you?
NotSignal	Does anyone else have this or is it just me? Before the virus I had so much to worry about and I couldn’t sleep because I didn’t want the next day to come. I had school and responsibilities and I had soo much to do it’s insane, and now it’s all on pause. Last night I actually slept quite well for the first time in years and I didn’t even have nightmares. Sure I worry about the virus and friends and family, but the fact that I can do absolutely nothing about it except for staying home and avoid people is pretty nice.
Signal	I have had pretty bad nasal inflammation and congestion for past 6 weeks. Since all hospitals are closed due to carona I had a video visit. I was told to take decongestant. Had a very bad sensitivity reaction to that and it kept me up for 2 nights. I couldn't lay down. Felt like I had gallons of energy drink. That with difficulty to breath due to congestion gave me general and sleep anxiety. I have been taking buspar for that. Since then on some nights I sleep for 4 hours and some nights I sleep for 7. Last week since hospitals were open again, I went to ENT. He gave me Prednisone and antibiotics. I have taken 3, 20 mg pills of Prednisone till now. First night was okay, I was only up for 2 hours. Second night I could only sleep for 2-3 hours. Last night I couldn't sleep at all. I am very very tired. But not sleepy. I called my ENT (took some time to get to him because of the weekend). He told me to stop taking Prednisone. But now I am very afraid what if I can't sleep tonight? I can't go 3 nights without sleep. I think I will go insane. Any tips which can help me sleep tonight? I know I need to let go and not worry about sleeping in order to be calm enough to sleep but it's very difficult in practice.
NotSignal	I've been listening to Landslide for an hour and crying because I feel like I can't handle the seasons of my life and I built my life around someone......
NotSignal	Got work in 6 hours. Then once I get home tonight, I will have to turn around and go to sleep extra early to wake up at dawn on Friday.If i skip sleeping, I can be sure that I will be exhausted when I get home from work and pass out without incident.Im not tired right now, so I know sleep will be a problem tonight. It's pointless getting a few hours of sleep if I'm going to be exhausted anyway. At least I won't have to deal with waking up tomorrow morning, if I just skip sleep tonight.So, should I try to go to sleep or say screw it and medicate with coffee for the day until I get home tonight?
NotSignal	Another rough night. Sleeping pill not working (generic unisom, worked before) . I switched from sleeping in bed to the couch which sometimes helps. Nope not tonight. I was almost asleep then all the sudden awake for no reason it felt like I was being physically pulled up from sleeping. And I just get this sense of I'm not sleeping at all tonight and usually my feelings are right. I wish they made tranquilizers for humans I would take it.
NotSignal	Hey first time posting here. Hello all and i hope you are all safe and well.I've always had trouble sleeping. I'm a night owl and love the night time however life goes on and things have to be done during the day. So for years I would just stay up because once I go asleep, I'm out cold.Dealing with mental health issues since I'm a kid and of course drugs got involved just so I could fit in. Well that didn't work so most nights I'm up worrying about what has already happened and wish I could change it.I've been doing somewhat okish the past year with sleeping however it still gets me. The past 2 weeks have just been anxiety overdrive with everything going on in the world.I live alone and literally on the other side of Ireland from my family and a sister in OZ. Have no1 here to talk to really. So Tuesday night I just couldn't sleep and it came to about 8 o clock Wednesday morning when I lay down.Woke up late afternoon and so mad at myself. Love my sleep just not late afternoons because well you know the stigma. I woke up crying.So was feeling the same way this morning so I just stayed up again. After the 2 nights last week, the weekend I was doing good. Going to bed and getting up eary. Then boom it happens again. Sorry for my rambling. Always wanted to share something here so there you go.
Signal	For about 6 months straight I had a lot of trouble sleeping and would only usually get about 2-3 hours a night, sometimes zero. Recently, I’ve been gaining the capacity to sleep 6-8 hours again but I still feel that lack of energy and drowsiness during the day. How long does it take to get my mind and body on track again? Is there something else I need to do? I want to be able to work properly during the day and not rely on caffeine too much anymore.
NotSignal	Had to be up by 7 to go for blood work so I guess I just laid in bed for those 7 hours haha 🙃
NotSignal	Always take a piss too waking uo. Im 23 6'8 ~200 lns
NotSignal	Going back to sleep doesn’t help, even though I’m able to some of the time. It makes my head hurt when I do, and it feels like a half-awake zombie sleep. Most of the time I don’t want to go back to sleep anyways. How do I stop waking up so early and change my schedule?
NotSignal	Doctor gave me a small amount of this. Haven't slept due to very stressful news. If I get a good night of sleep I won't take it the next day. Anybody used this for short periods?
Signal	I’m sorry if this sounds really dumb, but is it possible? The past few days I have absolutely not been able to sleep. I feel like there’s a microwave or an old tv in my head and I’m thinking about 7 different things and also nothing at the same time. My whole body feels like a stubbed toe and my anxiety is through the roof. I finally was able to get a couple hours, but it was mostly just me laying in bed and drifting in and out of sleep. I couldn’t tell if I had even slept, but I recall feeling a puddle of drool on my pillow that I didn’t remember before, so I must have drifted off. I just woke up in a sweat-drenched panic and couldn’t move a muscle. I swore there was a man standing in my room. Sleep paralysis I think? Anyway, my eyes feel like I fell into a cactus and I’m just so confused. All I want to do is get some rest.
NotSignal	Hello this is my first time posting on this subreddit bc im experiencing s weird pattern of sleep. I’ll go to sleep at 10:30 and then wake up exactly around 1:50 AM and for the life of me i cannot sleep. I feel alert like my body is buzzing. I’d have to check if I’m shaking or if my heart is beating really fast but they’re not. I “look” completely normal but feel opposite. My body feels like my heart is beating fast and feels like my hands are shaking. I also get this funny feeling in my body like a jittery feeling. Then I won’t go into a full deep sleep after that. It will be a restless sleep and becomes a “time goes by really fast” kinda sleep. I wake up like I didn’t go to sleep or the feeling I’ve been awake for a while. I feel so restless at nights now I don’t know what to do. I sometimes wake up on the verge of sleep my whole body jerks and again I feel shaky and fast heart beat but it’s not fast. It’s normal. Idk what to do anymore what’s wrong with me?
Signal	100mg seroquel-7.5 mg Remeron-5 mg ambien-0.75 mg klonopin-5 mg melatonin-3 shots of vodkaI was awake the entire night. I know this list looks very concerning but I was desperate for something to happen and still no sleep. How is my insomnia this bad?? I also take Viibryd, Rexulti, and buspar in the daytime but my sleep didn’t get terrible again until the seroquel was added. I’ve tried not taking it for like 2 weeks but it really makes no difference whether I take it or not. But I don’t know how seroquel could’ve messed me up this bad
Signal	I’ve been struggling hard with insomnia. I’ve taken 2mg of lunesta, 1.5 mg of klonopin, and NyQuil and I still can’t sleep. Have you guys had any luck with any specific medication?
NotSignal	I’m a researcher and my team and I could easily build a library of audio based on cognitive science theories that help people sleep, not a silver bullet but shows promising results. I just don’t want to waste time if it’s something people are not interested. Should I build it or kill it?
Signal	I have had chronic insomnia for 11 years now (I'm 19) and sometimes I get to the point where I'm too bored to try and sleep because I know it won't work. This will happen no matter how tired I am or how late it is.
NotSignal	I'm usually sleeping from 11/12 pm to 2am and can't sleep until 4am to sleep till 6-7am. So I'm mostly getting a total of 4-6hours of sleep. Ik that this is not enough, but I could often sleep over day for again ~2hours (even though I mostly can't because I got a lot to do). I wondered if my way of sleeping (this on-off thingy) might be not normal or a problem. I sure feel dizzy and even sick sometimes because of a lack of sleep, but mostly I'm fine! I'm 18 yrs old and a student who'll graduate next year.
NotSignal	This is quite unusual for me, but I haven't gotten any sleep and have to work in a hour. I think I would just power through work if I had any other job, but the thing is I'm a chauffeur. So I think it might be quite dangerous. What do I do
Signal	i want to blow my brains out i can’t sleep at all anymore i have no idea what to fucking do with myself anymore i’m SO exhausted but i have so much shit keeping me up at night either way so even when i try to sleep i can’t and i’ve tried everything and it’s gonna be like this until friday and i feel like i’m going fucking crazy and i have so many things to do this week so many responsibilities every fucking day and i just want to stay in bed and i can’t. i’m getting so physically ill from it and i’d rather this just killed me sooner because it’s unbearable it just gets worse every night and i’m starting to fuckinf hallucinate and i want it to end so badly. fuck i needed to vent hahahah
Signal	I work as a telemarketer, and lately the stress from not getting sales and generally just failing with my duties is making me spiral down again the staircase of depression. Before the job, I slept well with medication, but lately even with medication my insomnia is coming back stronger and stronger. I no longer dream nor do I wake up feeling rested. I no longer get continuous sleep but I'm back to waking up in the middle of the night. I no longer feel tired in the evening but right after I get out of work and have eaten lightly, I'm ready to pass out and have a nap.
Signal	I've had insomnia since I can remember. My mom says by the age of 3 I would be awake for 24+ hour periods. This has continued on and off since childhood, but it's been especially bad the last 3 years. We have tried pretty much every off label drowsiness inducing medication (I.E. Medication prescribed by my doctor which isn't designed for sleep). We've also tried actual sleeping pills like ambien and zopiclone.Nothing has really worked except Seroquel for a while. I built up a tolerance to Seroquel until I was at a 300mg dose (way too high for insomnia treatment). I would sleep like a rock but I was so delirious throughout the day that I couldn't really function. I nearly lost my job because I'd fall asleep all day at work. My drivers license was suspended because I was at risk of falling asleep at the wheel. Seroquel let me sleep at night at the expense of falling asleep and being completely non functional during awake hours. I quit Seroquel several months ago because it was a vicious cycle. I'm now using 20mg of melatonin. I'm generally able to sleep from 4am till 7am but that's the most I can muster. I did a sleep study at the hospital hooked up to the machines for the night. The sleep doctor said he didn't really know what to tell me. With no obvious cause of my insomnia and pretty much every medication option exhausted, he told me it might just be a life long struggle. I really don't want to take this as a final answer. Since doing the sleep study last summer I've learned CBT-I. I don't stay in bed during waking hours, I do bedtime yoga to wind down, I only allow myself one cup of coffee shortly after waking up. I try really hard to not get bedtime anxiety, I repeat to myself "I'll be able to function tomorrow. 3 hours of sleep is enough", etc. Still, things aren't working. What multiple doctors and psychologists have never been able to tell me with a straight answer is this: Does insomnia always have a root cause? Is a "chemical imbalance" possible? I've had doctors tell me I'm basically screwed and just have a chemical imbalance, I've also had doctors tell me there must be an underlying cause that we've been unable to identify all these years. If it's true that insomnia always has a root cause, then I want to try really hard to find that cause on my own. It seems doctors are pretty much at a loss about what to do with my case now. I want to find a solution but it seems more and more likely that I do just have a "chemical imbalance" and that there is no solution.
NotSignal	Well, 6 months of insomnia have shown that this isn’t something that’s going to go away on it’s own. Dabbling with sleep meds, but that seems like a temporary solution at best. I’d like to give cbti an honest shot and am willing to invest a bit in it. Can anyone recommend any online courses ?
NotSignal	For the last week upon waking I am hearing what sounds like a stapler or nail gun to the point where it pisses me off because it feels like a loud noise preventing me from sleeping soundly. Once I get up and go to the bathroom, it’s gone. I believe these are called hypnopomic hallucinations. This freaks me out to where I hate going back to sleep because I don’t want to hear something that’s not there and then I worry if it’s a symptom of something more serious (narcolepsy, schizophrenia, etc. - I’m a 32 year old female for reference). I’ve noticed it usually happens when dreaming vividly - which isn’t uncommon for me. I’m curious if anyone suffers from something similar and if it’s same the same sound? Thanks guys.
Signal	I am prescribed .5mg Xanax half twice a day for my anxiety. But I use it purely to sleep, I take 4 tablets (2mg) in total along side 50mg of doxylamine tablets. Is this safe to do so? I do experience sleep paralysis from it a lot of the time but find it’s the only thing that helps me fall asleep and stay asleep, I also sleep for around 12+ hours on it which I know is probably a bit too much. If I don’t take this I am lucky to sleep 1-3 hours a night with multiple interruptions.
NotSignal	So stretching in general helps with relaxation and may make you sleep faster/better, but BACK STRETCHES in particular have been a game changer for me. I don't know why, but if I agressively stretch my back backwards and hold the exercises to squeeze my back muscles as much as possible it induces that sleepy feeling and I drop dead on the bed in a few seconds.The exercises I do with this are; **Single leg Bow Pose** Basically the same as the normal Bow Pose except that you do it with one leg, you want to hold your ankle very tightly then move your leg backwards AS FAR as possible to induce a very strong stretch, be aggressive when doing it and try to make the stretch as good as possible till you start shaking.Drop on your stomach and repeat with the other leg. **Hero Pose Back Stretch**Youre going to sit on Hero Pose palms on your knees, then you'll bend your spine backwards, dont tilt your head, you want to feel the stretch in the lower back, BEND BEND BEND, always be aggressive with the stretch till you shake and get a really good squeeze for a few seconds. Then get back to Hero Pose hands on knees.**Hero Pose Middle Back Stretch**Youre going to sit on Hero Pose and put your hands together as if youre doing a Yoga Prayer, then lift your hands up and bend BACKWARDS, youll feel it in the middle of your back, Stretch stretch stretch as far back as you can while focusing the stretch on the middle of your back. Then get back to hero pose.**Hero Pose Upper Back Stretch**.You want to sit on Hero Pose then bend your head backwards, you will feel the stretch right below your neck and shoulder area, STREEEEETCH as hard as you can till you shake then drop dead on the bed. You will feel your back muscles activated and you might start breathing rapidly, and if you did the exercises aggressively you should feel yourself entering a coma and about to have uninterrupted sleep. Try it and let me know if you need help with the proper form of each stretch or anything like that.
Signal	since april 2020 i’ve got insomnia, in all my life i never had sleeping problems at all, even when my beloved grandpa died. everything started with corona, i isolated myself and my son since beginning of the year and the day we went to visit my brother in his garden ( so my son could play there) it all happened. like a switch, i felt like i did not even want to sleep and i couldn’t. 2 nights in a row it went on like this and then the third night i could not sleep, i called the depression hotline and afterwards i slept for like 2h and felt refreshed. since then i have good and bad nights but many times i have nocturnal problems and wake every 1-2 hours and sometimes have trouble falling asleep again. sometimes i keep tossing and turning all night and manage to get 2 hours sleep in the morning. ive been so crazy, i thought i have sporadic fatal insomnia, went to several doctors, had a full body ct and blood tests done and everything is fine. they say it’s my psych, so i went to therapy and yet nothing much changed. i don’t wanna live on like this anymore and wonder what can i do to finally break this cycle :( i need help.
Signal	I went to bed early because I have an important day today, but of course my brain kept me fully awake all night so after 6 hours of lying in bed I just gave up and got ready for work early. I’m on my feet all day and I just need to stay functioning until 5pm, any tips ?? My insomnia intensifies whenever I need to get up early or have something important on the next day, it’s just the worst but it happens!
NotSignal	Hey friends, &#x200B;Was in this subreddit last week during a bout of insomnia that lasted four days. Finally got some sleep and reset my cycle, except started waking up earlier and earlier. Woke up this morning (yesterday) at 4AM. Now I'm here at 4AM again and still haven't fallen asleep. Giving up now. &#x200B;I think I must be getting hypomanic. I'm bipolar type 1, and this could be really bad. Very worried for what this coming week will bring.
NotSignal	It feels like not sleeping will mean that tomorrow won’t start so soon. I usually dread the mornings as it means I’ll have to go through with another day.
Signal	I would like to be asleep now. There's no rational reason why I should be fully awake. This is not normal.
Signal	I remember when going through my worst insomnia episode ever, it was ruining my life to the point where I was constantly on another plane of consciousness, severely depressed, becoming paranoid to the point of displaying schizophrenia symptoms and contemplating suicide. And yet when I went to the doctor and explained it was ruining my life they just went “oh okay so you’ve got a bit of insomnia, try mEdiTaTion and avoiding screens before bed etc etc. I can prescribe you some ~NatuRaL~ Valerian ‘sleep inducing’ pills (aka: placebo bullshit to get me to shut up) Didn’t work obviously, and because I was too agreeable to argue that it was more serious than ‘just a couple weeks of bad sleep cos I stayed up till 3am all the time playing video games’ like so many ungrateful regular-sleeping people do, I never got taken seriously and given the help I needed which almost cost me my life and my high school diploma. Long story short: LOOK THEM DEAD IN THE EYE AND DEMAND SOME GODAMN EFFORT because life is too short to suffer without help because doctors don’t take the severity of your suffering seriously. Nag. Beg. Abuse the system until someone gets you into some therapy and onto some godamn horse tranquilliser. You need to be taken seriously. YOU. DESERVE. PROPER. HELP. Don’t make the same mistake I did. Thank you and goodnight.
Signal	All I want is one hour of sleep but I just can’t get it and I can’t take it anymore.
NotSignal	I have chronic insomnia. It’s pretty crippling. It’s cute to say to turn off lights/screens at night to help sleep. That’s not the real world we live in. I can’t go computer and screen dark after nightfall. So next best thing? I got red tinted safety glasses that are meant for red/blue laser. Hope they block out green/blue light. Wear them at night and see if it helps me fall asleep better. I don’t mind the red hue. Anyone else try it? Think it will help? I’m being realistic about screen use, this seems like good harm reductions.Glasses are: HDE laser eye protection red tint
Signal	Hello fellow insomniacs,I work nights, so I sleep during the day, if I sleep at all. I’ve been having a really rough go lately, as NONE of my sleep meds are working (seroquel and Xanax).When do manage to drift off after several agonizing hours, I get woken up by either one of the neighbors and their fucking lawn service just going ham with the leaf blower or one of their dogs barking it’s bloody head off.Unfortunately there are loud/noisy neighbors on both sides of me.I wear noise cancelling headphones and have complained about the dogs several times. But here I am, struggling to sleep and trying not to go into a homicidal rage every time I hear a leaf blower.Any suggestions?
Signal	New to this sub, I'm hoping this is okay to discuss because I'd appreciate feedback if anyone else has experienced this. I've had lifelong insomnia but it's gotten completely out of control the last year or so. I sleep 2 or 3 hours, often not until 7 or 8 in the morning, and often skip nights completely. Amazingly I'm somewhat acclimated and still functioning semi normally, but I know it's bad and nothing I've tried has worked. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for years about it.It's not uncommon for me to lie completely still for hours, and it looks like I'm asleep, but I'm not. I'm still totally conscious. My body feels heavy like it's in mild sleep paralysis. After awhile I'll start actively dreaming. It's not at all like lucid dreaming where I'm asleep but aware of the dreams (I do get those fairly often and always have so the difference is distinct). I'm awake, conscious, dreaming, thinking about whether I really am awake or asleep or if I'm hallucinating or if this is something even weirder. It's very strange. It's like part of my mind is in sleep mode but the other part is flat refusing to cooperate and will NOT go to sleep, and is commenting on the part that's actually sleeping. It will continue for hours until I either fully wake up or fully sleep. Usually the former. When the tiredness gets too much I've also started actually hallucinating in mild, dreamy ways. If I can't sleep and give up I might read for awhile, and the words will completely change but I won't notice right away and will keep reading. Not anything bizarre, but if I go back I realize I read a page or something that isn't there. Or I'll see regular things that don't exist, like a cup on my nightstand or a pile of clothes on the floor I already put away. Shit is getting weird yo. These are new developments that coincide with a drastic increase in severity of my insomnia. Has anyone else experienced these kinds of things? I've hesitated to have a sleep study because I know I won't sleep, so I don't see the point. Staying awake for a night or two in a hospital would be a walk in the park for my asshole brain.
NotSignal	Going to bed anytime before 23 will inevitably wake me up only a few hours later. Sometimes, when I feel tired somewhat early (21-22), I like to capitalize on it and try to get a good night's sleep, but I always end up waking up at 1-2-3 in the morning instead. But if I go to sleep at 23-24-1, I'm somehow able to sleep until the actual morning. Why is that? Does my body register it as a nap instead
NotSignal	I’m not going to sleep with drugs I know my delay phase sleep disorder and high cortisol. I don’t count my days anymore I’m used to this
NotSignal	So I have had sleeping problems all my life, but didnt really ask mich until this year. But when I was a baby, my mother always had problems with me to sleep and never wanted to sleep, and ever since i was 6/7 years old I was always every night thinking: «why cant i sleep? How do i sleep? How can other people sleep so easy compared to me?» and i searched up many times on how to sleep, but nothing worked. And now i barely get any sleep. I dont get sleep for many days and when i fall asleep I need atleast 3 hours of trying to fall asleep. Its not only falling asleep that is extremely hard for me, but also staying asleep is hard; i will wake up from anything. Is this what u would call insomia or something? And is it like possible to have chornic insomnia or what would you call this «behavior»? And is there anything i can do to fall asleep bettet that i havent heard of (suggestions??)?
Signal	Wow haha great the benzo that was supposed to help me fucked with my head instead hahaha oh my god please save me from this hell I think I blacked out for a few hours maybe I'm just praying I got some kind of deep uninterrupted sleep at this point
Signal	Hello friends , i’m curious to know , has anyone ever experienced waking up multiple times a night ? I don’t know if it’s because of my new meds (buspar 5mg twice a day & 15mg of remeron before bed) . But i’m wondering what has helped anyone of you that have experienced waking up multiple times a night , i practice sleep hygiene and stay off my phone about an hour before bed , i sleep in the dark with white noise (fans) and i always wake up multiple times a night. If anyone can give me tips on how they dealt with it i’d greatly appreciate it. (: thanks
Signal	I’ve struggled with insomnia my entire life, I had childhood insomnia, and it’s only gotten worse as I’ve gotten older. I know most of it is my fault because my sleep hygiene is absolutely terrible: I sleep with the tv on and have the HARDEST time setting a strict time to get off my phone; the idea gives me anxiety and then I can’t sleep even more. I’ve talked to my therapist about this numerous times, but I still haven’t been successful getting to turn the electronics off... Do any of you insomniacs have advice on how to get into the routine of no electronics after I certain time? I take hydroxyzine as needed, as I’ve exhausted all my other sleep aid options and I medicate with cannabis to help finally doze off. I feel like a zombie these days and just want to feel normal again 💔
NotSignal	BETTER THAN I EVER DID...Birds singing, sun is shining, it is 4AM!
NotSignal	And there is a burning feeling all over the body like a full body version of when you hold your breath to your limit, or when you sprint til exhaustion, but not in the lungs, like all over the body and head. It only gets better when I get up and walk around. If i don't get up i keep feeling it.
NotSignal	I've recently found out that I have less testosterone than the average male, I've also been given tips on how to naturally increase it, my situation is that I've had trouble staying asleep and often wake up during the night and have trouble sleeping in. Is there a chance I might actually be able to sleep a full 8 hours if my testosterone levels are normal?
Signal	Does anyone else feel like they never learned how to just go to sleep? I remember being a kid and watching my friends knock out instantly at a sleepover and never understanding it. I feel like I just lay there and wait. Like hours pass I can't just not think, so I'm thinking about everything I didn't think about during the day. It feels like I've been missing something my whole life.Does anyone understand what I mean?
NotSignal	This scares me from falling asleep I feel electric shocks everytime I’m trying to sleep I have no idea what that is has anybody ever had it
Signal	I'm just so frustrated with my sleep patterns and weird horrible dreams! I feel so tired all the time no matter what. I'm fed up with trying.
Signal	I’ve been doing everything to fix this and it’s so frustrating because I normally sleep so easily. It’s 5:30am now and this is the 3rd night during lockdown I will have no sleep. My sleep schedule is fucked and I keep having so much anxiety about sleep to the point I literally can’t sleep. I’ve been working out nearly everyday so lack of exercise isn’t the problem. Idk what to do anymore I would love some help please. I’m open to any advice
Signal	Well maybe I snack and binge watch because I'm not sleeping. I'm tired and awake at a time when everyone around me is fast asleep. I'm tired and still brightly awake. I'm just waiting for the alarm clock to ring so that I can get on with my day.
NotSignal	en I’m sleep deprived I don’t even feel sleepy. If I was sleepy I could just take a nap and it would solve the problem. Instead, I just feel foggy and anxious and bad.
NotSignal	My sleeping schedule is usually going to bed at 4:00 am and waking up at 7:40 am however, I never feel that tired compared to when I sleep early. Is this normal? I need your opinions.
NotSignal	I was so desperate to get some sleep tonight that I thought: “surely I’ll sleep if I drink enough”3 liters of beer and half a bottle of vodka later, I feel like I was run over by multiple trains, but still can’t sleep to save my life.I can’t go on like this
Signal	A friend told me to look into seriphos for my insomnia. It works to repair unbalanced adrenals and cortisol, which from what I’ve read about so far seems very similar to my situation. It seems my adrenals and cortisol work in overdrive at night, which makes me totally restless at night but extremely foggy and tired all day. It was very nice to hear a new recommendation other than “have you ever tried melatonin?” I’ve tried so many things, but I hadn’t heard of seriphos. It seems worth a try, has anyone tried this before?
NotSignal	Maybe this is a stupid question I guess I’m just looking for some feedback before I decide if I’m going to mention this at my next dr appointment. This all kinda stems back to my childhood, the earliest I remember, being 4 years old just laying awake at night in my parents bed because I couldn’t sleep. I know I had a lot of anxiety as a child, once I started sleeping in my own room I was terrified the house would burn down so every night I would go to sleep wearing a sweatshirt full of my favorite stuffed animals and toys and there was a backpack full of everything I’d want Incase of a fire. And then around 9 years old I saw part of the movie The Haunting in Connecticut when my grandma was watching it which cause me to be extremely afraid of ghost. The only way I could feel safe sleeping is if I was under a thick blanket with my mouth and nose covered by the blanket. And then high school came around and there were many days I didn’t sleep at all through the night. As I got older obviously I realize a fire was unlikely and I personally don’t believe in ghost but now I’m a full time mom of 2 girl under the age of 3 (youngest being 6 months) so you’d think I’d be passing out the moment my head hit the pillow. Except most nights it’s 3am when I start feeling sleepy and I finally telling myself okay you really need to go to sleep since the kids both wake up around 8am. There aren’t many nights where I go to sleep before 1am. Occasionally I’ll nap during the day when I put my youngest down for a nap but that’s maybe 1 time a week. I know as a kid I definitely had trouble falling asleep but now as an adult when I’m tired I have no problem falling asleep (staying asleep is a little questionable since I do have a breastfeeding baby but I think if she wasn’t waking up through the night I would sleep until waking) I just don’t feel tired until 3am no matter how little sleep I get. So I guess I’m just wondering if this sounds like it could be insomnia or if I just don’t sleep. Sorry if this is a little confusing feel free to ask questions
Signal	I am fairly new to this community and only lurked around for solutions to my insomnia problem that didn’t involve pills (though I do think they help)My insomnia was pretty general: I couldn’t sleep longer than an hour a night, melatonin gave me sleep paralysis/ just doesn’t work, and I couldn’t close my eyes, even if I was exhaustedI had insomnia for a year, and as a full time student, the depression was hitting hard. I thought the phrase “sleep when I’m dead” was becoming an optionI felt pretty hopeless, as my mother wouldn’t get me help because she thought I was exaggerating about my sleep problems.Then, for Christmas, my step grandmother got me a sleeping mask. She got it because she’s the human form of Mr. Crabs and won’t spend more than $3 on a gift, but I couldn’t be more thankfulI could never shut my eyes at night, but with the mask, i can. Even if they do manage to open, all they’ll see is complete darkness. I’ve been using it since December 26, and I have slept every night since (for at least 6 hours!!)Now, I still go to bed late (not on my own accord) and I don’t instantly fall asleep, but damn. I feel so rested and happy.I know the solution to insomnia is different for everyone, and maybe this won’t work for you, but this is a cheep and drug-free solution that I hope everyone will try! TL;DR : A sleeping mask helped my insomnia go away
NotSignal	So I am experiencing the worst insomnia for the first time in my life and I am unable to fall asleep. The only way I can describe it is I am completely exhausted all day and try to nap then I notice myself going into a pre-sleep stage and get the most weirdest/random thoughts then i consciously realising what I’m thinking and in like wtf? Then I’m like screw that and I’m unable to go past this stage. This also happens at night and I feel like I’m going crazy. Please help
NotSignal	As the title says whenever I have work in the morning I cant sleep but if I don't I can sleep just fine I don't understand
Signal	Please just let me sleep. My insomnia meds are ineffective and now every time I do try to sleep I get up to pee maybe 12 times before I finally succumb to a little sleep.
Signal	Yesterday I could hardly eat because of my lack of energy from the last bad couple nights of sleep. My vision feels blurry at times. I've been going to bed around 5-8PM to fall asleep around 12-1AM and wake up around 3AM.Even after nights of good sleep I feel drained, no energy to use my muscles.I've tried extra strong melatonin before and it did nothing at all, I've also added extra sheets and same thing.I don't know what else to try.
NotSignal	Hi! Right now it 01:59 am in my country and I need to wake up at 5 am. I’ve tried falling asleep for almost three hours now but I just can’t. I can never fall asleep in under 2 hours (ofc there are exceptions where I can fall asleep in like 40min but it’s very rare) I don’t know if I have insomnia or not. I never wake up during my sleep and most often I don’t feel very tired the next day, only in the mornings. Basically my only problem is that I cannot fall asleep. It’s been like this for a few years (I’m 16) and I’ve tried sooo many different things to make me fall asleep that I looked up on google but nothing works! Does anyone know the cause? Or if this is insomnia?
Signal	I've done a ton of research and heard a lot of advice about how to improve your sleep and tried implementing various combinations until I gave up. It was only when I had given up on 'the good habits', when I started trying anything, contrary to popular belief or no, that I found some success.Since then I have found that if I listen to loud music and do some sedentary activity that requires massive amounts of concentration I get to sleep a little bit earlier and stay asleep for longer. For example: I listen to metal or techno on high volume noise cancelling headphones while playing 90's-difficulty video games or listen to opera and draw something intricate.Please note that I have other clinically diagnosed conditions that probably play a factor in why this works for me. In case they're relevant they are: ADHD, autism, depression, anxiety, OCD and hypermobility. To combat these I'm on fluoxetine, concerta and norgesic.Does anyone have a similar experience with experimentation yielding unexpected results?And does anyone have any suggestions of other sedentary and intricate tasks I could perform?
Signal	Because the sleep servers are full.Im so fucking pissed because of this shitty insomnia, having suicidal thoughts lately.PLEASE SOMEONE HELP!
Signal	Hi All,&#x200B;I am a longtime insomnia sufferer, I also have ADHD and depresseion. For the last few months I am on Zolpidem 10 mg + Melatonin 3 mg + Clonazepam 0.25 mg for sleep. In the morning I take Bupropion 300 mg + Modafinil 50 mg.&#x200B;Before starting medication, It used to take more than 2 hours for me to fall asleep, used to wake-up in between.After starting medication, I am able to fall asleep quickly. But wake-up very tired and not refreshed at all.&#x200B;But for the past few days,I am waking-up at midnight and can't go back to sleep at all.At first it was around 6 hours after falling asleep, then it was 4 hours, now I wake-up even after 2 hours and can't go back to sleep. My dayshave become a mess. I follow all the recommended sleep hygiene advise and do regular exercise.&#x200B;Can anybody please suggest what to do? Should I try some other combination of medicines ?Edit: formattingEdit2: I have gotten sleep study done, I don't have sleep-apnea, although I have excessive daytime sleepiness.
Signal	Any other insomniac parents here? I'm due in july with my first bub. I have been on quetiapine for insomnia since I was 18 (23F) and honestly dont remember the last time I slept without medication or bud. Even after smoking, my sleep would still be meh. My brain just doesnt reach REM sleep, so I constantly feel like I'm partially awake. I'm concerned about being on meds when I have a baby, that I'll feel worse because I wont have a chance to fully sleep off the meds during the babies very erratic sleep schedule, but I'm also terrified that i wont sleep at all if I dont take the meds. It seems like an awful circle and right now, my only line of thinking is "let's hope parenthood is as fucking terrible as everyone says and makes me an exhausted zombie!". Have any of you had luck with ANYTHING when you had a baby? Or luck with being on sleep meds while having a kid? I get tired and exhausted, just cannot reach any type of productive sleep.Side note, my semi lucid sleep talking has now transcended into sleep texting. Pregnancy is whack.
NotSignal	Whaddup peeps, reporting to you after a full night lying awake with my eyes closed. My whole life I used to sleep on my side/belly with my arm under my pillow. I know that this position sucks, but it’s the only one I was comfortable with, and couldn’t sleep in any other one. Maybe on my back sometimes, but under certain conditions (like if I wake up early in the morning it would be easier to fall asleep on my back for some reason. It’s also a gateway to trippy lucid dreams)Like two months ago, suddenly this position became uncomfortable. My arm started hurting and my neck feels bent. I’m trying to sleep in other positions but usually I’m just tossing and turning until I get so tired I fall asleep faster than my arm and my neck start to hurt.Does anyone else sleep in this position? Is there like a special pillow for it? With like a cutout for the arm?
Signal	I've been addicted to benadryl for about 3 years now, for sleeping. I take too much every day for sleep, maybe up to 200-300mg (not all a once) Please help me I don't want to die. I'm 28. Does anyone have any advice to stop.
Signal	My heart rate has increased a lot during the last few weeks (sometimes my heart rate goes up to 130 bpm when resting) and heart palpitations are getting more and more frequent. It’s like my heart’s skipping a beat or I have a feeling that’s it’s going out of my chest. This feeling comes when i’m standing up. Everyone tells me it’s anxiety and nobody is worried. I’m pretty sure its due to insomnia. Does it mean I have a heart problem? I’m probably overthinking but is there a chance that i might die from heart palpitations?
Signal	I can't sleep at nights. I can only sleep when it passed 11 am. I can't sleep when everybody is sleeping for 2 days which is very weird to me because i like to sleep. I dont know if it counts as insomnia but i'm really worried that it can be the start. What should i do?
NotSignal	I've been laying in bed for about 4 hours now just trying to fall asleep and I've given up and decided to just spend the rest of the grueling hours before I have to start my day on Reddit.
Signal	Hi I am a 60-year-old female and I’ve had insomnia for decades. I’ve tried everything including a variety of meds. It comes and goes depending on my capacity to put all the pieces together and good sleep hygiene. I was offered the opportunity to try something new at a party and afterwords the host said I bet you sleep good tonight. And she was right! I had some of the best sleep I’ve had in years!I gather it is new to the US, and I don’t know how widely distributed it is here. But I would like to see what I can do to get my hands on one. It was a big mat that generates Rife frequencies. It literally only takes eight minutes for a treatment. Apparently it opens up the capillaries. It felt like it was sitting in a warm bath. I loved it.I didn’t fall asleep right away but when I did I had a very restorative sleep and effect seem to have lingered for a while—about a week now. I’m at a very stressful point in my life I am at care provider for my ex who was just diagnosed with lung cancer. Apparently chiropractors use this before doing an adjustment because it helps relax the body.I have not had time to do any research on this so if anyone wants to pick that up that would be awesome. Thanks!
Signal	Hello r/insomnia, not sure if this is the right place to post this although it has a lot to do with the insomnia I've suffered for pretty much the past 11 months minus the past 1-1.5 months. Unfortunately even after I've recovered insomnia affects my life, in this case large under eye bags that haven't really changed at all since my insomnia stopped. How the fuck do you get rid of these? My sleep therapist said it will take multiple months for a small improvement which is very disheartening and she isn't even sure if they'll ever recover to what they were like pre-insomnia which is depressing as shit.Do cucumbers actually help? Or does that help with bags that develop more so due to aging rather than insomnia? Some kind of cosmetic while they take their sweet time to heal? Unfortunately I'm a dude so that option is probably instantly thrown out the window as make-up is a one gender thing, how fair.Once again if this is the wrong place to post this I'll delete it, just wanted some advice because this is bugging me a lot.
NotSignal	Hey all. I used to have some real bad insomnia, but I have tackled the root cause of issue and now only have occasional sleepless nights.I was wondering if anybody has had success with sleep aids that you can get on Amazon that are *not* antihistamines. I see a lot of capsules that are concoctions of magnesium, GABA, melatonin, etc, but I don’t know if any of them really work.Can anybody give me a solid recommendation for something that can help with mild sleep issues with minimal repercussions?
Signal	I'm taking melatonin for about 10 month now, for the first couple of month it worked perfectly but since then it isn't working(actually it got worse ), someone know why?(Sorry for bad english)
NotSignal	I plan to just take them today so I can sleep early tonight and fix my sleep schedule for the next few weeks. Wish me luck!
Signal	What’s worse, not being able to sleep and staying up or; not being able to sleep yet feeling the effects of the sleep medication making you loopy but not actually putting you to sleep? And I have a job interview tomorrow. My insomnia seems to know when important things are going to happen. Is my insomnia self aware? Probably
NotSignal	Looked through a bunch of posts about hypnagogic hallucinations but didn't see anything about tactile. For me it'll be like I'm going to sleep and something grabs my leg, or hits me, and I jolt awake. Last night it was something that slapped me four times on the stomach. Other times it'll be insects and ants crawling over me.I was wondering what your experiences were with this?
NotSignal	Normies don't get this when it comes to sleep, they are constantly getting 6-8 hours a night, yet when we get that, it's a miracle. I get jealous of people who can fall asleep so fast and stay asleep. They take sleep for granted, and sometimes look at you like how are you not sleeping you're crazy. Not sleeping is making me crazy and you don't know what you're talking about, lol.
Signal	It makes me very tired, drowsy, slow, unmotivated throughout the day. This is so frustrating because I finally found a drug that does a great job at putting me to sleep but now I'm tired all day because of it.What should I do? Is there any medication that's similar to Vistaril that doesn't make you tired all the time?
NotSignal	I've had insomnia doe as long as I can remember. I'll be so sleepy but can't fall asleep. I can be awake for 48 hours at least once a month. When I do sleep, I wake up after just 3 hours, then I'm awake again and can't get back to sleep.I've noticed that I'll nod off for just a few minutes. I can tell it's not very long by watching a youtube video to see how long I was out via timestamps in the video. I researched this and they're called microsleeps. They're kind of scary actually. That's not the weirdest part. It seems like my body ”skips” over sleep phases and goes right to dreaming. I can close my eyes for just a minute or so and have a full on dream. The kind that seems to be hours. However, I've only been out for 2-3 minutes. My SO he witnessed these microsleeps and assures me I was only ”sleeping” a few minutes. This has been increasing in frequency and now I'm experiencing lucid dreams. I'm fully away that I'm asleep and dreaming. It's very strange. Like an out of body experience almost. Has anyone else experienced this? I've read that you don't/cant dream that fast, but it seems like I slip right into dreaming.
NotSignal	I haven’t been able to sleep and I feel like total shit. I called out agin and insomnia is 99% of the sick days I’ve taken. I hate this so much. I made an appointment with sleep medicine, but it’s not until October. I’m so miserable right now
Signal	Someone else's post made me think of this.Due to both genetic health issues and a traumatic childhood, I spent 5/6 of my life with very little sleep and in severe pain. I've dealt with and solved a huge amount of health problems but still have a ways to go. At age 30, I am sleeping better, half the weight I was as a teenager, and am able to walk without crutches. My mental health is much better as well. As a teen and 20s, I was severely depressed and anxious as well as obsessive about things to an extreme (like stalkerish). Now, I still have bad anxiety and manic moments but I'm more laid back in general. I've started to feel lately like I'm almost manic when I've slept well. (My mother had undiagnosed bipolar symptoms so I'm all too familiar with extreme mood swings.) I have anxiety and am frustated about the final health symptoms I'm working on now as well as some life setbacks. However, when I have slept well, I feel like I get even more frustrated about these symptoms. In the past, I was in so much pain and so tired that I just kind of existed and was too tired to do anything.Has anyone else experienced something similar with mania?
NotSignal	Yay. Have work in a few hours. The exhaustion is gonna hit me later in the day. I guarantee it. Blehhhh.
Signal	This happened recently when my workload increased, coupled with work from home arrangements due to COVID-19. I go to bed thinking about my to-do list and trying to figure out if I've missed out anything in my work. And my mind cannot relax. I've tried to do other things to keep my mind occupied before sleeping like reading and exercise, and even tried listening to soothing music, but it always takes me more than an hour to fall asleep. Also, I'm waking up at the same exact time of 7:30am no matter what time I slept. (I usually only fall sleep between 2-3am I think)I really have no energy in the morning and this has caused me to lose my appetite as well. What should I do?
NotSignal	Right, i havent slept in the past 36 hours and i hardly feel sleepy at all (except my eyes are really tired). Ive had episodes of not sleeping for 24 hrs or so but then i would be absolutely sleepy and fall asleep for 8 hrs or more. Along this time i came across two terms that now scare the fuck out of me SFI and FFI, i wish i never read a single word about them. While i know that i dont have it but the thought of this every time i lay down to sleep takes every second of sleep i will ever have and i cant stop thinking about it. If any of you havent slept for 3 or 4 days and somehow managed to fix your sleep schedule, please share your tips.Thanks in advance
NotSignal	I was always taught to try for that magic 8 hours. Bed at 11 to get up at 7. Should I just wait till 1am and instead of tossing and turning and try for 5 or 6 hours instead
NotSignal	I use the Pillow app every night. My sleep quality percentage is usually in the 50s. I can’t find any references online for how this compares to others or what is “ideal.”Does anyone know what different sleep quality percentages actually mean?
NotSignal	I get maybe 2-3 hours a night if I'm lucky. I'll fall asleep 11:30 to midnight and wake up at 2 AM and I can't fall back asleep. Melatonin does nothing. Ambien does nothing. I went to a sleep therapist and it's all bologna for me. My heart rate is fast and my chest feels tight. I can imagine my blood pressure is way up there. The doctors have been useless. I feel like shit all the time. I lay my head down at night and it feels like my brain just can't create the ability to be tired. I'll lay there for hours until morning.
Signal	I know this might sound stupid, but I honestly think this might be the best subreddit to ask for advice relating to this.Because of this whole pandemic lockdown, my sleep schedule has been totally flipped to night shift type of schedule. No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to flip it back to waking up in the morning. My biological clock is just getting used to falling asleep around 8 or 9 in the morning and waking up around 5 or 6pm.Here is the thing... I lay in bed around 12 at night hoping that tomorrow will be the magical day that I will some how wake up in the morning. Time slowly passes while I get anxious that I can’t sleep and will continuously creating this bad cycle that I will never break. By the time I see the sunshine peeking under my curtain, I just think that “here I am... fucking this up again” Here is not the worst part... I’m an absolute horrible person if someone wakes me up. My husband tried everything to wake me up, and no matter what sort of method (giving me coffee that I ended up spilling on myself, violently shaking me, speaking to me... etc) I will just go back to sleep. Also even if I am fully awake, I will get this weird feeling in my chest that can only be best described as heart getting shocked (or jump started). That feeling is so uncomfortable to the point that I will snap at people in the worst way possible. Anyone with these sort of problem? (Relating to this anxiety of not falling asleep) What about the feeling of getting shocked in the chest while waking up? Side note: tried melatonin but honestly it only puts me to sleep earlier. I still wake up around 5 or 6pm. Currently not on prescription insomnia medication (which will be the last resort) The main issue here is just how difficult it is to fall asleep/maintaining a good sleep hygiene while dealing with anxiety relating to not able to sleep
Signal	My doctor gave me 2 medications that did nothing for me sleep wise, but turned me into a zombie the next day. I’ve been taking CBD oil for 4 days, drinking camomile tea, melatonin, other herbal supplements, diffused camomile roman before “bed”. I made an appointment for acupuncture Saturday. It’s the worst feeling in the world feeling like my own doctor can’t help me. I basically just cry all night because I want sleep. I messaged her earlier today asking for help again and she said to keep trying the CBD and if not she would give me trazodone in a few days. My friend said it’s a hell of a drug and said I should try to avoid it if I can, she has first hand experience with it with her patients. I’m a stay at home mom and need to be able to care for her the next day. Should I ask for a blood test? Is there anything they could even see from that? I don’t know what else to do at this point, I can’t stop crying and feeling like I’m never going to sleep again.
Signal	I can’t sleep, I’m so restless and a headache now Can’t go outside Can’t fall asleep Just sit here what now
Signal	taking 2 mg xanax, 20 mg melatonin, 25 mg seroquel, 10 mg amitriptyline, 200 mg gabapentin... dying to see what goes on tonight.
NotSignal	I don’t sleep a lot. Or sometimes I crash super hard and sleep the day away. But I have never been diagnosed with any kind of sleep disorder. Instead, I got other diagnoses: Anxiety, depression, PTSD, RTS. Safe to say I don’t sleep well. I had two years of nightmares, and I rarely slept through the night. With prazosin and a sedative, I finally sleep a little bit. I don’t mean to self diagnose or claim to be an insomniac. But I figure this sub might be a good place for a nudge in the right direction. Do you think this counts as any kind of sleep problem or issue? Is there a better way to describe how poorly I sleep?
Signal	I've been struggling with insomnia for a while now and it sucks. I just found out about this subreddit during another sleepless night and I cried while reading through your posts. It's nice to know that I'm not alone and I can get through this.
Signal	I get so lonely and sad when my husband goes to sleep at a decent hour and I’m just sitting in the bed next to him mind racing and frustrated beyond words. It just makes me want to cry. Haven’t had my meds since we got to our new duty station in AUGUST bc they’re not seeing patients and my PCP won’t scribe them for me.
NotSignal	After battling with insomnia since quarantine, I’ve started an ASMR/Sleep Meditation channel and because I’m new in the game, I know I have a lot to learn. I’m curious, what sounds or kind of music personally help you fall asleep best?
NotSignal	So I tried taking a nap at like 4:00pm, I was in a state that was about to fall asleep but this stupid myoclonus on my right leg ruined that ruined that. And now I cant get back to that state, is it because I'm not really extremely tired like when it's really time for bedtime? Now this failed attempt at nap is making me think if this also happens tonight.
NotSignal	If so, does it affect your sleep? Is it bad for insomnia? Research suggests that creatine might aid sleep deprived people even their objective is not being swole. On the other hand, i saw a meme from IG that insinuates about the not having enough sleep due to consumption of pre-workout (creatine).
Signal	On average 1/4 of the month i have trouble sleeping, falling a sleep and the few hours i sleep the sleep quality is equal to zero. On that days i feel like im going to break mentaly and find it hard to do most basic tasks either at work or at home. I have specific job so im either on construction site doing physical work or on the road with the van so having a short nap is not really an option. What do you do on these days, lots of coffe and redbull or there is less agressive solution? all suggestions are welcome. also, do sleeping pills really help? was thinking of getting them for some time nowi should also mention i very active person and i try to live as healty as i can (i dont drink, smoke, eat very processed food, have low sugar intake...)
Signal	Hi everyone,So I have a trazodone prescription to help manage my insomnia/sleeping issues, but this prescription was issued in the United States. I'm now living in France, and the doctors here apparently cannot issue the same medication. Is anyone here from Europe and happen to have a prescription to trazodone in their home country? I'm willing to fly/take a train to other countries nearby to get my damn prescription lmaoThanks!
NotSignal	Hi, a simple question for anybody experienced with taking Trazodone. If I want to be asleep by 11pm, what time should I take my pill? Thanks for any advice
NotSignal	Anyone live alone and are haunted by repressed memories that come up as somatization during the day and feel like there’s unaddressed things that wake you up?
NotSignal	It's almost 2 a.m. for me... I don't know what triggered it but, my mind simply doesn't want to sleep. I started obsessing over what sleep was and why we need it and now it's like my brain doesn't want to participate in it because of its mysterious nature. Has this happened to anyone before? How can I overcome this?
Signal	I (20f) have been on 25 mg of seroquel since august but i do not like the side effects so I want to switch medications. Does anyone know of an anti-anxiety medication that also works for insomnia? I have had insomnia and generalized anxiety since I was 13 and ambien and doxepine didn’t work for me
Signal	Insomnia is back and it's not pretty, I managed to sleep 1h last night (from 6:30 am to 7:30 am) despite me taking my sleep medication. Just asking in case I get the same amount of sleep tonight.
NotSignal	Has anyone ever tried to fall asleep by making themselves pass out by using the breathing trick? You hyperventilate sitting, then stand up and hold your breath (over Ur bed or whatever). Has anyone tried that and other than potentially hitting your head is it dangerous?
Signal	My psychiatrist prescribed me Dalmadorm instead of Mirtazapine because i was having some side effects.He prescribed it to me for my insomnia and i wanted to know, does it works? How it works?
Signal	**Backstory:** (Most uninteresting not as important part, you can skip it)So.. Not wanting to sleep has been a problem since I was a child. It started with fearing the time I would have to go up and go to school.I started sleeping little to nothing, then the periods where my body would catch up on sleep became longer and more intense. I think the longest I’ve slept is like 19 hours of no waking up in between. Sleeping 12+ hours became an everyday thing throughout my teens. And I’d always stay up past midnight, so if I was to go to school I’d have to force myself to not get any sleep at all. Needless to say I couldn’t cope with it. My life is ruined and I’ve been out of school and jobless for years. Sometimes it seems like it can get better, but then it always takes a spin for the worse again shortly thereafter.I got pretty heavy sleep meds recently but I became addicted and would stay awake high as fuck popping lots of pills, even if my intention was to sleep. It also made it harder for me to wake up.I can’t get out of bed. I’m used to having 50 alarms ringing everyday by now but each time I turn one off I fall asleep while trying to convince myself to get out of bed. I stopped taking my meds. And I thought I was improving a little. Got lots of determination even though little success. My boyfriend has been the most helpful thing in my life. He magically relaxes me and can convince me most times to get up. But we don’t live together and can’t see eachother right now. And even when he turns things around, when I’m home alone I fuck things up right away.**Current situation:** (I need help)This past week I’ve been lucky and proud of myself if I sleep at all during the night. I don’t want to at all. There’s almost no convincing myself. If I do then I’ll have to lie hours in bed and try to relax. But I just can’t go to bed in time which means everytime I do manage to sleep, I lose the next day (or half.)But the hardest part for me to deal with right now is how I really am scared of falling asleep. I’ve been having nightmares every night. The most horrible things you can dream of. I’ve had a lot of nightmares in my life but nothing as disturbing as these. I don’t want to. I’m tired, it’s so late the morning will be here soon enough again. I’m getting flashbacks to my nightmares. I have plans tomorrow that I don’t want to ruin. My brain can come up with hundreds of things it rather be doing. I’m going back and forth trying to choose between sleep or no sleep. I feel like hell is waiting for me to enter, ready to torture me again. But I know how tired I’ll be if I don’t get any rest. What do I do?
Signal	...and give me the false hope that maybe this could work after all, just to let me down again. LMAO sorry sorry, excuse my shitty attempt at being funny. Just trying to make light of this fucking mess. In all seriousness I can't take this anymore. To even begin the process of sleep I have to down 9-12 mg of melatonin and 400 mg of neurontin, and that's still hit or miss. And my mental state is already volatile as all hell (Type 2 Bipolar + ADD), being sleep deprived makes moderation so much harder. I just end up becoming an anxious and irritable mess that's on the fringe of snapping. The only thing that worked for me in the past was taking a few shots + 50 mg benadryl, but that's dangerous af and I'm really trying not to become dependent on meds for something that should come naturally. And whenever I do manage to fall asleep properly, I end up having vivid nightmares or sleep paralysis episodes that jolt me up either screaming or in tears. Also, my body just loves giving me bursts of energy to keep me up when I'm on the cusp of sleep. I don't think I'd mind that too much if I still had cognitive ability, instead I just end up being a hyperactive (and paranoid and anxious) zombie. Anyone else see shadow people when sleep deprived? I keep getting this feeling of someone over my shoulder or breathing down my neck or someone staring/following me. Fuck it I guess, new friends\~ Have any of ya'll tried a hard reset, and did it work? I really need advice because as of right now, I can only ko on the spot if I am both emotionally and physically drained. Idk how long I've been up as of rn, but I think im somewhere around a day and a half. I can't attempt sleep now though, gotta stay up for classes and to finish some work. So, I guess im taking adderall (prescribed), because throwing that into the mix is definitely a good idea! Falling asleep shouldn't be so torturous. My emotional baseline is already a mess, and there's always new shit going on. Whether it be my friends feeling obligated to constantly update me on my ex, my family imploding, or this ridiculous 5x course-load.I'm sorry if this whole rant comes off as incoherent, I can't seem to focus my thoughts. This is the most "normal-like" unstable I have felt in a while. I mean I've gone longer periods of time without sleep, but this has been consistent deprivation. I find myself either randomly breaking out into tears, becoming super giddy, endlessly pacing, becoming extremely self destructive or being assaulted with paranoid and anxious thoughts that only stop once I faint (that's only happened once in recent times though). The most simple fucking things are getting to me right now. I'm not sure why, but I'm freaking out over eating breakfast. Over the fact that I'm hungry and need to eat, but if I eat it'll give me more energy to stay awake, and if I get up to go make breakfast I'll be taking away from my work time, and if I fuck up this assignment I'll fuck over my grade in the class, and if I fuck that up I'll fuck up my chances of getting into grad school, and at that point why the fuck am I even alive then. Idk.&#x200B;Basically I can't take this, please at least let me have sleep. &#x200B;please. 😐
NotSignal	I'm 16 and have never been able to just sleep. I always have to lie there with my eyes closed for at least an hour every night. It's impossible to get my brain to shut off so I can go to sleep. Sometimes I go the whole night having barely slept or not slept at all. Also, when I finally do get to sleep it feels like I haven't slept and I have just lay in the same position the whole night because I don't remember falling asleep or waking up. I thought this was normal for everyone but I Googled why this happens and apparently it is something to do with insomnia and most people actually feel themselves fall asleep and wake up. I'm not sure if I actually have insomnia or anything because I literally just found out that this isn't normal for other people. so could someone let me know if this means I have insomnia or something?
NotSignal	just keep thinking this can't be happening. my life is an absolute nightmare. i dont feel depression but a huge gigantic black void. theres nothing anyone can say or do thatd make me feel better
NotSignal	Any one else have an issue with your teeth feeling loose or sore after staying up for a long time? Some of my teeth get this feeling when I’ve stayed up too long but after sleeping for a few hours they feel fine again. I’m wondering if there’s an explanation to this or if anyone’s experienced this?
Signal	it is 8 am and i’m still awake. over the course of the night I’ve taken 3 unisom, 6 melatonin, 2 valerian capsules, and i’m currently drinking a spiked seltzer. i want to sleep so badly but my body is so anxious. every time i’m about to fall asleep i imagine that i feel an earth quake or my eyes will suddenly burst open and i will be jolted awake. i can literally feel my brain stem buzzing and creaking. i need to get on prescription sleep meds. do i go to my general practice physician or should i book an apt with a psychiatrist as i feel like this problem is mostly anxiety based ? thank you guys
Signal	Husband is 28. Due to covid, and being between jobs at the moment, he stays home all day. He has had issues with minor insomnia in the past, but this past week has been a nightmare. He get at most between 1 and 4 hours of sleep per day, and has at the moment gone over 24 hours with no sleep. We have tried tea, over the counter sleeping pills (no insurance, so can't get prescription), taking advice online to only go into the bedroom when he feels like he could sleep, turning all lights and electronics off, ECT. The thing that is driving him nuts the most is that when he feels like he is falling asleep his body jerks and wakes him back up. He has also been having a lot of nausea and body pains. We're at our wits end right now and any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Signal	Lately I’ve not been able to fall asleep at all. Every time I’m about to doze off I suddenly wake up.. like I can feel my body going into sleep and I just take a breath and wake up. does this happen to anyone else? I’ve never had insomnia so I don’t know how to or what to feel. I also have extreme anxiety and reading about dying from insomnia literally makes me sick to my stomach. Please help. I’ve tried taking melatonin, exercising, warm bath, lavender etc but nothing helps me I feel like I’m dying
Signal	It's been a struggle since around xmas. 3-4 hours most nights, some less and a few days of sleeping 6-7 hours during the day out of pure exhaustion.I thought I was getting on track. I saw my acupuncturist this evening and had a good session. I fell asleep for maybe 10 mint there and then got another 45 in bed before I woke up and now I'm wired. It's 3:51am and my alarm is set for 9 minutes from now for an early morning flight to start three days of a work conference, which will be 14 hour days, no flexibility in structure and I really need to bring my A game. I'm dreading this.
NotSignal	I'm 11, and I cannot sleep any night. I go to bed at about 11 then I close my eyes and two hours later I'm still awake. It's 4:31 right now and all Im doing is crying in bed. I don't want to spend my summer like this is there anything I can do
NotSignal	Hey guys,Would really appreciate you guy's help on diagnosing my sleep issue.History: I'm 25, male, eat healthy and exercise thrice a week. I need \~ 7h15 mins to be optimal. For most of my life, if I have problem sleeping, it's with falling asleep. Once asleep, I am quite a heavy sleeper.In the past one month plus, I've started to wake up almost every night after 3.5 hours of sleep. I can go back to sleep with maybe 40% success rate, and if I succeed, I usually get my 7h15 mins. Else, I usually have to work from 3.30am to about 9.30am to feel sleep pressure again and nap for about 2 hours. Sometimes, I sort of build up sleep deprivation, and if I really lacked sleep from the previous day, I can then sleep straight for 7h15 mins, but it's really the exception. I've been following the below recently:\- Stop drinking 3 hours before bed. When I wake now, don't really feel a strong urge to pee (works)\- Stop eating 4 hours before bed.\- Meditation, stress reduction\- flux at night\- Tape my mouth to prevent dry mouth (works)When I wake up, even when I'm calm, I don't manage to fall back asleep. I've eliminated so many reasons, these are the last candidates I have:\- Finasteride, which I take every other day at 0.25mg. However, the last time I took finasteride, I actually had zero problems sleeping. My first week on Fin, I slept 8-9 hours straight every night (up from 6.5 hours), and had even ability to take mid day nap. But my sleep is equally shit on days where I take and don't take finasteride.\- I'm a natural biphasic sleeper. But I doubt it. I've never in my life faced the problem of maintaining sleep\- Depression but I don't know it?\- Anxiety from one to two months ago, causing me to have this problem, until my cicadian rhythm readjusted to biphasic sleep\- I live in a country right at the equator, in a high rise building. I returned home 5 months ago from living 4 years in California, and it's about 7-8 degrees celsius warmer in this country. When I returned, it was colder due to excess rains. Recently, the nights have become hotter, I make my fan 2x faster. I doubt this is a sufficient problem though.What the fuck is going on? Can't fucking fix this.
NotSignal	Hey guys it’s been 3 months since I last posted on this page. Since then my sleep has been mostly normal. But all of a sudden today I’ve had the worst no sleep day of my life. It’s 6:30 am and I just don’t feel sleepy at all. What could be the reason for this, I’m thinking of taking a melatonin but I’m scared that if it doesn’t work it’ll just trigger my anxiety more.Any help is appreciated
NotSignal	I am 32 years, male. Healthy. No chronic diseases. Perfect bloodwork. Have no problems falling asleep. In 5-10 mins after I put my head on the pillow I am out. Previously all my life I was getting 7 to 8.5 hours of sleep straight each night easily. But in the past 2-3 months I always wake up after 3 to 5 hours of sleep at the most if I am lucky. Very very rarely I manage to get 5.5 to 6 hours of sleep afer waking up 1-2 times and somehow managing to fall asleep again. Now my eyes are baggy and visibly aged in just a few months. The usual scenario is I go to bed @ 00:00 and wake up at 5:00. Or 5:30. If I go to bed early @ 22:00 then I wake up at 2:30 - 3am. If I go to bed @ 23:00 then 4:00-4:30 is the usual wake up time. Tried several strategies - stayed until exhaustion after sleepless nights and again I wake up after 4-5 hours of sleep. Training in the morning, training before sleep. Eating low carb/keto, eating carbs before sleep, eating honey before bed to raise blood sugar. Lowered the amount of EMF by removing the router, switching off the phones. Cold temp in the room, darkness etc etc.Now, in order not to age super quickly I try to catch naps during the day whenever I can. I wake up @ 4-5am, and then if I can I get another 1.5 , 2 hours of sleep during the day especially during the weekends I do it. I think this is counterproductive for the nights sleep but better than just 4-5 hours of sleep each night ?Last night I fell asleep early @ 21:30, woke up @ 00:30. Fell asleep again @ 3:00 and woke up @ 6:00. Because of the coronavirus and no work I was able to go to sleep after breakfast @ 11:30 and slept the longest time until 14:30. So I got 3 sessions of sleep for a whole 9 hours of sleep. But this cannot be achieved if I have work to do.What is going on here ? Cant stay asleep for more than 3 hours. If I am lucky I might get 5 hours. From all research I saw 7 hours is the minimum for health reasons and 8 is the best to slow down aging and stuff.Any help, information and suggestions would be appreciated !
NotSignal	Just a shitpost really, but it's kind of disconcerting that Reddit brought me hereI'm not an insomniac, I'm just sleepless for a day or two at a time
Signal	Over the past two months, i have become a shell of a person. I can barely walk, stay upright, short term memory does not exists, eyesight is blurry, muscles jerk and have atrophied, understanding speech and talking have become very tedious, im housebound or bedbound depending on the time, and the neurologist I have knows its serious but because of how the health care system and appointments work im left in the dark to wait, but each day things get worse. Ive tried countless types of medication, from benzos, ssris, more basic meds like melatonin / benadryl, belsomra, seroquel, and so on with no success. Ive done everything I could for my sleep hygiene and natural remedies for healing insomnia. Currently I get absolutely no sleep, or pass out for about an hour or so because of the medications i take, but havent gotten restorative sleep in over a month. I no longer have a sense of time or can feel temperature, physical fatigue is completely overwhelming. The neurological issues are definitely the worst, but physical dont help of course either. The neurologist wants an mri, molecular tests, and even though it might not be helpful as im not sleeping, but a sleep study. I am deteriorating and fading away. Im no longer who i was.
NotSignal	Didn't know where to post this, but I thought this would be an appropriate /. So this morning I woke up remembering that I had a dream that I walked up to the window at some point during the night, opened the curtains and saw an extreme amount of snow coming down. I was so surprised cause it hasn't snowed all winter, and usually it does around here, so it was a happy/relieved surprise. It covered all the cars in the street, the rooftops and even the road itself.I really thought it was just a dream, but I also wondered how I could've even dreamt when I smoked weed like regularly? (I smoke every time before bed and never remember any of my dreams, but the few times I don't smoke I dream very heavily, mostly nightmares, and remember most details.)And then, late in the afternoon, I was watching the news with my dad and saw that it SNOWED this night in some places in the Netherlands.This made me wonder if was sleepwalking this night, or did I just dream? I've never sleepwalked before and I feel kinda confused about it.
Signal	I became immune to seroquel, unless at extremely high doses (which I don't want) and have an awful reaction to trazadone. I depend on psychiatric medication to sleep. But I really want to replace a high dose antipsychotic with something else, without any severe side effects such as weight gain or sexual side effects. I know ambien and lunesta and stuff like that isn't to be taken every night. Is there anything out there for me?? Thank you
NotSignal	It doesn't matter if I go to sleep at 10PM or 3AM, I'll always wake up at 4AM and won't be able to sleep later. I have started to make breakfast at 5AM, because there's no point to keep trying to go to sleep.
Signal	I use zopiclone but still it only give me like 1-2 hours. I pass out nicely but just wake up and lay there. I keep taking it because it at least makes me sleep a bit and relaxes me. Anyone else like this ?
NotSignal	About once or twice a week, I lie in bed until 2 AM, unable to fall asleep. Sometimes I grab a bottle of vodka and start drinking until I drift off, but I don't like to do this often because it's a bad habit. It works, though. But the other 5 days a week, I sleep well. Every night I'm in bed by 11 and I fall asleep within a few minutes. Sometimes I can go a few weeks or longer without a sleepless night. Anyone else have these occasional bouts of insomnia?
Signal	It’s currently 4:07 AM right now. Pretty tired but can’t fall asleep for shit. Have class at 12 PM so by the time I’ll be able to fall asleep I’ll have gotten 4 hours of sleep. Need a psychiatrist to prescribe me Ativan, xanax, or even ambien because mirtazapine didn’t work for me. Oh well.
NotSignal	I think i forgot how to sleep, i cant fall asleep until the sun comes out, im tired, in drained, i cant stop thinking i want this to stop i just want to sleep
Signal	So I have an awesome GP who is having me try stuff I haven't along with giving me emergency doses of what I know has. I could have nearly cried that she recognized my history of medication could look a bit drug-seekery but waved it away with "insomnia is a valid reason to take what you need."So she's started me on Lunesta. Ambien and Lunesta don't give me any bad side effects except just knocking me out for only a short period of time.Lunesta definitely knocked me out for longer but it didn't do anything to me at the 1 mg (in 30 tab) dose she gave me. I knew to take it on an empty stomach and took it 5 hrs after my last meal (just a sandwich so not a whole lot).I had to take another dose to finally get the "fast so sleep, you dont remember falling asleep" effect.Im going to call her to ask about this. Does anyone have any personal experience with a higher max dose of Lunesta allowed to you? I don't weigh a whole lot (68 kilos) but it's always takes a high dose of stuff to even start to effect me
NotSignal	So, since this Tuesday I'm having issues with maintaining the sleep. Like, I'm able to fall asleep pretty easily but I wake up 3-5 hours later and I can't go back to sleep again. This has never happened before. Although there is a fact that may be the cause of this issue. I start going to college on Monday, and tuesday was the day that I've came to know about this. And since then, my sleep is a bloody mess.What I wanted to ask you guys is if I should worry about this. If this may be the start of a serious insomnia or is it just because I'm pretty eager and stuff. Has this ever happened to anyone of you? Thanks for reading :)
NotSignal	I have this struggle with always loosing sleep at 2:45AM, Every night i wake up in the middle of the night super tired at that specific time and can't get back to sleep till the morning. Now the stranger thing is: If i slept before 1am I'll have this problem, but if i went to bed after 1AM I sleep like a baby and get my 7 hours or more. Which is kinda hard cause whenever i want to sleep well i have to wait till 1AM of more to get a goodnight sleep Who also has this problem
Signal	so for over a week i can’t sleep until atleast as a general rule-i feel tired but can’t sleep and when i try it takes a couple hours to fall asleep-i have a bunch of anxiety over sleep like i always have but it’s never been this bad to the point where my heart starts beating faster and i get like a burst of energy when ever i try to sleep and i have this anxiety over peeing where i make myself go like a bunch of times unnecessarily and when i try to sleep all i can think ab is do u need to pee abd if i don’t i’ll make myself need to and then i’ll go -and i get really stressed when i can’t sleep like i start panicking really badly and start crying for no reason-sorry if this sounds rlly weird lmao
Signal	I pretty much always start my period at the end of the month and I've noticed that around a week before I have trouble sleeping. It's 5:30 am right now and I have just pulled an all nighter. I felt really hyper for no reason at around midnight but began getting more anxious as time went on. I also have a cough which my anxiety is telling me is more than just a cough which didn't help either. It's amazing how short hours are when you're anxious.I'm trying not to let it bother me. I don't have school this week so I don't really have anything important to attend to. I just hate the feeling of missing out on a nights sleep. The tablet I took didn't really help either. I just wish I had some chewing gum (chewing gum always helps me calm down, for some reason). I actually feel so much better writing this post. I feel like I've kinda got it out of my system. I guess that's what they mean when they say your should keep a diary of your worries or whatever.For those of you that are reading this I wish you a good and peaceful night's rest because you deserve it.
NotSignal	Basically title, haven’t gotten around to trying it but I see it in store aisles all the time. Have had trouble sleeping since I could remember honestly (18 currently) and I sort of just want to feel rested if it’s even possible at this point lmao. Would appreciate any feedback on this/recommendations for other products or methods that work well. Thanks in advance!
Signal	This has been happening for weeks now I really don’t like we’re thing are going I can sleep when I take magnesium but I always overdose so imma drop it
NotSignal	Okay. So I have had periodic insomnia all my life, usually triggered by things going on in my life. There are very many ways to go about getting your sleep back on track but they don't always work. I tend to just keep trying different things until they work. I'll list the techniques in order of how quickly you can impliment them. 1. If you can stay perfectly still for 15 minutes, your body will automatically fall asleep. Sounds easy, but you can't give in to any itches or shifting your weight slightly. Tiny little things like that are your body's way of checking if you are still awake - DO NOT GIVE INTO THEM! It can feel uncomfortable for the first few minutes, but if you can hold out, it works 100%. I like counting backwards from 1000 (15mins in seconds) and focus on that rather than my body.2. Counting backwards helps me focus my mind. Counting backwards requires more focus than counting forwards (a bit like the alphabet) and I have yet to reach zero before I fall asleep. If your mind wonders and you loose your place, just start again.300 seconds = 5mins600 seconds = 10 mins1000 seconds = just over 15 mins.I like to use one of these as my starting point, depending on how tired I am.3. If your issue is waking up in the middle of the night, then follow these rules:- resist opening your eyes or checking your phone. If you pretend to still be asleep, chances are you soon will be.- if you still can't sleep, get up and go into another room. Try activates like reading a book or doing a puzzle. Try not to use phones/tablets/TV. Listening to something soothing while you're doing this also helps.- drinking water is fine but other drinks can get your metabolism going and make it hards to get back to sleep. If you're absolutely starving hungry, try a banana. They are a slow releasing food and don't require any prep.4. If you're trying to get to sleep or have woken up in the night, listening to something often helps. It doesn't need to be a special sleep soundtrack or podcast, although those can be helpful. Pick something you enjoy, something familiar, something that doesn't require too much focus. I use Harry Potter audio books because Stephen Fry's voice is so calming. If you listen to the same thing every time you try to go to sleep, your body will soon recognise it and begin to go to sleep automatically. 5. If you are worried about school or work or anything that you need to do - GO DO IT! You might as well since you're awake and at least you won't have to worry about it tomorrow night. 6. Build a bedtime routine. This sounds easier than it is, but if you can build in a specific set of actions then when you start doing them, your body will soon recognise it and begin to go to sleep automatically.My routine: -Put on audio book -wash face with warm water-wash face with cold water -apply lavender face cream-make and drink warm milk and honey-put on pyjamas -go to bed7. Try going to bed and getting up at the same time every day. Identify how many hours of sleep you need and work around that. This is something that I really struggle to implement but works brilliantly if I have enough self discipline. Most of important of all - DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP!Stress in enemy number 1 to sleep. If you can't sleep, it's okay. It feels like shit but you'll get through it and this bout of insomnia will break.You are good enough, you are loved and you will accomplish great things - even if sleeping isn't one of them 😂
NotSignal	Last time I slept was probably about 32 hours ago. I found a really cool & interesting roleplaying game on my phone that I ended up spending the whole night on and now it's 8:30 in the morning, whoopeeee. Gonna take a cold shower & grab a large iced coffee from Dunkin and see if I can't soldier through the rest of the day. Insomnia and ADHD don't mix well.
NotSignal	Benzodiazepines can solve sleep disruptions at least for me but we’d build tolerance over time and need more of it in the longterm.
NotSignal	15mg Mirtazipine / Remeron a night is life saving.Could I drop it to 7.5mg and still get the same sedative effect? 15 is great just wondering if less is more? Thanks
NotSignal	I haven’t slept in a week, to be honest, I feel okay, I can perform at over 50% however, my anxiety levels are through the roof and my heart isn’t feeling good. Its Sunday and doctor offices are closed so i’m wondering if I should head to the ER. This is my worst case of insomnia yet.
NotSignal	SLEEP MAINTENANCE PEOPLE: 1. Did moving your usual sleeping location such as sleeping in another bed/room help? Or did it quickly revert back.2) What are some strategies that have worked in making you fall back to sleep upon waking up in the middle of night or prematurely? 3) Any strategies you employ in the day or leading up to the bed-time? Personally for me, I try to keep a good mind about it (cognitively) and try not to let it affect me mentally as much, but sometimes I do feel there is an unconscious thought in negatively associating sleep with the maintenace issue and then your body keeps waking up.
NotSignal	I like the sleep it helps me get but the taste does not go away at night or the next day. Water tastes awful and I typically love water. I don’t want to quit taking it over this...
Signal	Firstly, I'm so thankful this community exists. People around me are trying to be supportive and I love them for it, but no one really understands what I'm going through. I only feel understood here.I've always been a troubled sleeper but it was never anything major, never anything more than a couple of nights here and there. Also, I don't have anxiety or other similar issues (at least I think so). My personal hell started 4 months ago, I started a new job (1st real one, I had an internship before but was able to come in later in the morning so it didn't pose a problem). The new job had alternating shifts (morning/afternoon) and before every morning shits (so app 3 times a week) I had serious trouble sleeping night before the morning shifts, where I basically had zero sleep, and with the help of pills maybe an hour max. It drained me!Fast forward to 10 days ago, since then I have not had a single night of normal sleep, more than 2 hours tops. I've tried everything and trust me I mean everything, all the pharmacological and non pharm methods. I go to bed always at the same time (11pm), read for 30 min before, soothing tea, lavander oil, cooler room, melatonin, magnesium,cuddling, whatever... I also started a sleep journal but looking at it just makes me want to kms. After 2 or so hours of trying I give in and take zolpidem 10mg or lorazepam 2mg or if I'm really desperate and only have a few hours midazolam 7.5mg. With that I maybe get a restless hour of light sleep or so. I don't want to become dependent on them. I'm so sleep deprived that I cry whenever some asks me how I'm doing, I got inflammatory problems with my left eye, GI issues, skin issues, I lost a 4kg since then (and I kad BMI 20 to start with) plus a lot more. I look half dead. My fiancé and I want kids in a next couple of years and this insomnia and pregnancy combination terrifies me. Just to mention that I'm a medical doctor and trust me when I say that I really tried to resolve this issue myself, but I think I need help, even though I'm unsure if it'll work. At this point I just want someone to sedate me and leave me for a couple of days, as unrealistic as it sounds. Today I tried making an appointment with a sleep specialist, wish me luck. Sorry for the long post and probably numerous spelling mistakes.
NotSignal	I had a bad couple months of sleep, and i am finally starting to sleep better! I still have brain fog and fatigue from not sleeping in those months, how long did it take you guys to start feeling back to normal after sleeping normally? Thanks! (I've heard some people take months..)
Signal	Sooo i think i have a sleep disorder cuz i need like an hour at least to fall asleep. I sleep very lightly and anything wakes me up. I can sleep for 12hours straight and i feel more tired than before going to sleep. I am always tired. Anyone have an idea what it could be?
NotSignal	I can sleep in easily most of the time and mostly sleep a normal amount of sleep (7-9 hours) and sometimes (about 1-2 times a week) i wake up super early like 4-6am.But EVERY. SINGLE. DAY., I wake up after having super vivid, intense, weird, chaotic dreams, often nightmares, not with monsters but with super stressful/scary real life situations and almost always I'm super reliefed it was just a dream and everything is ok now. I am then super groggy, have headaches, bad memory, confused, no attention, no motivation, just completely shitty brain function all day long, although it does gradually get better as the day progresses. The headaches/shitty head feeling is often so bad that I just want to smash my head against my wall. Hitting my own head or smashing my head against the wall actually feels good, like a massage, idk wtf's going on lol. This happens EVERY SINGLE DAY, no exception, for like 2 months now and I'm so fucking sick of it. I can't accomplish anything at all, wtf is going on here?Is this just normal insomnia or a special condition?
Signal	My girlfriend has chronic sleeping problems for 2 years. She often has trouble falling asleep until 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning. She always feels tired and potentially depressed because of the constant sleep deprivation and stress in the family. We are currently not in the same city so I am very worried about her.She saw the doctors but they only gave her sleeping pills. She doesn’t want to get used to taking the pills, but nothing else works.A lot of people suggest to create a strict sleeping schedule. I thought it is a good method, but the fact that she simply can’t fall asleep makes this method a bit paradoxical (how can she stick to it if she can’t fall asleep)? It would really help if people in this sub can give me insights or experience about how to alleviate the sleeping problem.
NotSignal	Usually I can’t sleep because I jump up breathing hard (I think anxiety causes this), but the last 3 nights, I felt like my brain was in pain every time I was dozing off, and I would jump up. I kept having micro sleeps for hours. I’m not sure if these were dreams, but I felt like I was visualizing my room and surroundings (but didn’t feel awake) and at times felt like the lights were on(when they weren’t). I’ve had insomnia for 8 months, but these last 3 nights were extremely scary because of how much my head hurt when trying to sleep. Has this happened to anyone?
Signal	So my body is really falling apart.Haven't slept for longTest show red and white blood cells in bladderAlso monoStill can't sleep.Have meds dont work. Sleeping pills eats.Dying.This is what happen when a tongue piercing ges really wrong.So much pain
NotSignal	Wtf am i supposed to do till 3 am? I'm not allowed in electronics after 9pm (I'm 14).I'm tired of thinking about stuff.
Signal	so I currently work from 10pm to 6am. usually ready to sleep by 8am. but no matter how tired I am, I still toss and turn for hours. and even still can't get a solid sleep when it finally happens. I wear an eye mask to darken the sunlight. sometimes ear plugs to drown out the family downstairs. tried taking meletonin and even the occasional Xanax I have for my anxiety. I know it's not an ideal sleep situation to start. I was thinking about getting some sleeping pills from my Dr. any recommendations or advice? will the sleeping pills even help my situation?
NotSignal	Anyone else smoke a lot of weed as a teenager and now can no longer sleep? If so is this going to forever or can you overcome this by stopping smoking?
NotSignal	I drunk an average amount of alcohol on Friday, enough to get decently drunk but I'm quite big, so I was fine. Since then I havent been able to sleep at all and I've also been feeling paranoid at nights from playing Until Dawn. I usually exercise in the evenings to tire myself out and normally have good sleep hygiene. How long will this last?
Signal	I used to have a hard time getting to sleep. I wouldn't say I had insomnia as I really don't know it could have just me having adhd and constantly thinking too much. I ended up finding that meditation helps me sleep.More important than meditation however was my discovery of magnesium. This stuff helps relax your muscles and body. Not only that however it also increases natural melatonin production. Why is this better than just taking melatonin? Because when you take melatonin over long periods of time (I don't know how long that would entail or how much/often you would need to use for this to happen) it decreases your natural melatonin production. This leads you to rely more heavily on the melatonin tablets and makes it harder to fall asleep without them. I hope I helped anyone get to sleep better. And as a plus it makes dream recall increase as well as making them more vivid.Tl;Dr magnesium relaxes you and increases melatonin production. Melatonin decreases melatonin production.
NotSignal	Buying a new one and torn between the above 3. Open to any suggestions. I use to have a memory foam mattress and felt I got better sleep with it, but the heat issue made falling asleep even tougher. I've read hyphen is a good "hybrid" foam infused with copper coils to help cooling. I've also heard good things about Purple and Nectar. I want the opinions of some fellow insomniacs though before buying.
Signal	I’d like to make this post for all those who are currently going through or will go through intense anxiety with insomnia. I am currently getting over one of my insomnia spouts and I have been noticing myself having intense anxiety. However, I heard some advice about anxiety, which is that it is helpful to think of anxiety as an independent occurrence. At least for me, a big part of my anxiety is thinking that my anxiety is caused by my insomnia, and thinking that anxiety and insomnia are two things that cannot be separated. Just know that they can. It is possible for you to be sleep deprived and to not be intensely anxious. When you think of it this way, it is surprising how much better you feel. So, remember that you are Judy anxious, you are not anxious because of your insomnia.
NotSignal	So I closed my eyes at about 7:30am and then looked at the time and it was already 1:00pm. I don't even know if I slept or not. It felt like I was awake the whole time but time went way to fast that I think I might've slept, I'm so confused. Does anybody else have this problem?
NotSignal	Currently I’m having 9 hours of sleep one night but the next night I don’t sleep at all. Not too sure why this happens but it’s beginning to take a toll on my mental health so any help would be much appreciated. Thank you
Signal	My dreams of “being an awful person,” aka my irrational fears from anxiety just woke me up. Again. This happens literally every night. Sometimes it takes half an hour for me to wake up, other times a split second out of bed sweating. I don’t remember what happened tonight but I feel that emotion and it’s infuriating because I can’t pinpoint what makes me angry, and that makes me uncomfortable. I’ve found that relaxing my overall anxiety throughout the day helps a bit, and I’m even on some drowsy/anti anxiety medication. This has been going on for several months now. Somehow I’m still waking up after 1 1/2 / 2 hours though so it hasn’t helped very much. I just want to sleep good every night and not ask the “Why am I alive who am I what is my purpose will anything ever change will I ever get my old life back” questions until the sun comes up. My sleep looks like: stay up until 12 trying to fall asleep since 2-3 hours prior, wake up at 1:30-2am, have a wave of anxiety hit you and sweat the bed/sit on the toilet, come back and question your life and think about how much you want to sleep for several hours whilst fighting heavy nausea from not sleeping, and then wake up at around 12-2pm from having been up all night against my will. How do I break this cycle?
NotSignal	It’s been a bit since I’ve posted in this subreddit but I figured I’d give it a shot again.I’ve been writing scenarios to pass the time, though I just started on Prozac for my anxiety and it perks me up without letting me sleep, I’m probably going to start taking it in the morning just so I can get to sleep.Thanks for readingMy little rantI appreciate it a lot ❤️
NotSignal	I took one yesterday and was able to sleep easier, my parents told me I literally slept like almost instantly
Signal	Hey all ever since I came off preventive medication for my migraines i’ve had insomnia. I tried natural methods, sleeping tablets besides stilnox yet no luck. I wake up every 2-3 hours and it takes long time to sleep. I currently see a neurologist, Psychologist to manage my migraines. Anxiety and all managed by my Psych now my question is has anyone found a psychiatrist helpful to figure out if meds for your sleep can help or what steps to take? I also should state I don’t have any daily medication or am on anti depressants. Any ideas or experiences would be helpful!
NotSignal	That was the weirdest night of my life I felt awake the entire time and had very vivid dreams where I have talked to people yet felt my body very confusing night
NotSignal	Just a question out of curiosityI’ve heard you can have psychotic episodes but I’m not sure if you can get condition from severe insomnia
Signal	My insomnia began in my childhood due to trauma and my mother going full manic and constantly pulling me out of bed at night. In addition, I have autoimmune problems that caused malnutrition and have had RLS since I was a little girl. I also get shifts in my insomnia based on my cycle (total insomnia right before my period starts). So yes, that's RLS, PTSD, and hormonal changes. I slept really well in my mid 20s until several deaths in the family and close deaths. I also started getting worse cystic acne at this point that appears to be hormonal, so I'm thinking something might have changed internally.I worked with psychiatrists for two years and was on Klonopin for that time. However, I kept asking if we could try new things or possibly pair another medication as Klonopin would relax me but not always help me sleep.The psychiatrists typically were resistant to letting me try much else other than Klonopin. Just trazadone and seroquel, both of which caused horrible side effects. I felt that most of my psychiatrists (3 in two years) got frustrated if I wasn't happy just to show up, get my Klonopin, and leave.I started working with GPs this year and had the opportunity to take Lunesta--which actually put me out super fast like no other medication has done well.However, I'm still having problems with RLS, my sleep cycle being short even on Lunesta based on my cycle, and so forth. My GP seems frustrated with me that one medication alone doesn't solve it all. She made the comment that I'm too young (30) to be having severe insomnia and she also commented that I'm on a lot of medications. (She prescribed me short terms of different medications, most of which I called her office to let her know that I was having a bad reaction to. I'm only taking one med right now.)So I'm frustrated, and I'm frustrated that she's frustrated. She's been the most flexible doctor I've had so far and I'm still feeling like something's missing.
NotSignal	My usual sleep cycle was perfectly normal. I would sleep from about 04:00 to 12:00 - 14:00. Because it is currently my school holiday, I didn't really care about the strange times. I recently tried to sort out my cycle by staying awake until my optimal bedtime. I have now been awake for 36 hours and I have no idea what started this, and of course I have no idea how to end it. The sudden strain, with the tiredness has already had me crying over it. How did this happen?
Signal	for anyone who takes trazodone for insomnia, i was prescribed 50mg for my issue of staying asleep (rather than falling asleep)i took it for the first time last night and still woke up in the night like normal. is this normal? would it have worked right away it was going to work for me?
Signal	So my depression/anxiety has been aggressive these past few months and because I don't go back to university until september my sleeping pattern has become outrageous. Yesterday (or was it the day before yesterday? Days blend into one) I finally fell asleep at 11am. Slept all the way through until 8pm. Its bad, I know its bad, but this is what happens when I come back home. I become nocturnal or don't sleep at all. So now its 5am and I woke up at 8pm last night - I'm not tired whatsoever so I'm going to attempt to stay awake for 24 hours. Im a film student so I'm just going to watch a shit load of films and try to make it until tomorrow evening. Is anyone in a similar situation to make me feel less alone?
Signal	I just toss and turn....if I go to bed at like 9pm I’ll be asleep at around 3 am. It takes me that long. Lately my head has full of trillions of thoughts it seems like and it’s been hella hard to study, because I’m not getting enough sleep. For a while I’ve been knocking out at 5 or 6 am and waking up at like 2 pm. Melatonin doesn’t help. I do have a bad coffee habit but I literally cannot let go of the coffee. Idk. I just want to stop putting off things I need to do because I’m too tired to do them :/
NotSignal	(I don't know if it is the right place to ask the question but) I cannot go back to sleep if I sleep a few hours before I wake up. Do you have any suggestions? I try deep breaths and it helped a bit but when I was going back to sleep I just woke myself up. Does any of you know what to do in those situations?
Signal	How do you all deal with sleep anxiety? I dread going to bed because I get so anxious. I worry both that I won’t be able to fall asleep (my insomnia used to be much worse than it is now) and I can’t sleep because I’m worrying too much. It feels like an endless cycle. Probably not the most succinct way to describe this. How do yall deal with this? any tips would be appreciated :)
Signal	In the recent days it got worse and I'm having sleep anxiety again now. And the worst thing is, I can't do anything about it. They are drilling again from around 8:30 am to 5-6 pm and its so loud nobody could sleep in this noise (earplugs not enough!). And they have been doing this for 3 weeks.BUT actually, different neighbours keep taking turns and have been doing this since november with 1-2 week breaks, so this is happening almost every day. Sometimes it's not that loud and I can sleep, sometimes it's too loud. You never know, it's like a gambling game!I could tolerate this extremely well until this point (despite having general, social anxiety and ruminating problems) but today is the breaking point.How am I supposed to even try when every single morning someone is drilling? And if finally someone stops, another neighbour literally starts doing it again?I'm furious at this point and I'm sleepy as hell but I know if I try to sleep now, by the time I'd fall asleep they will just drill again.
NotSignal	Hi. I have a sleep problems for few years, is there any medicine that won't make me zombie that doesn't feel emotions, can be use for long term, and without increasing dosage by time? I currently trying mianserin, but it makes me a little bit zombie. It can increase appetite, make me sleepy a little bit during the day, I just doesn't care about that, it least important, trying to sleep for two, three hours, spinning in bed is just horrible.
NotSignal	It works wonders but I hate hate hate taking it so often! I feel like shit in the morning and I wish I had taken it earlier tonihjt. Tonigjt was off to such a good start too, in bed at 9:30 reading till 10:30 out by 11 and woke up at midnight. Of course I had to get up and pee because I always do. I cut myself off from water by 6 pm and only allow 8 oz from 6-bed but I still end up peeing every half hour anyway. That and a mixture of sleep related anxiety. I’m so sick of this shit. I have a 3 yr old and my bf goes to work in the morning so I HAVE to get sleeo and be up without sleep I’m in a terrible mood and feel like a terrible mom
Signal	Please help, does anyone know why I’m unable to sleep for any longer. I can’t fall asleep anytime before 6am and I wake up at 9am even if I dont have an alarm set.
Signal	So I take Zoloft and it’s known to cause vivid dreams. I was on it years ago, then was on Lexapro and now back to Zoloft. It’s been great, my mood is awesome but my sleep has been the worst. It’s not making me too depressed because of the Zoloft. I have vivid dreams I can’t seem to wake up from and if I don’t set an alarm I can sleep for 10 hours straight and have a string of very vivid dreams. I wake up so tired because I was probably moving around, talking, and using energy when my body is supposed to rest. Anyone have this problem?
Signal	For the past year, I’ve struggled with insomnia and anxiety, and I’ve traded off between taking NyQuil and melatonin each night to help me “get tired”. Right now, I feel like I can’t fall asleep without taking one of them, but this week they haven’t worked. Any suggestions for what to take to help get sleepy and feel less anxious? Or, ways to make yourself naturally sleepy and help with anxiety?
Signal	Every single night I have insomnia and wake up with terrible headaches because of it. The less I sleep, the more headache I have when I wake up. It sucks so much I’m having to take dypirone two times a day every single day. Insomnia is horrible on its own but now with a bonus headache... gosh, it’s extremely annoying!!
NotSignal	I didn't sleep at all last night. I went to bed at 11 pm and stayed in bed awake until 7 am. I tried to relax and close my eyes in the hope that sleep would come but it didn't. I've been suffering from insomnia since last week but at least I could still get 4 hours of sleep in the early hours of the morning. I fear that my insomnia is getting worse. I've booked an appointment with my gp tomorrow.
NotSignal	i’ve had my fair share of sleep issues my whole life, but i’m confused about what happened last night. i’ve never had sleep paralysis so i kinda developed a phobia of ever getting it (very likely for me - i have bipolar 2 and other issues, 24 years old), but i’m not sure if i possibly experienced it last night? you tell me.... i “fell asleep” at 1am.. or at least i thought i was.. then i felt like i woke up like an hour later but when i woke up i like could not make sense of my surroundings for MINUTES, like i wasn’t just confused but i was also really frightened. i’ve been going through a bad mixed episode lately so my mind has been really messed up lately (so vivid and fast yet so stagnant and confusing......?) so when i woke up i had all those types of thought processes/feelings but much more intensely. i was able to move my body so i wasn’t paralyzed, so i know it wasn’t sleep paralysis but idk what else to call it. anyways the most disturbing thing was that when i woke up i could recall seeing myself as i was asleep. like i could actually picture what i looked like. i disassociate a lot as i’m awake, so it was the same concept but for the first time i was... asleep??? and after i woke up i realized i was never even actually asleep? it doesn’t make sense but i felt like my mind was kinda like tricked to think it was asleep yet my physical body was like elsewhere and fully cognizant? so then when i “woke up” it was like my two presences came together and were like yo... what the f*ck just happened.. LMAO. it wasn’t a dream. i know how my dreams are, and this was more of an experience than a dream. like at this point i’m assuming there’s no real name for this. has this ever happened to any of you?? am i just losing my mind more and more everyday ???
Signal	Haven't slept for two days and last time I did it only lasted five hours. Tried sleeping right now but when I was about to fall asleep I woke up and had a panic attack for whatever reason.Just fucking kill me already.
Signal	Before this week, I usually went to sleep sometime between 11 and 12, maybe a bit later. Then I would wake up at 10 having fallen asleep within an hour or so. (This is during the past months of quarantine.) Then starting last Monday I wasn't able to actually sleep until 2 or 3 am. I've since begun adjusting my schedule to wake up at 8 or a little after 9 and go to bed at 11 (a little earlier than normal.) However I cannot find myself even confronting the idea of sleeping until 2, 3 or even 4 am now. Before that I would feel anxiety and my heart would beat overly fast for a while, and I would get up and walk around and continue feeling both tired and jittery. How do I adjust my sleep so I am able to not lay in bed for 3-5 hrs before sleep kicks in? Should I be going to sleep later? This hasn't been a problem before at all, even last summer when I would constantly sleep at 12 and wake up/get up at 11:30. Now, however, things are starting to get weird for some reason. What would you suggest I do? Podcasts don't work for me and I'm not good at keeping up with sleep tactics to induce sleep. Suggestions? I know its summer but I do not want this to continue going on when college starts in the fall.
NotSignal	I haven’t slept more than 3 hours a night in the last two weeks. Sometimes I’ll go to the bathroom at night and when I look in the mirror I don’t recognize my own face. Not like my features are different, but like I literally don’t know who that person is. Then I snap out of it. Depersonalization I guess? It’s unsettling. Does anyone else get this?
NotSignal	This is purely anecdotal, but it seems there's more activity then normal on this sub. What do you think? Is it the full moon that's coming, is it all the horribleness in the news lately, or something else? Or am I crazy?P.S. I'm in the same boat.
Signal	Has anyone found that treating the underlying anxiety and depression with an SSRI helped their insomnia? My insomnia is anxiety induced and now I have anxiety about insomnia. Considering an SSRI
NotSignal	Its the second time of the week that this is happening. I struggle to even get an hour of sleep. And thinking that 3 months ago i was a good sleeper... I feel like my life is ending. Idk what to do.
Signal	I may be tired out of my mind with the inability to just sleep. My sleep routines are fucked, in fact i don’t have one. My biggest concern is my sleep anxiety. I was recently framed for something i didn’t do and lost many friends due to it. It’s hard to sleep at night knowing someone coerced amazing friends into believing i’m some monster. What can i do to just shut my brain off? TLDR; how do i turn my brain off?
Signal	I’ve struggled with insomnia as a result of OCD since I was a kid and gradually I grew out of it and honestly did not have any issue sleeping at all. Lockdown has honestly fucked everything up and I didn’t sleep at all a couple night ago and now I feel as though I can’t get through a day without worrying about sleeping that night. Anyone else feel like this? Like they can’t stop thinking about it throughout the day? Any suggestions to stop this vicious cycle?
NotSignal	Hey I am just starting CBTi to address my insomnia and was wondering if anyone on here was at the same point and wanted to support each other through it etc. Always nice to know someone else is dealing with the same issues as you!
Signal	My entire family can fall asleep whenever they want and fast too and yet here i am, the only one with insomnia. falling asleep is truly a FIGHT every single night and i’m getting tired and frustrated off it. it makes me feel so hopeless and out of control.
NotSignal	The only good thing about this insomnia right now is that I have a puppy that does not wanna sleep I can care for lol trying to tire him out makes me tired. Dogs are great
Signal	So I am a chronic insomniac. I have had it for 14+ years. Lately it’s getting worse and really taking a toll. I have slept less than 3 hours a night for about a week. I am starting to notice extensive side effects; I’m cranky, stressed, depressed, anxious, in pain, and over all just ugh. I have mental health issues and this is making them worse. I am starting to have suicidal thoughts now (no plans or attempts and I’m talking to someone). I have tried it all; otc drugs, prescriptions, tea, bathes, meditation, cutting caffeine, no alcohol, no screens, winding down, getting up if I can’t sleep. Nothing helps! Nothing!!!!! I need to sleep? Anyone have any advice?!
Signal	it might have been my own fault for staying up too late on my phone anyways, but it’s 5 in the morning and i haven’t slept a bit. i’m not even sure if i’m tired. i took a 2-3 hour nap yesterday (?) and i’m not sure if that had anything to do with it but i couldn’t even close my eyes. i just sat there waiting for sleep and it didn’t come. i was sort of feelings anxious again that i’d “never be able to fall asleep again” so that probably impacted it. but i’m so fucking irritated because i just wanted to fall asleep but i couldn’t. my body wanted to but my brain was thinking too much. and now it’s light outside and i’m afraid i’ve missed my chance. it’s so irritating. i just want to fall asleep :(
Signal	i'm so tired of insomnia kicking my ass & my sleep schedule being irregular. also wish i could get a real solution instead of trying to fix it myself... not seeing a lot of progress.
Signal	Hi there, I am FREAKING out right now because of insomnia specifically a fear of SFI or even FFI. Within the past ~one week or so, I started to get insomnia, pretty much for the first time ever. It's been coupled with some horrible anxiety, really strange anxiety, some of the worst I've ever had(I've always had anxiety), like I'm having a constant panic attack, then coupled with occasional crying. This was precipitated by my sleep being on a fucked up schedule, before this it was like from 9AM-5PM. I started getting horrible anxiety, and chalked it up to only being up during the night and not seeing daylight(or my family). I decided to fix it, but that didn't really go to well, ultimately it led to deprivation during the day too, so then my anxiety got worse, and then I decided to start practicing some good sleep hygiene, taking a walk before bed, warm shower before, no computer, blue light filter on my phone and only use it a little bit, lights out, go to sleep at 12:30 or so AM and I took 1.5 benadryls. Still, that night I tossed and turned for like 4-5 hours, until finally I slept until 10 AM or so. Then the next night was the same, good hygiene, took 50mg benadryl and also about 4mg melatonin. Still, tossed and turned until the early morning hours, woke up maybe around 9:30 or so. Next night, same deal, did the hygiene, this time about 62.5mg doxylamine and also about 4mg melatonin, I was a little loopy that night, but it was the same deal, early morning hours, woke up around 9 and again at 12 I believe, that night was spotty. Last night, same deal, did the hygiene, this time 75mg doxylamine and an obscene amount of melatonin, maybe 30-40mg spread out, sleep was spotty but I think I got to sleep around 4-5AM, woke up at 6, again at 11, and then at 12. So obviously, not so good. The past two nights were also weird, as though there was not a clear line between sleeping and being awake, and my sleep was very fractured, also my memory of them is weird, like I thought I slept clean through to 11 but then remembered a brief bit of it being 6 AM. This makes me afraid that maybe my sleep is even more fractured than what I can remember. Overall, it's been over a week since I slept more than a clean 5 hours. Worth noting that while both the doxylamine and the benadryl maybe were a bit/somewhat helpful in feeling tired, definitely neither knocked me out, even the high dose. Then just today I read a bit about SFI on this sub and around on reddit and the web, and now I'm FREAKING out. What makes me nervous is that before any of this happened, it seemed like my balanced was a little weird, like I would get dizzy-light headed more, and it took less to make me feel unbalanced. And, throughout this, my heartrate's been super fast, I measured it a bit ago and it was almost 150. Even when I though I was relaxed today, it was between 120-130. I just measured it now and it was at 93, which is actually amongst the lowest that I've seen since I started measuring. Also I've been getting facial flush, like I'll be doing something and then my face will suddenly get a rush of warmth. Also, my muscles have started to feel weird, like they're worn out, despite barely using them. Right now I was pacing and my legs felt exhausted, and hen after lying down briefly I tried to walk but they felt so weak I almost fell over briefly. And I'm losing weight too, although I've barely eaten the past week, maybe an average of a few hundred calories a day on average, some days maybe barely 100. I don't know how much it is that I've lost, but it's enough that when I put on my belt today it was pretty loose, even kind of hanging off of me. I have also noticed that sometimes I feel either hotter or colder than those around me. At night I get hot and sweat a bit. There isn't an instance of this in my family history, I am FREAKING out about this now. I'm trying rationalize, but it is so hard when things seem to match up. I try to tell myself that this is just anxiety, but it seems so severe, and it came on so suddenly. This is also just about the first time I've ever actually had insomnia properly, outside of it taking a while to get to sleep. The only arrow in my quiver is how exceedingly rare FI is, but still, it's terrifying when the puzzle seems to fit together. I'm so afraid. Please help me rationalize this. I just wanna be okay.
Signal	I've tried it all:Melatonin WeedTemazepam, diazapam and all those Benzos Seroquel Anti histaminesNone work. Only stilnox. And only the first few nights.
NotSignal	I’ve been awake for 48 hours and i feel horrified, i have anxiety and it’s telling me i’m gonna die from insomnia and now i’m so freaked out that i’m sweating in a cold room, i need someone to help me chill out.
NotSignal	Well, I dont know where to start. Obviously I cant sleep like ever. My heart races 24/7, and I can feel it through my whole body, heart doctor said I'm normal, no blockage no high blood pressure. General doctor says the same thing. I've been like this for quite some time, looking for advice and help, anything would be appreciated.
NotSignal	Who else is having a hard time to fall asleep befire 5 am unless they are really tired? As soon as it gets close to 5 or 6 am i find myself getting at least 2-4hours restful sleep.This whole quarantene thing messed up my sleep and next week monday i have to functioj again from 6am...
Signal	m to the point where I only sleep every 2-3 days. Flat out, can't even close my eyes for 24hrs+. And even when do sleep, it's only for a few hours. In the past 4 days I have slept maybe 11hrs, which isn't even enough for 2 days of sleep. And this type of thing was happening well before the pandemic happened. For 3 months straight I didn't fall asleep until 5am, and had to get up shortly after and go to work. But over the past month, the earliest I'll be able to even close my eyes is somewhere between 11am and 12pm. The no sleep problem has been going on for years, but never this bad. I'm 22 years old. In 8th grade, and from then on I couldn't sleep all night. I would eventually fall asleep between 3am and 5am, and then get up few hours later and go to school for 8 or so hours and later on in life go to work after school for 5 hours. This went on for a few years. My mom never took me to the doctor for anything that was wrong with me since 3rd grade when I had an ear infection. So fast forward to after I graduated, I think I was 19, I started going to the doctor for my depression that I've had since 8th grade, that I never even bothered to tell my mom about because she would have just yelled at me about it anyway (she had a lot of of issues, but those stories are for a different time). So when going to the doctor, I started taking birth control and trying multiple antidepressants. By the third medicine I tried, I had decided it was the right one but not strong enough. My doctor then prescribed me a off brand Abilify to add to it. For the next year that I took it, I slept alllll the time. Way too much. Eventually I started falling asleep while driving. So I went to my doctor and told her about it. She said I had all the symptoms of narcolepsy or possibly sleep apnea and I needed to go to the sleep doctor. I went to the sleep doctor and they said the same thing and that I need to do a sleep study. But they also said that Abilify can cause you to be extremely tired.So instead of actually doing the sleep study, I decided to just cut out my medications and supplements completely and see what happened. I am aware that this is dangerous, I have been told this several times, I've done it several times, and I don't want to hear it. Anywho, almost instantly, I couldn't sleep anymore and I started doing the whole stay up til 5am thing again. And that's pretty much where I am today. I know I need to go to the doctor, but I can't at the moment because I get my insurance through work and haven't worked due to the virus. If you have any idea what's happening to me or if you have gone through something similar and can tell me what to do in the mean time, please sound off below.
NotSignal	4h before bad, lets se if it helps sleeping better.
Signal	Ive never really had any problems with sleeping my whole life. I would always go to sleep at around 10, or if i stayed up late at night i would have no problem falling asleep at a regular time the next day. Until winter break started. I started going to sleep at 2-4am every night and i physically could not go to sleep at 10 anymore. This was fine until class was about to start again, so i was reading that if i stayed up all night, i could fall asleep at a regular time the next day and be back on the normal schedule. Well, needless to say i tried this (on a day where i had class) so i was extremely tired the whole day and kept nodding off like i was about to fall asleep in class. Ive also tried this method plenty of other times and failed and just fell asleep at 4-5am because i was so tired. I dont know what to do, i start trying to fall asleep at around 10-11pm and even take melatonin every night and cannot fall asleep! I need to get my sleep schedule back on track!
Signal	I have a fair share of childhood trauma and at a young age began having night terrors that ended in me waking up screaming. I developed insomnia that I haven't been able to shake since because I was scared to fall asleep. If I take melatonin or a sleeping aid, it just interrupts my sleep and makes my dreams disturbing. Eventually, I got the night terrors under control somehow to the point where I no longer scream, but I often silently cry or hyperventilate. I don't experience them nearly as often as I did when I was a kid, but when I do, they're still pretty severe. Sometimes they spiral into panic attacks. I can get the night terrors mostly under control to where they become a rare occurrence, and I actually haven’t had them more then once quarterly for a while. But, the last couple of months have not been great in terms of my anxiety levels and they’re flaring up again. I want to get better and sleep normal, consistently. Not just when my body’s had enough. I know the long term effects of sleeping habits like these can’t be good. I'm not really sure what this is, but nonetheless, I'm tired. I love enjoying waking up early and enjoying sleep but neither are really possible all the time. Even when I don't have night terrors, I usually have nightmares if I dream. They are usually pretty disturbing and realistic and leave me shaken up for a while after. I meditate, I run long distance - sometimes twice a day - I read before bed and stay off my devices but once they start I genuinely get scared to fall asleep again. Does anyone else experience this?
Signal	I am new to Lunesta and I took 2mg last night to help me sleep. That’s the amount the doctor prescribed. I am told I was up at 4am cooking with boiling oil and I said there were shadow people in the room. I have no recollection of it. Are these type of behaviors common while taking lunesta?
Signal	I’ve been having on and off sleeping issues this past year. I’ve tried very breathing exercise, every little trick I usually use, asmr videos, guided meditations but the fear of not sleeping keeps me up and I’m losing my mind. It’s my cousins wedding tomorrow and I need to be functioning for it and I really just feel defeated by brain and anxiety surrounding sleep. What should I do?
NotSignal	I generally would go on my phone and play online chess or scrabble. But this is too stimulating. What are things that don’t involve looking at your phone that help you wind down right before you sleep?
NotSignal	I think this is a new record since it got really bad in September 2018. It's actually unbelievable. I'm scared to hope but...I think...maybe it's finally over? My last record was September last year when I slept well six days in a row but I was camping.I'm just so grateful. Other people take this for granted but to me it's like heaven. Really hope my body will just like, "click" remember how to sleep. Wish me luck people.
Signal	I'm sure most of us have tried one sort of aid or another. I have tried:Halcion (not sure about spelling)AmbienTriazolamXanaxMelatoninMagnesium Benadryl Nothing works well... doctors won't prescribe the shit that works long term. I saw a post about being genetically predisposed to having insomnia. My grandmother and father both have/had trouble falling asleep. I have no problem sleeping until 10 or 11 am, but can't get to bed at a decent hour. Sorry this was more of a frustrated rant than anything, but I'd appreciate any helpful feedback or advice.
NotSignal	Hi I'm 16 years old and I have this problem which started off tonight where everytime I go to sleep my heart starts beating faster and i have anxiety because I want to sleep so badly but i cant please help me. I am shaking while typing
Signal	I downloaded the Calm app + I’m taking ambien tonight (not my first time)Still hella anxious despite meditation earlier, but does anyone have any tips? I’m feeling hopeless and and pretty depressed ngl
NotSignal	I had been having some issues with getting any sleep for over a month now. Visited around, tried some new methods. I had been having luck with leaving the bedroom after 20mins, staying up as long as possible to get sufficiently tired, trying to keep to a schedule (any), and for a few weeks I managed to bounce back get most of my energy back, my appetite, I was getting better. Today as I got close to when I usually sleep I just couldnt manage it. I feel like a switch got flipped out of nowhere just as I was doing better. It could have something to do with the west coast fire thats changed, but I dont really know. I typically try to avoid sleep aides, most things havent worked before. They do calm me down, make me drowsy, but while going for sleep I experience the hypnic-jerking which wakes me up and leaves me feeling worse off than before. I dont smoke, it doesnt aggree with me at all. I do drink occaisonally, which can help. But I've been trying to cut back for my own health.I dont really know what to do anymore. Its been 28 hours since last I got 6 hours of sleep. Ive tried 8 times when ive gotten exhausted to go lay down, only to maybe watch an hour pass, become awake, change rooms and repeat. Im really stressing my partner out through all of this. I'm so worried about my health due to all this lack of sleep and how its affecting them. Would seriously love to talk to someone, or get some advice, anything
Signal	Hey everyone, So for the past few months I’ve been falling asleep normally but waking up every 2-3 hours and then falling back to sleep. It’s now taking a toll at my work and at home. I suffer from migraines and have neck and shoulder issues(another story to tell at a later time). I should also mention I did have mono pretty bad in college(caught it from talking to my suite mate at her door about rsa stuff). I have tried melatonin, having a routine at bed time, taking the blue screen off my phone. I am not on any meds beside ibuprofen for my migraines/shoulder/neck problems. Just recently, I had a take home sleep study and i got my results today and i do not have sleep apnea. So my question is what advice do you all have because I am completely lost.My mom jokes around saying to smoke weed to help knowing I don’t smoke or to drink a little bit of wine before bed. My problem is with that I don’t want to become dependent on it. I have an appointment in two months as a follow up and would like to hear your input please.Anything at this point would be beneficial.
Signal	I have suffered with insomnia my whole life. During middle school, and high school, I would get a max of 5-6 hours of sleep. NEVER more. I would stay up until 7AM on summer days. I feel like I am alone in this struggle. Who else only got 5 hours of sleep during their school years? I am worried that I stunted my growth, and damaged myself in other ways because of this developmentally. I am now on Zyprexa, Luvox, and Lithium for OCD, which have helped me sleep. But I still worry that I might have been taller if I got enough sleep as a pre-teen and teen. Insomnia sucks so much. I wish all of you well.
NotSignal	Hello this is my first post here. I was wondering if any of you also have a hard time falling asleep at night then once you do its already like 4 in the morning or later even tho you tried going to bed at like 10 at night then when you wale up you realize its noon or later. This happens to me almost every night and was hoping I could get some advice. I've already tried otc sleep aids (melatonin, teas, etc.) but nothing helps. I've also had this problem since middle school (I'm 24 now) and I'd be dead tired all day. Back when I was able to have caffeine (gives me excruciating headaches now) id try to drink monsters and other energy drinks or coffee to help get me thru the day but nothing changed my energy levels. Please I'm tired (no pun intended) of staying up all night even if it just helps for a couple nights I'd greatly appreciate the help. Thank you in advance
Signal	For years I've experienced all sorts of Insomnia that are readily identified. Waking too early, Restless Leg, Racing Mind when trying to fall asleep, ect. I have one type in particular that seems to have no name, or at least one i cant find.This comes in waves for about 3-4 days every couple months. I'm feeling tired and lay down. I can feel myself drifting off to sleep and am not having any problems... Then when I'm in that partial awareness right before true unconsciousness, my mind will snap back into full awareness. Mind you this isn't anxiety or racing thoughts. One second ill be drifting off the next I'll be wide awake and no longer sleepy. After about 15-20 mins of this wide awake alertness with no thoughts, I start to drift back into sleep but the same thing happens. This cycle happens at least 3-4 times before I am finally out.If anyone has a name for this, one that I can actually bring up to my sleep doctor, I would be grateful...PS I have brought it up to them before but they just dismissed it as "Insomnia". I feel like it should have a more specific name to it.
Signal	I’m back again for what feels like the last 10th time this week. Just had yet another sleepless night which was my 3rd one in 6 days. I don’t really get anxious when I’m trying to fall asleep so that isn’t a factor but the main problem is that it takes too much effort to fall asleep for me. I just find it boring to just lie down and close my eyes for 30 mins to fall asleep and also if I do try and shut my eyes to fall asleep my thoughts start to race for some odd reason and that leads to me giving up on falling asleep.As a result of this, I tend to sleep once I literally pass out due to my tiredness and I normally end up sleeping after 2 nights of trying. I know I’m probably not making sense here but I’m really really tired and sick of not being able to sleep and it’s beginning to take a toll on my mental health.
NotSignal	I've been incredibly under the weather and I work in 7 hours. I should be asleep and I can't even think about it it's giving me actual anxiety thinking about sleeping. I've called off three days this pay period and can't afford to call off again.
NotSignal	This has been probably my worst week of sleep. I got 3 days of good sleep and 4 days of the worst which usually doesn’t happen in a whole week. I get a bad sleep once in a week so I was so terrified. Today I haven’t slept at all and I think I’m staying up. I’m really worried about my health.what is wrong with me?i feel dreaded and about to pass out but my head won’t let me sleep.i hope this ends. It’s been 6 months.. I wasn’t like that. I was considered a person who loves to sleep a lot. I used to sleep anywhere. Anytime. Whenever I felt I wanted to. And people used to ask me how. Now it’s all different..what is going on?
NotSignal	There are actually proven methods to beat insomnia. They are detailed very well in two books by sleep scientists: The Insomnia Answer by Glovinsky and Spielman, and Say Goodnight to Insomnia by Jacobs. Most people can do it without drugs or supplements or expensive therapy using various methods explained in these books. The methods certainly worked for me. My sleep fell apart a few years ago but I gradually pieced it back together using the recommendations from these books. I applied a few ideas the very day I started reading one of the books and slept better that night than I had in months. The books are about $16 each on Amazon (e-books or paperback). You can have one or both downloaded and be reading it in the time it takes to read this post. You can do it!
NotSignal	My life is shit now, the person In my life just left me, I have bad sleeping problems since 1 Year back, I have panik attack and sweat alot in my bed. I really miss her since she made me feel good. She was a home I could return to. I've lost it all now, I just want her back. Guys I don't know what do to I'm losing my mind, should I be looking up a physiatrist? I want to be with her, I want to touch her, I want to spend my time with her.Should I look for a physiatrist?
NotSignal	If someone only sleeps for around 4 hours per night for many years and then activity tried to improve their sleep quality and quantity to the recommended level.How would the sleep deprivation impact the person cognitively?Would there be any permanent damage?Could that person recover from the issues after fixit their sleep schedule and if yes, to what extent?How much improvement in cognitive ability would you expect from that person?
Signal	i took medication at 8 pm but of course i am still awake i cant do this i am ruining everything by not sleeping i want to throw my self out of my window maybe i will go into a coma so i can fucking sleep
NotSignal	I start a new job on Saturday morning, but I’m worried about being able to sleep properly the night before so I can get up in the morning. I feel asleep at 7am this morning after being up all night, and slept until 4pm. I know I’ll have a hard time sleeping tonight, especially because I don’t have access to any sleeping medication or aids other than melatonin. Does anyone have some advice so that I can hopefully turn everything around in time for my shift on Saturday?
NotSignal	Because I'm not getting any sleep. Ever. Every damn night is the same thing. I take a shower, go to the bathroom, feed my guinea pig and brush my teeth. I lay down in bed and I don't feel a state of unconsciousness. It sucks. And those times where I nearly do doze off, I feel this weird feeling like I'm falling from a building. Then I jump back up and start from square one. I've got a life! I've got shit to do! And what do I get? Sure as hell not a good night of sleep. Sometimes, my guinea pig will wheek and that'll make things worse. But I can't get mad, because all he needs is love and affection, so I give that to him. And sometimes, philosophical questions pop up, and I have to Google it. Then, I try to go to bed and guess what? Another philosophical question comes out of freaking nowhere! So, the next time someone asks me why I'm such a rude, ill tempered guy, it's because I can't get decent sleep like everyone else.
NotSignal	Ugh last several summers I just can’t help but wake up with the morning light. Even with good blinds and an eye mask. Whereas in the winter I’m more a night owl. Has anyone experienced this? Worsened sleep in the summer? Does anyone adjust their sleep schedule in the summer. I am considering moving bedtime earlier around 9-10 for a 6-7 am waking time.
NotSignal	Has anyone else only been able to get sleep from naps during the daytime/afternoon? I try to sleep at normal times, during the night, and I just can't fall asleep...So I've only been getting sleep from naps, which is 2 hours a day. If I skip the naps, I won't get any sleep at all. I feel like I'm slowly dying.
Signal	Hey, everyone!I’ve had trouble sleeping for the past month. Living far up north, we have 24 hour sunlight which I am sure is a contributing factor. Anyway, I’ve noticed that I usually need a good amount of THC to sleep. I now take it with 100mg Trazodone prescribed by the doctor I went to see and some magnesium before bed. I sleep consistently between 11-1130, but find myself waking up between 3-5AM on workdays. I thought this was an ongoing problem, but I took a 6 day vacation and I slept through the night, every night!!Because of this, I feel that work is the likely culprit.Have any of you experienced “next work day anxiety” that affects your sleep? Did you fix it? How?Would very much appreciate any help. I know I’ll have to change my attitude towards my work, but I do care about my job. I’m thinking it’s because I’m not compartmentalizing properly, but any feedback is welcome.
Signal	Three nights in a row with no sleep after just taking a prescription of 10 Ativan over a one month period. Finally fell asleep for 2 hours after 3 nights of laying awake. Not feeling well. Has anyone health with this.
NotSignal	Sleep problems can be caused by various physical, medical, psychiatric, or environmental factors. It is true that about half of the people over the age of 65 have some type of sleep disorder.Sleep problems can be caused by various factors. Although causes might differ, the end result of all sleep disorders is that the body's natural cycle of slumber and daytime wakefulness is disrupted or exaggerated.Factors that can cause sleep problems are:* Physical (such as ulcers)* Medical (such as asthma)* Psychiatric (such as depression and anxiety disorders)* Environmental (such as alcohol)Short-term or acute insomnia can be caused by life stresses (such as job loss or change, death of a loved one, or moving), an illness, or environmental factors such as light, noise, or extreme temperatures.Long-term or chronic insomnia (insomnia that occurs at least three nights a week for a month or longer) can be caused by factors such as depression, chronic stress, and pain or discomfort at night. A common cause of chronic insomnia is a conditioned emotional response. Thoughts about the sleep problem (e.g., "What if I don’t fall asleep tonight?") and behaviors that develop around the sleep problem (e.g., sleeping in and napping, ruminating in bed) tend to maintain insomnia symptoms.Other factors that can interfere with sleep:**Allergies and Respiratory Problems**Allergies, colds, and upper respiratory infections can make it challenging to breathe at night. The inability to breathe through your nose can also cause sleeping difficulties.**Nocturia**Nocturia, or frequent urination, may disrupt your sleep by causing you to wake up during the night. Hormonal imbalances and diseases of the urinary tract may contribute to the development of this condition. (Be sure to call your doctor right away if frequent urination is accompanied by bleeding or pain.)**Chronic Pain**Constant pain can make it difficult to fall asleep. It might even wake you up after you fall asleep. Some of the most common causes of chronic pain include:* arthritis* chronic fatigue syndrome* fibromyalgia* inflammatory bowel disease* persistent headaches* continuous lower back painIn some cases, chronic pain may even be exacerbated by sleep disorders. For instance, doctors believe the development of fibromyalgia might be linked to sleeping problems.**Genetics**Researchers have found a genetic basis for narcolepsy, a neurological disorder of sleep regulation that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness.**Working the night shift**People who work at night often experience sleep disorders because they cannot sleep when they start to feel drowsy. Their activities run contrary to their "biological clocks."**Medicines**Many medicines can interfere with sleep, check side effects.**Aging**About half of all adults over the age of 65 have some sort of sleep disorder. It is not clear if it is a normal part of aging or a result of medicines that older people commonly use.
Signal	Hi! I tend to be very sensitive to medicine but I'm having terrible insomnia at the moment. I have lorazapam at home (1mg tablets) which I've never taken before. Does anyone have experience taking lorazapam for sleep ? How much should I take? How is it likely to affect me?Any advice welcome.
NotSignal	Example: 5 hours is your average per week (some nights being 3, others 6, etc.).I have been averaging around 3-5 hours a night for quite awhile now and I’m curious about everyone else’s journey.Tell me how long you’ve been struggling and what your average is and how you cope as well as if you do or don’t take meds. Thanks!
Signal	I’m 16 and I’ve always had trouble sleeping I can never just fall asleep. I can lay in bed for 6 hours with my eyes closed and just not fall asleep it’s mainly because my thoughts are always racing and sometimes my legs twitch or do something to where it makes me feel uncomfortable and now I’m stressing over if me not sleeping is affecting my height and its now all I think about when I try to sleep. And when I do somehow manage to sleep I only sleep like 6 hours and i feel like I’m still awake half of the time it never a deep sleep. I’ve taken melatonin and it doesn’t work. I really just do not know what to do it’s really pissing me off cause all I want to do is sleep
Signal	Hi, i never realy had problems sleeping. Sometimes i wasn't able to sleep because of stress but the next day i would sleep like a baby. Now i just can't sleep even if i tired and not stressed. On sunday it was too hot to sleep and i slept only 2 hours. Same thing for monday . I was able to sleep on tuesday for at least 6 hours but it took me the entire night. I went to sleep at 8:30 and slept around 6 or 7 in the morning. And yesterday wednesday i went to sleep at 3 in the morning and spent 7 hours in the bed trying to sleep. Now i'm completely tired and i can't sleep even if i try. Any advice on catching some sleep ? I never had problems like that.
Signal	Does anyone else get this? For the last couple months, every time I start dreaming, I get an internal shaking feeling that wakes me up. I confirmed with my wife that I’m not actually shaking, but it feels like a deep internal shake in my head. My heart rate is slightly elevated but never above 65bm. It all started semi frequently and now has progressed into nightly, every time I enter the dream stage. I’m not having bad dreams at all. I’ve tried all the basic sleep hygiene techniques as well as Trazodone and Gabapentin, nothing helps. I have no problem falling asleep.
NotSignal	Beg for mercy from your own mind,hope that your anxiety will be kind.Tell yourself that you will sleep,though you know, deep down, it's a promise you cannot keep.The hours tick by, as you continue to try, your efforts only to be worthlessThe heart beat quickens, and a blanket of dread thickens, and soon you're lying there hopeless.There's a spark of hope, a lamp in the fog, of the thoughts you try to conceive. Perhaps one day sleep will allow, from your anxiety, you to leave, and hope will return so maybe, just maybe, you should believe.
NotSignal	Looking for someone who has a casper or nectar flagship mattresses to shoot a short (about 3 minute) footage of it that I can use in my project. You can do it for free or I can pay for it. Message for more details. Thanks!
Signal	It all started about a month ago after an alcohol binge. Since then when i try to fall asleep my heart is racing and keeps awake. If i try some relaxing before sleep and focus on my breathing it kinda stops but thats not the main issue. The nost anoying part its that whe i finnaly sleep incant STAY asleep. Its like my body cant get into deep sleep . I sleep and wake up every 1-2 hours During every night and i can remember every dream i see since i know i REM sleep alot. After 8-9 hours in bed i get up feeling not rested at all. Some ppl here recommended magnesium supplements. Will ir help? Also any advice? I dont think im an stressful person and i dont suffer from depression.
NotSignal	I have an interesting question and situation. So 2 nights ago I had a potent shot of expresso. Right after I was feeling really anxious so I decided to try this kava stuff I got online. (Kava is supposed to make you intoxicated like alcohol) After awhile I didn’t really notice anything so I took some more but this time I took like 15 servings in one little class. It was getting late so right after I decide to take cbd (without thc) like usual. I heard this htp5 stuff is supposed to help you sleep so I took some too. After awhile I realized I was starting to get really dizzy, it felt like my head was moving slower then the rest of me. That whole night I had an extreme hyperactive, manic effect. I also felt euphoric with 0 anxiety. I wouldn’t stop talking to my friends all night. The next day I felt absolutely terrible. I felt depressed, ashamed and embarrassed. I read up about 5htp and kava and I learned that your not supposed to mix 5htp with ssris. I take Prozac and Wellbutrin. And now I have no idea which substance has which effect on me. Did the kava cause the intoxication effect and the 5htp cause the mania and crash the next day, or vis versa? Did the caffeine or cbd have anything to do with it? I’m too afraid to try kava or htp5 again, so any help or personal experiences would be helpful. This may not be the ideal subreddit to post this, so let me know if a different subreddit would be better for this question.
Signal	You can't sleep? Oh, i sometimes can't sleep either. How bad can it be? Are you really complaining about this? Even if they don't outright say it like this, people's complete lack of empathy and sympathy and how they gloss over it already show they don't take u seriously for a second. They don't understand *how much* you can suffer from this. And it's almost embarrassing if u would even try to explain because people make u feel so trivial about it. Without sleep there is no life. And this shit is *literally* ruining my life terribly. I might fail college in my last year because i can't even get myself to do one assignment and it makes me feel so stressed and scared and horrible. I'm so so so scared of failing and i don't know what to do anymore.
NotSignal	So I was wondering.What do you people do when insomnia hits you like a train? Just lay there trying to fall asleep or are you actually doing something.Usually I just keep laying there reading, watching tiktoks etc, but tonight I decided to just do my makeup, to my partners chagrin.
Signal	Took it for insomnia due to anxiety. Now I take it and after 2 hours realize I never fell asleep. So I end up taking another half pill at this point and it knocks me oit
NotSignal	Here I am again.10am and didn't sleep at all last night. Got up at 4pm yesterday. It's going to feel like hell in a few hours. I might fall asleep early at like 4pm and mess it all up again. I have been through this so many times.
NotSignal	I’m actually planning on putting a podcast on and falling asleep right after I type this post. But I just wanted to come here and check in on the rest of you insomniacs before I shut down. I know a huge part of my insomnia is my phone addiction. I use it as a clutch so I don’t feel anxious about being alone often. I need to be more irl social and really just slowly stop using my phone as... a friend and comfort for everything. Good night y’all
Signal	I quit drinking recently which has caused some pretty bad insomnia. I have barely been able to sleep for the past 3 weeks or so. I'm working my way through all of that but one thing that has been freaking me out since this started is how time feels like it is moving. Yesterday I was messing around on Reddit for what felt like 30 minutes and it was actually 2 hours. I feels like I am having significant trouble remembering events throughout the day. It's not like I'm blacking out or something, I can give a general idea of what was going on. I just can just barely remember the most of what I was doing throughout the day. Is that typical for insomnia?
Signal	Hey guys, so I have had a real hard time (especially) falling asleep, for the last 4 months or so. I guess even before that, it wasnt easy, but it's especially been difficult in the last 4 months or so (before the corona virus lockdown). Whenever i lay down to sleep, my mind wanders a lot, and I end up thinking all kinds of things, especially bad experiences I have had to experience in the past (though it's not limited to that, and very commonly my mind wanders to the most trivial things too, like what happened throughout the day etc). I am not sure if that is what they call mind racing. I would rather call it mind wandering, in my experience. I sometimes listen to sports podcasts to quieten my mind and that helps me to fall sleep, but even that doesnt work sometimes. Oh and I experience **hypnagogic sleep hallucination** right before I am about to drift into sleep. In fact, these hallucinations are a great indicator that I am about to drift into sleeping. So, falling asleep is a REAL problem for me.Another thing is that I have started experiencing a very restless sleep and I toss and turn a lot. And if I wake up in the middle of the night, it is very difficult to go back to sleep, even if I am physically tired. I also somehow can only sleep for 8 hours MAX, even if i havent slept well in days, and my body really needs a solid 10+ hours of sleep. I wake up tired everyday, because I know I need more sleep, but I just cant seem to get more sleep.I like to think that I have decent sleep hygiene (no lights, cool temperature, no food or screen time an hour before sleeping etc), so that is not a problem for me.Are there any ways to fix this, or is there something I am suffering from that I dont know about??I would like to add that I have bad social experiences in the past (especially in my college days), and these issues have stayed unresolved, and I do end up thinking about them sometimes when I lay in bed to sleep. But i dont suffer from clinical depression or crippling social anxiety. I feel like a lot of my negative emotions are repressed at the moment.Also, throughout my school and college days (I am almost 26 years old now), I had a terrible sleeping schedule, and definitely didnt focus enough on getting enough sleep. I ALWAYS used to have a hard time getting up for my 8am classes (who doesnt tho :p ), so my biological clock definitely suffered.Tldr; I have a REAL problem not only falling asleep but also staying asleep and I always end up feeling tired after I wake up. All this despite a decent sleep hygiene. Could be due to past psychological trauma, bad sleeping schedule, or something entirely different that I have no idea about. HELP NEEDED
NotSignal	Its happening, I thought I could escape the brain decay insomnia brings until today I realized I can't even speak properly no more, I can't even get one syllable words out. I get asked to repeat myself all the time and it sucks. It's probably no coincidence that this comes after 2 months of my sleep getting even worse
NotSignal	Just curious to see how many times other people wake up a night I wake up once or twice, So not super horrible but still annyoing
NotSignal	I see a lot of people on here doing CBT-I, and a lot of the CBT stuff is very useful. And certainly, you shouldn't go to bed until you're so tired that you can barely walk. However...In my experience of being a FORMER years-long insomniac and having tried CBT-I, the intentional sleep restriction aspect is based on a faulty premise. The idea behind it is that your bed time strongly depends on your wake time that morning. This is bullshit IMO. If you wake up an hour later, you don't automatically get to sleep an hour later.So if sleep restriction is causing anxiety and making it harder to sleep, just don't do it. The idea that staying in bed a little longer or taking an afternoon nap causing sleep problems is mostly wrong. There can SOMETIMES be a weak correlation, but it's not the strong correlation that the CBT-I practitioners claim. Listen to your body! A nap or sleeping in on a Sunday morning is the best time to build the positive association with bed time that CBT says is so important.
NotSignal	I was watching a documentary on YouTube breaking down the abnormal behavior of Chris Watt’s concerning his missing wife and two young daughters. The video shows the actual footage of when Chris Watt’s met an officer and his wife’s BF at his home. As you watch the footage you watch how everyone is getting more and more upset, worried and scared, Except for Chris. It’s pointed out (around 13:30 mark) his wife’s BF touches his wife’s cell phone and she immediately has a very extreme and paranormal reaction. Moments later (14:00 mark) you can see in the bedroom on the left side hiding behind the door frame is a little girl!! And just when you see her and think WTF, the screen shows a photo of the two daughters hugging-it appears that the ghost is wearing the same exact outfit that was shown in the photo!! I went through the comments to see if anyone had pointed it out and there was no comment of the sort. What do you think?[Possible recording of Chris Watt’s daughter’s ghost](https://youtu.be/2ZJzEZ8Y-rM)
NotSignal	How do you guys stop the hypnic jerks for a few months I’ve been getting hypnic jerks several times a week it’s so a annoying when I’m trying to fall a sleep up get a jerk with a shot of adrenaline anyone have tips on how to slow them down are they a sign of anything bad? It’s very frustrating to deal with sometimes I just with i didn’t have to worry about these when I try to fall asleep but sometimes I’ll get like 5 a night and it takes me two hours to fall asleep.
NotSignal	Can’t stop yawning. Caffeine would hurt my stomach & make my anxiety worse. 3.5 more hours of work is my definition of hell, I’m not sure how I’m going to get through this one.
Signal	So my friend has been on Ambien for years. Then she stopped taking it and has been able to fall asleep without it for a couple weeks now. She stopped taking the pills about a month ago i believe. But she had absolutely no sleep for 2 nights now and she doesn't even seem tired. And for the past few nights she only gets a total of 3-4 hours each night. She doesn't stay asleep for more than 2 hours at a time. She also suffers from ADHD, ptsd and depression. She used to rely on Ambien to not lie awake thinking of the past, but now since she's not on Ambien anymore, the thought of the past keeps her awake and is making her depression significantly worse. I feel so helpless because I want to help her fall asleep, but it seems like the past is just too awful and she'd rather stay awake rather than lie down and think before falling asleep. She also talks about how she can't be "alone with her thoughts". Is there anything I can do to help? She really needs to sleep. :( Thank you all in advance
NotSignal	I just sit in bed for hours. My eyes feel heavy, I make thoughts slower, and I feel miserable. I have to force myself to sleep on the occasions that I do. It’s 3:47 right now, and that’s when it struck me, this was relatively early for me, as I go many nights sleepless, and others just a few hours. I feel no urge to sleep, and the only time it feels possible, is during the day. I feel tired, but at the same time I don’t, I can’t explain it well but that’s what it is. I have no urge to sleep, and I just can’t bring myself to do it. I tell myself, I’ll go to sleep in five minutes, but by the time I get to it, two hours have passed. Even when I attempt to force myself asleep, it’s challenging to say the least. I takes so long, and every time I do it, my brain just floods with thoughts that will Inevitably scare me. I feel desperate for good sleep as it never happens.
Signal	Okay for the most part I have insomnia where no matter how many hours I lay in bed I can’t go to sleep at all. I’ve tried melatonin and still can’t seem to get any leverage on my tiredness. When I eventually do go to sleep I end up sleeping for a whole day or close to it. Usually I find some kind of schedule for me to sleep but lately It has gone wild to points where I’d stay up for two days and then eventually missing my shift.Leading me to the next point. So I worked at Starbucks and i was working there for a solid year with minor misdemeanors and showing up late. I was going to tell my manager about my problems and she told me that day that she was separating me from the company. So now I’m stuck without a job, needing to pay bills and I really just want my job back. I have a lot of good friends there that stick their necks out for me. I’m just so lost in a spiraling turn into depression and anxiety.
Signal	I had insomnia my whole life and could never fall asleep until after 2 AM for as long as I can remember. I did not wake up in the morning, 'normal' AM hours were an alien planet to me. On my own, I fell asleep at 2-4AM and woke up 12-2PM. But of course, school was totally a thing (sadly) so as a teenager I only got 4 hours sleep on most days. No, I did not learn anything ever in school, every single class was a desperate attempt for a nap, a challenge to see how long I could blank until I woke up to angry teacher noises. I would come home after school, practically faint onto my bed until dinnertime, and continue the cycle of insomnia until the early hours. Turns out I had delayed sleep-phase disorder as part of my ADHD, and I am now medicated at 21 with functional normal sleep cycle. Cheers, amphetamines! But anyway, I was wondering whether chronic insomnia like this could have affected my growth. I'm noticeably shorter than all my friends, I have chronic muscle pain, headaches and tummy issues with no explanation. As a teen, I was overweight, constipated with acid reflux, constant headaches and pains. Could the insomnia have left permanent damage?
Signal	Working out, melatonin, aromatherapy, intense skating sessions, none of it works. Contemplating seeing a doctor again to get a prescription (I was on trazodone 5 years back, might see about it again). Thoughts/suggestions?
NotSignal	Has anyone here ever gotten this weird condition of sudden insomnia. Like just one day you wake up with brain fog and are confused. Then you just can't sleep and when you do you feel un refreshed? It's been happening its me for 4 weeks and it's killing me. I don't know what to do and I am scared it's something fatal but idk..... Im not sure if maybe i got ebv and now have cfs or something isn't right. I have been also experiencing neurological problems like tingling around my body and a lot of different headaches.... I'm scared guys :(NEVER had problems with sleep/ insomnia. Is this maybe a medically induced insomnia.... I don't wake up refreshed why?!?!?!.
NotSignal	I have never been diagnosed with insomnia but this situation is way more common than I would like. I feel my depression might be the cause. I am depressive, I have ADHD and anxiety. Lately I have been feeling really depressive. Yet my family doesn’t let me take any medications. I NEED SOMETHING TO SLEP PLEASE
NotSignal	The other day I went to sleep at 6 in the morning and then woke up at 6pm. I was recently in a car crash so I haven't gone to work and I just completely messed up my sleep schedule. My body and mind feels so out of whack.
Signal	Ever since I was young there are some nights I go without sleep, not a second of sleep. Other nights I sleep like a baby. For example the last 3 weeks everytime I have to work I do not sleep it’s not like I’m stressed about work but yet I still do not sleep. Right now I’m part time and not in classes but when I am this can easily go on for 5 days until my body crashes. Right now it’s usually one to two days because once the weekend hits I have no problems. Once I’m asleep I’m asleep but if I don’t fall asleep I don’t sleep. I have tried all the regular bs reading counting melatonin whatever if it’s one of those night it’s just not happening. I’m a 22 m not on any drugs use to be on stims for adhd but do not take anymore because of side effects. I am very against taking prescription drugs for obvious reasons. just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and any solutions they have had. Sorry for shitty grammar it’s 9 am after a sleepless night.
NotSignal	The internets has informed me that caffeine stays in our bodies for up to 12 hours after consumption, thus leading to likely trouble falling asleep until the caffeine has left our bodies. (Most people counter this with sedatives like Alcohol at night). &#x200B;Since sedation is not real sleep and insomnia is a very real and common problem, I'm left to wonder if there are any more efficient means to get the caffeine out of the system (or counter its effects) e.g. with an Adenosine agonist since Caffeine is an A1 and A2a **antagonist.**
NotSignal	I had severse insomnia for 3 years. Huge negative impact. It's alittle better now, I manage to sleep without tons of medication. But still shitty sleep. My biggest issue is I always wake up after 3-4 hours and cannot go back to sleep. Im on day 6 of my Sleep restriction therapy now. 5 hour sleep window. Bedtime 02.30, rise and shine 07.30. Been a rough week, but atleast I fall asleep within 10 minutes and without any melatonin (big deal for me)... However.. I still wake up 30-40 mins before my alarm and cannot go back asleep. So i've average 4 hours of sleep this week. My question is... Should I lower my sleep window even more? Since im currently awake 30-40 mins in bed each night before my alarm.. isent that "harmful" from relearning to sleep? Should I lower my time or stay on 5 hours another week and see? I will check with my doctor next week. Just wanting some second opinions
Signal	I’ve tried nearly everything to sleep better. Right now I take temazepam, but it’s starting to feel like my body is just adjusting to it and it’s less effective than it used to be. I meditate on a daily basis, so I’ve started to listen to guided sleep meditations or sometimes just sleep sounds. The problem with these is that as i slide into that super relaxed state right before sleep, any kind of noise jolts me awake and gives me panic attacks. (This can be traffic, neighbors, or even the speaker in the meditation that waited one second too long to start talking again.) After that, I’m pretty much fucked as far as sleeping goes that night. Anyone else heard of or experienced this? Why does this happen? What can I do to avoid it?
NotSignal	I got 30 mins but I was dreaming? It made no sense, isnt rem supposed to hit at 1 hour and 30 mins of sleep?
Signal	i’ve been having insomnia for the past month, but for the past few days my muscles keep twitching and u can literally see them popping up and down, most notably my inner ankles near my heels for both legs. is this normal or is this a sign of something more?? xanax does jack shit i am able to fall asleep better but i always wake up within 3 hours.
NotSignal	I have an Oura ring prescribed by my doctor to try to work on better understanding my insomnia. I have learned some interesting things about my sleep patterns and some things have helped. I have also found that when I am in a flare, seeing how little sleep I got isn’t always helpful. What has your experience been? Any tips?
Signal	It’s an antipsychotic and is also prescribed as a sleep aid in smaller doses- I’m taking about 75mg I think. I’ve read that it’s not really regulated as a sleeping aid and was just curious about anyone else’s experiences with it. Personally for me I don’t feel insanely drowsy but I do manage to fall asleep without realising when I close my eyes in bed.
Signal	I tried a few over the course of 10 years and I’ve found ambien to be the most effective at getting me to sleep somewhat consistently with little no side effects in the morning. Sure I may have accidentally ordered stuff on amazon while on ambien but I’d rather get good sleep lol.
NotSignal	Just looking for some advice.My problem is my hubby emits heat like the sun. Like I fell asleep last night before he came to bed. As soon as he got in bed I woke up (2 hours later) normally I can fall asleep again but this time...it's like I'm laying next to a space heater.Idk what to do, I moved the AC to the bedroom, I had practically no clothes on and I wasn't using a blanket. He's so hot I just can't.Summer won't be ending for another month or so, I can't keep going on like this x.x
Signal	I've tried sleep restriction in the past, starting with 5 hours and then increasing the time by half an hour. This by-the-book method however made it hard for me to get up at a sleep phase appropriate time and when I actually managed to pull myself from deep sleep like that, I'd have to deal with hangovers for as long as 10 hours, no exaggeration. This, couple with the sleep deprevation, lead to a rather depressing time and had barely any longterm effect on my sleep quality. But I've gotta try again.I know that when I fall asleep quickly, I'll be awake in about 3 hours and won't be able to sleep for the next couple of hours. I assume what happens is that in these cases, my body had 2 rather high quality sleep cycles and finds that it had enough, if only temporarily. So why don't I work with what my body already offers and go from there?So here's the plan:- I start with 3 hours sleep restriction, instead of 5. The aim is to trigger my 3 hour high quality sleep on a regular basis. Let's say 3 am to 6 am.- Once I've had a full week of reliable 3 hour sleep and my body is begging me to get more, I get to bed at 1:30 am, raising my bed time to 4.5 hours. - Repeat process until I get to 6 hours, then 7.5 hour.- ProfitTo support this I could do the following:- Kick my day off with a long low-intense excercise session right after wake time.- Get a sleep phase alarm to avoid those hangovers. Thoughts?- Use a light therapy lamp and try to avoid light until then. Instead of using it right after I get up, I'll use it 16 hours before bedtime. Initially this would be... 11:00? Guess I'll start work in the afternoon, then.. Or should I just use it right after I get up? On the one hand, earlier usage would surpress melatonin right away, but later usage might help regulate the later sleep time and make the last hours easier.- I'll probably won't need to take melatonin supplements to counter my DSPS any longer, so I'll try to get by without.- I might have to take 20 min naps to survive. How many should I allow myself to take and until what time?- I might make regular use of stimulants initially. With ADHD, I have access to some, but I feel modafinil would be more applicable. Problem is, that they raise my heartrate quite a bit..If things go right, I should be done in less than 2 months. I might even drag it out to 3 months. I really fucking need to make this work. Any thoughts and advice is appreciated.
Signal	If so, how was your experience? My psychiatrist prescribed it to me after having anxiety induced insomnia. Took about 2 weeks to semi work, and now it does nothing for me It’s supposed to work 15 mins after taking it. I don’t know what to do anymore, melatonin doesn’t work, this doesn’t work, I’m up until 5 am and even then I get little sleep. When I do sleep, I have lucid dreams and have recently started talking in my sleep. I’m at my wits end!!!
NotSignal	Okay so I have work within the next half hour and I haven’t slept at all basically, most I got was 30 minutes to an hours worth and I feel like crap, boss wants us in even though our jobs receptionist had covid-19 and they had us not work for what they said was 2 weeks but it’s only been a week and 3 days, so what would you guys do in my shoes, go into work or not
Signal	in the last 72 hours ive slept like 8-9 hours... i didn't sleep from sunday (woke up 5 pm) to tuesday (slept at 3 am) and i woke up at 11 am it's currently 3 am and even with little amount of sleep i am not tired... i got to wake up to go to uni in a 3 hours too i took 2x nytol extra strength (i didn't know i only had to take one) a few days ago and it worked great and i took one nytol 2 days ago and it didn't work whatsoever, idk if this is due to taking the 2 nytols i highly doubt it but yeah...
NotSignal	So I don’t sleep a lot. I have an obsession with time so I have to sleep in my sleep cycles meaning I can only sleep either 9, 7.5, 6, 4.5, 3 or 1.5 hours. I don’t sleep a lot because I don’t like to sleep. I like to stay awake and do things. So on most nights I’ll get 4.5 hours of sleep and on some less and some I’ll get 6. I almost never get more sleep than that with the exception of weekends because I have nothing that stops me from continuing to sleep (I’m a high school student with ADHD so getting out of bed is really hard).I have tried to fall asleep earlier but whenever I try I end up just getting up because I’m bored. I want to spend my time useful and do important things or at least fun things. Plus, I prefer to do my nightly routine at 1 to 2 am. It’s more comfy thenI guess I’d say that my sleep problems aren’t because I can’t fall asleep because I just REALLY don’t want to
Signal	I’ve been trying to sleep for the past 5 hours wtf ... I want to say I got an hour nap sorta but I still felt awake like I was just unconscious but still awake ... I can’t stop shaking my foot I’m sweating profusely and I just feel off tbh ... I have to be at work in 5 hours and I’m a heavy sleeper that usually wakes up after a 8 hour sleep period ... so I guess I’ll just stay up because I seem to have no other solution because if I end up falling asleep at 8 then I’ll miss the whole day . This is so fucked .... my stomach hurts a bit , I can feel bags forming under my eyes as I type this out , my Motion and reaction feels a millisecond off (sorta like a high) and my blood pressure feels really fucking tense .... my thoughts are racing ... my everything is racing .... idk if it’s shitty luck ,, improper eating habits , heartbreak, depression, nicotine withdrawal (not even a whole 24 hours since my last smoke so I don’t think that’s the case) but idk what the reason is .... almost a year ago I had this problem where I didn’t sleep for a week because of this girl I met and I couldn’t sleep just out of the fact the I missed her that much where I didn’t sleep until I saw her again (I ended up seeing her and went to sleep like a baby that night I saw her, but that was the last time I saw her ... things didn’t work out) my whole body feels tense ,sore, warm and this is very uncomfortable and exhausting and I have a feeling my day is ruined and will suck because of it .
Signal	I'm on new anxiety meds which should kick in in a few weeks and hopefully help. But I've gotten myself into a pretty miserable vicious cycle.I had a few nights where I woke up for no reason and wasn't able to fall back asleep. And now, whenever I wake up in the middle of the night, I start getting stressed about not being able to sleep... And then I don't sleep. And now that's started happening every night. Usually, I'm a pretty sleepy person - no problems falling/staying asleep, have to have multiple alarms etc. So these past 2 weeks have been a whole new world, and I'm not a fan. Why doesn't my brain realize it's screwing itself over...
Signal	I used to struggle with insomnia as a child into young teens, but then I started sleeping normally, with the exception of a few days here and there. Now for the past few weeks, I’ve been sleeping horribly every night. I feel more and more dead each day. I was up pretty much all night last night and now I have to go to work. I used to be used to this when I was younger but now it’s been so long that I’d forgotten how it felt. I don’t know what to do. I feel so dead and sad
Signal	Hey, it’s my first post on Reddit. For some background : It’s been 2 months since I have insomnia. I can tell that the root cause is definitly anxiety. The trigger is that I pulled an all nighter for no reason. What I mean by that is that there was no exterior or interior stresser that kept me awake. The following day and nights I developped a fear of not being able to sleep. My nights became shorter and shorter until somehow it got a little better when I saw my GP. I spoke to him about my anxiety and how it caused me to have insomnia. He made me take a quiz to mesure my level of anxiety and determine if he could prescribe me some anxiety meds. Turns out my score was not high enough so I got nothing for my anxiety. (Which is totally normal since he made me a do a quizz to diagnose GAD-.-) Since my sleep was getting a little better I had to push him to prescribe me some sleeping pills just in case it went bad. He did the talk about sleep hygiene which obviously dosen’t work when you have chronic insomnia. He wasn’t worried and he was sure my sleep would be back on track.Since i’m quarantined (it’s been a month now) it’s been going worse. I started to use Zopiclone daily to sleep every night. (I was sleeping for an amount of 4 to 5 hours when taking the pill - which is not good but much better than what I was getting). Since last week, I think 7.5 mg stopped working. I’m frequently having sleepless nights to to point where i’m scared of having more than one in a row. To cope with my insomnia i’m currently having thoughts that I never had before. I’m now obssesced with pills. I’m looking for any pill that I can find that’s going to relax my brain and help me sleep. I’m even to the point where I regularly drink alchool in hopes that it makes me sleepy enough to fall asleep. I tried to not think about sleep and just go through my day but my sleep never gets better, it only gets worse. I’m a college student and I have online classes, exams, assignments, I feel like i’ve reached a point where I really need help. Right now i’m thinking of either calling my GP and try to ask him of another prescription of pills (meanwhile I treat the anxiety) or try to set up an appointment with a Therapist first, then see what the therapist says and call my GP after?? Im sorry if its confusing. I just don’t know what should I do first?
Signal	I have no idea why this is happening. What is the science behind it? So basically, I've been drinking to fall asleep for the past several weeks. I'd get maybe 4-5 hours and I'd be okay with that. Sometimes I'd be able to fall back asleep. Lately I've been drinking the same amount and only being able to get 2 or 3 hours, and am pretty much incapable of falling back asleep. Fears of SFI have pretty much taken over and I'm convinced I'm going to die. I'm legitimately terrified.
NotSignal	When you smile, the nerves connected to your face fire and create neurotransmitters associated with feeling good and relaxed (serotonin) I have really bad anxiety and my mind would not stop at all and I’d be in a physical state of stress all night (heart racing, tight chest, etc). I learned about half smile through DBT a few weeks ago and had been doing it during the day and anxious thoughts would stop after smiling for a while. So I tried it at night and it actually made me fall asleep every night this week. And if I wake up, I do it over again. It’s true you can wire your brain to be anxious but you can also wire it the other way. We are not hardwired, hence the neuro plasticity of the brain. A healthy persons mind doesn’t go to negative thoughts when they’re trying to fall asleep. That’s why they naturally drift off. So by half smiling I simulate a healthy persons mind and eventually good thoughts come and eventually that drifts off to sleep. Sometimes I have to be smiling for a while but it sure as heck better than wrinkling your forehead and trying to force your eyes to close.I think this is one of those, don’t knock it until you’ve tried it thing. Just putting it out there. I have tried so many supplements, therapies, etc etc and I’m kinda amazed how simple yet effective this is. Also doing it during the day will Lower your overall stress levels which contribute to sleep too. Fake it till you make it as they say. tl;dr: smile while you sleep, it fires healthy neurotransmitters for sleep
NotSignal	Does anyone else’s anxiety shoot through the roof when they don’t fall asleep looking at their phone? It’s almost like a comfort blanket. Once you turn it off you feel alone with your thoughts. And your sleeplessness.
NotSignal	We spend many sleepless nights on this site. Why not start a chat room for all those that cannot sleep and just want to socialize in the middle of the night?
Signal	Hi, first post here. I’m a college student, and for the past 4-6 weeks I’ve been having difficulty falling asleep. It used to be just once every 1-2 months but now it’s every weekday. I’ll lay in bed around 12am and i’ll toss and turn until 1:30-2:00am when I have to wake up at 8am. The weird part is that this doesn’t happen on weekends (friday and saturday night) and it has never happened to me at home. It also started and has been getting worse when my roommate started snoring. I have tried melatonin, generic Zzzquil, cbd, and nyquil. Nothing helps me fall asleep at a normal time. All they do is increase my heart rate. Is there anything I should try or any tips on how to get over this? I’m assuming it’s some sort of anxiety related. I have been diagnosed with anxiety in the past. Not getting 7-8 hours of sleep makes me grumpy and sad in general so that hasn’t been helping. Thank you
NotSignal	Bit of a contrast here haha. Anyone else sometimes feel this way? I find when I'm sitting up in bed listening to music I just tend to stay listening until all hours of the night, perhaps because I'm sitting up rather than lying down with the head on the pillow
Signal	I only take it (50 mg) when I haven't slept well the night before in fear of having another night like that. It usually takes 30 minutes to an hour after I take it to fall asleep, and it does a good job at getting rid of my health paranoia so I can sleep. The next day however, I feel weird like light headed, and initially when I wake up my heart seems to beat faster for a bit. Does anyone else get this or something similar? It makes me not want to take it anymore.
Signal	I've been bad at sleeping since childhood, and I'm a strong night owl, but a few years ago I developed insanely bad chronic insomnia. Like Brad Pitt following me around level stuff. I have meds that sometimes work, but if I'm not so sleepy that I'm dropping my phone on my face, I don't sleep. Overall I'm a lot better than I was a few years ago when sleep deprivation was making me insane and I'd regularly go 3 or 4 days with no sleep. After years of lying in bed for long, agonizing hours without sleep, going out of my mind and trying every trick I've learned without success, I've actually developed a fear of trying to fall asleep. I think I'm just so terrified that I'll try and fail and I'll go through those days of hell being dangerously sleep deprived again.Currently, it's nearly 5am and my meds have certainly kicked in very noticeably, and if I could calm down enough to lie still with my eyes closed, I would likely fall asleep. But I'm not so sleepy that I CAN'T stay awake, so I lie here afraid instead.That's my story. It sucks. Does anyone out there have any idea what I'm talking about with this "sleep phobia" thing?
NotSignal	I came here to makeba decision should i like because every night im losing my sanity and my online class is like next month as you know we have have trouble sleeping but what if we sleep at day and be awake at night(Sorry if my english is bad lol)
Signal	I have been battling severe insomnia for the last 3 years. It started out of seemingly no where and without getting into too much detail, I simply stopped sleeping. After a long year of jumping medications my family doctor prescribed Seroquel for me to sleep which worked for over a year and allowed for me to get an entire 8 hours of sleep. I am now having somewhat major side effects from Serqouel and am being tapered off of it. This has not been an easy task and I've unfortunately been having to take a mixture of lower dosed Serouqel (to keep on track for tapering) in addition to a Klonopin AND Ambien. I am at a point where I'd really just like to find a long term solution but the GP I have been seeing has limited knowledge into the world of sleep and has done his best but each solution he's offered just hasn't quite fit the bill for the bigger picture.Please avoid any advice having to do with eliminating blue light prior to bed and practicing healthy bed-time ritual habits. I currently do all of these things in addition to tranquilizers and still often time have to take a mixture of seroquel and a benzodiazapine or z-drug. I am simply wondering if anyone has had more luck with a sleep specialist over a general practitioner.
NotSignal	Can someone tell me a useful free site or an app that really helps with sleep and mental health calm please?
NotSignal	Have slept two hours in total for the last two days.I'm tired and desperately want to to to sleep.I've almost fallen asleep two times, but I woke up the minute I had drifted into sleep.I have class early this morning and I want to die.
NotSignal	Hi i had a few hours of sleep last night and i have anxiety now that i might not be able to sleep and i have a long day waiting for me( work).. is it worth taking ambien try to get lucky with few hours of sleep so at least i won't go sleeplesssince it's recommended to have 7-8 hours?
NotSignal	As soon as the sun comes up i have no chance of falling asleep so i want to try a sleep mask but the ones I've tried squish my eyes and the bands give me migraines from squishing my head so an adjustable one would be great. Sorry for being so specific I'm running out of options. CBD is kinda helping my anxiety but not my sleeping so im looking for a stronger dosage or top ups like gum and cbd fizzy pop and i want medication to be my last resort because I already take so much for my asthma.
Signal	I've suffered from insomnia for as long as I can remember bc I've never felt safe in the house I've grown up in. I've been moved out for a year and it's still shit, I can't sleep without calming background music and even then it doesn't always work. I went without sleep tonight even tho I was already super tired yesterday. Messed up a date a bit then too.I don't know how I'm ever gonna be a functioning person when my body hates resting so much. I'm going to spend some time at a friend's place as well and I sleep even worse there bc his cats wake me up every fucking day at 6am, sometimes multiple times. I love his cats but I need my sleep more. Despite this struggling for my entire life, I've never really been treated for it. No medicine, no tips or smth, if these so called professionals can't even help me out, what does that mean for me?
Signal	I have been fighting insomnia for the past few years. I am tired af for the whole day, and when I go to bed, I am suddenly awake. I heard many tips how to handle this - no screens 1h before bed, meditation, cut out caffeine, do progressive muscle relaxation etc, but so far none of these helped. What about you? I am not looking for a thing that will cure my insomnia instantly, rather a small change or a habit that could help even a little.
NotSignal	I wake up during the night almost every night after a few hours of sleep. Is there any solution?
Signal	The past two days I’ve been unable to sleep, which is odd for me because usually I’m able to sleep good and hard.. I’ve gotten maybe 8 hours in a time span of two days and I’m struggling really hard. I work 12 hr shifts on nightshift at a hospital. Thankfully I’ve gotten on call for the past two nights, but I’m really struggling and stressed out. I’m so tired but my brain won’t shut up. I know my stress is probably causing the sleep issue in the first place, I just really need some tips and tricks. I’ve googled all I can google and I’ve tried a lot of different things. Thank you so much in advance. ❤️
NotSignal	Is it normal to well just not feel sleepy anymore, like I can yawn and stuff but I just don't feel the urge to sleep.Does anyone have the same issues?
NotSignal	This is day 3 of either no sleep or very fragmented sleep with no dreams yay
NotSignal	Those crazy dreamlike things that you see when your eyes are closed but you are still most certainly awake. Like waking dreams. Who else gets these? Lately I have been getting them every morning when trying to fall back asleep. I have many visions of people that I don't know talking, and I realize that this isn't real and that what they're saying makes no sense at all. I see horrible faces changing shape, I see psychiatrists writing out prescriptions that are just random words and I question why in the world I saw that. So I'm really interested. Who else experiences these and what do you see?
NotSignal	Hi everyone! I’ve had insomnia most of my life but since the quarantine started it’s been hitting me really bad. My mood is getting thrown off and my eyes are constantly on fire. Have never really tried any methods, so any advice would be awesome! Thank you guys very much! (:
NotSignal	It all started in September 2017 i was getting these weird sensations in my brain where I felt like this up and down motion sensation in my head like i was in a roller coaster this went on the whole day until I went to sleep the sensation would stop, and during this month I noticed that even though I would sleep, I wouldn’t feel refreshed at all, this went on for all of September, in the middle of October is when everything went bad, I was at at boling crap and I was feeling extra anxious and heartbeat was going extra fast so I asked my mom to take me to hospital cause I thought I was gonna have a heart attack, so when I got to the hospital I got even more anxious and my heart started speeding up even more and that’s when I panicked and I felt a electric shock sensation all over my both arms, and I was screaming in pain but doctors didn’t do anything cause they thought I had a psychiatric problem, after that episode hospital did a chest x ray and sent me home. After that episode a couple days later I felt my heart rate was a little faster than normal around 103 beats per minute at rest and I also noticed my hands were real sweaty after a month my heart was always over 100 bpm I had sweaty hands fluctuating high blood pressure electric shock sensation in my brain, and I would sleep 8 hours but I would never feel refreshed, this went on all of 2017, in 2018 my heart rate started getting faster re sting heart rate of 120 with the same symptoms of sweaty hands and electricshock sensations and not feeling refreshed when sleeping,and my heart rate would stay like that all day,this went on for all of 2018, in 2019 my heart rate was now at 140 resting heart rate all the time and I also had the sensation of being unbalanced when I walked ,this sensation would come and go ,and I also still had all the symptoms of 2018 in late 2019 I started having swallowing problems and had to consume nothing but thick liquids ,after about 4 months I found that I could swallow again and was eating everything again, now fast forward to 2020 I’m sleeping 4 hours a day with same symptoms of 2018 but now I’m starting to hallucinate and also I’m having trouble typing as I now have slight dysmetria and i also feel extremely sleepy all day and spend all day laying down in my bed feeling unrefreshed from sleep, I had my heart checked by ekg but everything comes back normal, now I’m waiting to do ultrasound in heart, I haven’t told doctor about sfi cause I’m scared to tell them but I think ima have to tell them now, I thought they would of figured out it was a brain disease but they don’t think it is, what should I do what other disease could I have? And no I haven’t done sleep study because I’m afraid I won’t be able to sleep at the sleep study place because sleep is already hard enough with 4 hours of sleep a day. What now ?
NotSignal	I have had trouble sleeping for over a year. I could not be able to go to sleep until 2 am. This is mostly due to stress because I am a student. However, this summer it has gotten better because I have been sleeping for a full 9 hours. Unfortunately, lately I have been waking at 3am and am fully awake and can't get back to sleep. This wouldn't be a problem except this means that I need to go to sleep way earlier. This is going to be a problem when school starts because I don't think I can operate on only 4 hours of sleep. Based on some of the posts on here I seems like a lot of people have it way worse. However, I was wondering if anyone has had this sort of reverse insomnia and whether they were able to fix it?
NotSignal	Last night j got zero sleep, I have work right now which is terrible but I couldn't figure out why I couldn't sleep, I don't have any stress or anything and was constantly playing brown noise to help me sleep. What are some other ways to wall asleep eadier!?
Signal	I have to go to school in a few hours and I haven’t slept at all. I feel upset and anxious. How can I get myself to function during the day like this. This insomnia has been going on for days and I can’t do anything about it.ㅁ
Signal	I suffered from a terrible insomnia not too long ago, when on average I was sleeping only every other night. Since then, I posted here how I overcame it with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. But I wanted to write a more general post to help people navigate their insomnia and find the cure. So, if you want to end your insomnia without drugs, this post may be helpful for you. When my insomnia was starting about year ago, this subreddit was the first resource I found. I wish someone wrote a similar post when back then. It would save me so much time and struggles.So, how do we fall asleep and why may have troubles with it? Sleep is a natural phenomenon. It does not require any conscious effort. That’s why we FALL asleep, we don’t FORCE sleep, we don’t ACHIEVE sleep at will. In fact, any effort you put into sleep will backfire and will make sleep more difficult. So, if sleep is a natural thing, why is it such a trouble for some people? That’s because sleep is easily disturbed. While we can not force sleep, we unfortunately can make it difficult by our sleep-related behavior, worries and thoughts. So if you have chronic insomnia, the only thing that stands between you and a good sleep is you. And you can change it.Before going any further, I need to make a remark here. Sometimes insomnia can be caused by some particular factors, like chronic pain and life-related stress, or sleep apnea. In that case, primary cause needs to be addressed for sleep to return. However, if you used to sleep normally, and then you accidentally had few bad nights or multiple bad nights which caused you to doubt your ability to sleep and made you anxious about your sleep, made you think a lot about sleep, then your insomnia is fueled by your sleep-related thoughts, worries and behavior. By addressing your thoughts, worries and behavior you can return to normal sleep pattern.Another remark. I had sleep onset insomnia (hard time falling asleep). But both therapies that I go over work for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (waking up too early, unable to fall back to sleep). Waking up in the middle of the night is normal. We sleep in cycles and sometimes wake up between them, but usually don't remember that. So waking up at night is normal. Question is how you react to that. So if you have sleep maintenance insomnia, this post may be helpful for you as well.About drugs. Obviously, we want to solve our problems right away. It would be great to just take a pill and drift off. However, no drug generates sleep. Sleep is natural ability of your body. Sleep pills will not send you to sleep, if you take them during the day, when you are not sleepy and hence not ready for sleep. What pills can do is they can make you more relaxed and then sleep will maybe happen. However, all drugs have side effects and they stop being effective after some time, forcing you to search for a new solution. They only way out is to address your sleep-related thoughts, worries and behavior so you can sleep naturally again, every night. How can you achieve this?There are two interventions that are effective:1. CBTI (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia)2. ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy). It was ACT that stopped my insomnia, but I will go over CBTI first, since it is more famous approach and they say it works faster.CBTI includes some basic sleep education to explain you that sleep is a natural phenomenon that does not require any actions or any conscious effort. When you’ve been awake long enough and feel sleepy, sleep will happen if can stay calm and relaxed in your bed. That last part about being calm and relaxed is the major challenge if you have a lot of negative experience about being in bed. This issue is addressed through two core components of CBTI: sleep restriction and stimulus control. These are terrible names that don’t reflect the essence of the methods. Sleep restriction (should rather be called bed time restriction) is not meant to reduce amount of sleep, it reduces amount of time you spend in bed. By allowing yourself to be in bed only during a particular sleep window, you allow your body to generate sufficient sleepiness making sleep more likely. A typical mistake of people with insomnia is they often go to bed too early, hoping to increase their chance of getting more sleep. However, you need to be sleepy for sleep, and the only thing that generates sleepiness is wakefulness. You need to awake long enough (\~16-18 hours for most people) to accumulate sufficient sleep drive.It is very important to distinguish sleepiness from general tiredness. If you have insomnia, you often spend you days feeling generally tired, fatigued, you have headaches. But is it not sleepiness. Even when feeling tired, you will not fall asleep if not sleepy. To understand the difference, imagine you ran a marathon. You will feel very tired after that, but not sleepy. You will not fall asleep at the finish line, just because you are very tired. Because always feeling fatigued and having a foggy mind, people with insomnia start to forget what it is like to feel genuinely sleepy and not just foggy and fatigued. By allotting a limited amount of time in bed during your sleep window and not allowing yourself to spend too much time in bed you generate sleepiness (heavy eyes, difficulty staying awake) and you increase your chance of sleeping well through your sleep window.Second core component of CBT is stimulus control: if you are in bed and can not fall asleep for about 30 minutes, you should leave your bed and go do some non-stimulating relaxing activity, until you feel relaxed and sleepy again to return to bed. They idea is to break association between bed and wakefulness.It is very important (many exclamation marks) that you follow these two core components strictly. CBTI is a therapy and you are in the process of healing you sleep. If you find yourself awake in bed, unable to fall asleep/fall back to sleep within \~30 minutes and start tossing and turning and being in bed becomes unpleasant, you should leave your bed, so you don’t reinforce association between bed and wakefulness.Another important thing to know is that the therapy does not seek to send you to sleep right this night. It is a long term behavioral therapy, that seeks to re-establish association between bed and rest: the only thing you should do in bed is sleep. By allotting appropriate amount of time in bed and not spending much time in bed awake tossing and turning, you re-learn that your bed is a place for sleep. You develop this idea, that you don’t have to be in bed stressing about your sleep. You can always leave your bedroom and stop anxiety to return when you feel more relaxed. By developing this idea, you return your normal sleep in the long term, but maybe not this particular night.Third thing to know is that CBTI can be grueling, especially in the beginning. It is better to work with caring and supportive professional. I spent a lot time of the forum of insomniacoach site (Google insomniacoach Martin Reed). The site is run by a sleep coach Martin Reed. People say he is very supportive and he cares. Please go to that website, listen to podcasts with CBTI practitioners and clients, watch insomniacoach videos on youtube. Watch them all, they are helpful. You may want to contact Martin Reed or other CBTI professional from his podcasts to work with them. As you can learn from some discussions in the podcasts, CBTI can take weeks to work: weeks of limited sleep window and religious getting-out-of-bed-if-can’t-fall-asleep practice. It is hard to go through without professional support. Supportive and caring professional can make a difference. Ignorant practitioner will ruin it and leave you frustrated with the idea, that you have to live with insomnia for the rest of your life.I did try sleep restriction without knowing these things and not surprisingly it didn’t work for me, only caused more stress and anxiety. Perhaps, I could stop my insomnia earlier with CBTI if I had more understanding at the time. So, I pursued another, less known approach: acceptance and commitment therapy for insomnia (ACT). ACT is described in by Dr Guy Meadows in his Sleep Book, available on Amazon. The inexpensive book is the best investment of my life.What is a difference between CBTI and ACT? CBTI works from outside-in: by limiting time in bed and generating strong sleep drive, you may start to sleep better and hence worry less about sleep, making sleep easier and progressively allowing yourself to spend more time in bed and eventually overcoming insomnia. ACT works inside-out: you directly face your sleep-related thoughts and worries, thus removing obstacles in the way of falling asleep without relying on increased sleep drive. The theory behind the approach is the following: while your worries and thoughts can make sleep more difficult, it is mainly your REACTION to your thoughts and worries that mostly fuels your insomnia. By fighting you worries, by trying actively to calm yourself and to push worries away, by trying to shut off your mind, you are doing too much of mental work, incompatible with rest and sleep. While you can not suppress built-in reactions of your body (like fast beating heart, when lying in bed), you can stop fighting them and be a passive observer of your feelings, urges and thoughts. By choosing to accept the presence of these unpleasant feelings, urges and thoughts and do nothing to remove them, you make sleep much more likely to happen. Acceptance does not mean you have to like anxious feelings, you just admit that they are present and you choose not do anything to get rid of them. By learning to do so, you explain your mind, that there is no real danger and there no problems that need to be solved right now, and your body will reward with good night sleep. ACT is based on mindfulness, which will teach you how to defuse from your worries, thoughts, feelings and urges, so you can passively observe instead of fighting.Importantly, although ACT does not seek to build a strong sleep drive, like sleep restriction, your sleep schedule needs to be reasonable. Sleep will only happen if you are sleepy and ready for sleep. If you used to go to bed around 11 pm before insomnia, there is no point of going to bed at 9 pm hoping to catch more sleep. Chances are, you will not sleep right away, which will make you frustrated and anxious, making sleep more difficult. Be reasonable with your sleep window. Don’t lie in after a bad night. If you got up at 10 am today, it will be very difficult for you to sleep, if you go to bed around 11 pm today. The only thing that generates sleepiness is wakefulness.One more thing, that can help some people to overcome their insomnia faster. You might read all of the above and say: hey, I don’t feel anxious in bed, and I still can’t fall asleep for hours, why? Chances are you are trying to fall asleep too hard: as Dr Guy Meadows explains in his book, normal sleepers are completely OK about being awake, they don’t try to force sleep, but they simply allow sleep to happen. When you struggle with sleep, you start actively waiting for sleep to happen, you are desiring sleep badly. Without realizing it, you are trying to force sleep upon yourself. You can feel it by self-monitoring. Chances are you are gently forcing sleep and actively monitoring for sleep status, keeping you mind active. Solution? Defuse from sleep desire, from sleep expectation. Be a passive observer of your desire to be asleep without being caught in it. You will learn it with ACT.Some people will overcome their insomnia after reading the book. While looking back, I realize that the Sleep Book (by Guy Meadows) has all the tools available. However, I did also have couple Skype sessions with an ACT professional (Google thesleepschool mindfulness or Somnia mindufulness).Hopefully, this post will be helpful for some people. Remember, sleep is a natural process and can not become broken. However, you worries and mental effort you put into sleep can disturb sleep. When you re-learn to be calm in bed and be completely ok about being awake in bed, you sleep will return. Good luck.
Signal	I picked up a new job doing overnights at a warehouse. I get desperately sleepy in the middle of my shift, but invariably, when I get home, I have all the energy in the world. Sometimes I take a nap, but mostly I make coffee and sit up with the tv and food until my body physically cannot continue. I used to be able to get six hours more or less every night, but alas! No more! Currently, it is 7AM 5/6, and the last time I slept was 2PM-6PM 5/4. When I die of chronic exhaustion, I'm gonna have to have a stern talk with god about this nonsense.
NotSignal	I’m PMSing and every time I do, my insomnia gets worse and I’m almost incapable of sleeping at all!!
NotSignal	The rare occurrence that I can sleep through the night and the rarer occurrence that I actually have dreams that are memorable, I frequently dream that I can not for the life of me keep my eyes open. I will be driving or I have to walk somewhere and my eyelids just feel incredibly heavy and I can't keep them open at all.I asked my buddy and he said he's never had a dream like that before and suggested it may be an insomniac thing.Have any of you had an experience like this?
Signal	So I have HPPD, (hallucinogenic perception persisting disorder, for those who aren’t aware, basically its permanent acid trip). And I had insomnia before, but now it’s impossible to sleep without having an intense sedative. For me currently it’s drinks, but I’m developing a bad habit. Basically, if anyone has any idea of some extra fucking strength sleep meds please recommend. IE; Melatonin at any strength hasn’t worked, I can pop 4 Benadryl and still be awake. I guess I have a tolerance. But in any case, any inquiries or advice would be wonderful!
NotSignal	28F. I have been waking up in the middle of the night for the last week and cannot get back to sleep again for a few hours. Then I wake up again a couple hours later and go through my whole day in a fog. This happens regularly and I’m starting to suspect it’s tied to PMS/hormone fluctuations. Does anybody else experience this? Are there any remedies that help you stay asleep through the night during the week or two before your cycle starts?
Signal	So for the past few days My schedule has been messed up... I fall asleep around noon and sleep til around 11 at night. Woke up a few hours ago with a migraine. It’s now 9:33am.... if I sleep today I’ll mess up again.. someone help...
NotSignal	There’s nothing more frustrating than doing alright for a bit with sleep then going straight back down the rabbit hole. I gave up on sleep since it’s 6:40 and the sun is already lighting my room up. Haven’t really slept much/well this past week and it’s starting to wear on me. Hope if you’re reading this you can get some better sleep than me.
Signal	I can't sleep, obviously. Diagnosed with insomnia, I received a 100mg prescription for seroquel like 2 months ago, and it knocked me out on my ass more than any sleeping medicine I've ever tried, but I'm out of refills.I've been off the seroquel for a couple weeks now, going to sleep at around 1-3 AM every night and I have a 9-5 job. I need to take the bus to work, especially lately because I just put a lot of money aside for the new house me and my gf's family are moving into, and I can't really afford to take uber's.&#x200B;I need to leave the house by 9:30 AM to make the bus and make it to work by 11. I always set my alarm for 7:30 and for 8:00 AM and I NEVER wake up to them. I was very good at waking up and leaving at first, but now I can't wake up, no matter how hard I try or want to, and I miss the bus and have to get an uber.&#x200B;I've always had trouble getting up on time, but this is my first full time job, and the first job that I really enjoy, and want to keep. How do you fellow insomniacs wake up at 6 AM or 7 AM when only getting like 3-5 hours of sleep? It's mesmerizing to me.
NotSignal	By taking a shitload of ayurvedic and other natural meds I finally slept like a baby. Before bed time i consumed Nutmeg powder in warm milk, almonds, Brahmidrakshadi Kashayam, Ashwagandharishtam, Tagara (Indian Valerian), manasamitra vatakam and tart cherry juice. I eat one meal a day (consisting of multigrain grain oatmeal, broccoli, ash gourd juice, egg whites and fish). Started nofap & yoga (hundred sets of surya namaskar early morning). Also started using ayurvedic eye drops which burn the shit out of my eyes ironically relaxing them. I hope I continue to sleep like this and unfollow this sub soon!
NotSignal	I thought my insomnia was gone, so yesterday I slept @ 5am I feel asleep like usual for the last few weeks then I woke up @ around 6:20 and couldn’t fall back asleep I’m awake with 1 hour of sleep and Idk what to do imma sleep @10pm today see if that fixes anything but Idk if my insomnia back or this a one time thing, I’m getting stressed that I won’t sleep , so any advice?
Signal	Does your insomnia worsen when experiencing a psychotic episode/ your psychosis intensifies ?Currently 2.36AM for me. In the early evening, I started seeing lights and 'glitches in reality'. Fell asleep for maybe an hour, and now can't sleep. My hallucinations are reassembling those after taking ecstasy/ that time I overdosed on benzydamine. Oh, this sucks. This sucks really bad.
NotSignal	I normally feel a little tired around 12 30, but have a ton of energy at 1ish, and I'm not tired till at least 4. I'm often on my phone so that might be the cause, but even when I'm not I don't feel tired and just feel like I have uncontainable energy
Signal	My sleeplessness and restlessness is getting worse, and I’m starting to feel anxious about going to bed because I know I’ll struggle. Does anyone else feel like this?
NotSignal	Guys, i do not know how to survive. I am 13 but still can only sleep about 3 hours of sleep every night. My parents told me that I would grow over it when I was 9 but it has not happened. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome that and sleep(other than drugs)? any help is appreciated. thanks
NotSignal	I’ve woken up at 7-8 every day no matter what time I go to bed, and I can’t fall back asleep. To make it worse I physically cannot fall asleep until at least 3, no matter how tired I am. My body refuses to nap either. It got so bad that I even started hallucinating a bit. But today, I did my usual wake up at 8 and lay there for a bit, but this time I actually managed to fall asleep and got about 8 hours in total. I’m really happy even if I have a bad headache now. Wondering if anyone else has this same problem.
NotSignal	Is that safe? I can not sleep with just two
Signal	The sun is up, and I am still awake. I didn’t sleep a wink last night. Hell, I didn’t even get a chance to toss and turn... no I was just up. Wide awake, pacing around my apartment. I am so tired that my body physically hurts. My eyes hurt... everything hurts. The sun is up and this is the second night that I hadn’t slept. I don’t even remember what 8 hours of sleep feels like. I don’t remember what 4 hours of sleep feels like anymore. My mind was is in a constant state of fog and haze. I am just tired.
Signal	I tried so many sleep meds and nothing works for me. Ambien wouldn’t even touch insomia, at times it would put me to sleep for an hour or two but then I’ll wake up feeling worst. I also tried benzos but overtime they seem to make things worst. Xyrem seems pretty promising, has anybody here tried it with any amount of success? Thanks for your responses
Signal	Hi all,I'm new to this subreddit. I never had trouble sleeping my entire life. No matter how tired or not tired I was on a given night, I would be able to fall asleep in 10 minutes easily. However, last Wednesday, I was anxious about summer school stuff, and I couldn't sleep until 4 hours after I got in bed. My sleep schedule is already screwed up since the summer (Sleep around 3 am and wake up around 10 am). That night I couldn't sleep until 7 am and woke up around 2 pm. Even though I got 7 hours of sleep I still felt really tired. I thought to myself, "Ok maybe just a bad night of sleep. Tonight will be fine." But when I got in bed the next night I was anxious that I wouldn't be able to sleep again, so I couldn't sleep until 6 am. This has continued to the point that now, I dread going to bed fearing another frustrating night trying to sleep. I feel like my brain has associated my bed with sleeplessness and frustration instead of relaxation. Has anyone experienced this? Even though I manage to get 6-7 hours of sleep each night ever since last Wednesday, I still wake up feeling shitty the next day, and my brain is slow. Crazy how things can change so fast. I miss the days when I loved sleeping and I didn't have to force myself to go to sleep. I might try sleeping in another room tonight to see if that helps. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Signal	I will probably be jinxing myself heavily and have a restless night of sleep after posting this but it's worth it as long as I help somebody out. Although I occasionally had entire nights without sleep, what was more common to happen to me was falling asleep, then waking up around 3 AM and not being able to fall asleep again, or being awake till 6 AM then passing out due to exhaustion (both equally dangerous if you work 9 to 5).I finally realized I had two types of anxiety that were really bothering me. Sunrise anxiety and alarm anxiety. I'll keep it to the point and provide a list of the stuff I bought. I believe all of this helped me.1. blackout curtains (block most outside light)2. white noise machine (block sudden outside sounds that can alert you compared to sleeping in silence)3. phillips sunrise alarm clock (greatly cures alarm anxiety of sudden noise and sudden wakeup, wakes you up slowly)4. blindfold (blackout curtains help but aren't enough sometimes)Here's how I used the blindfold. At first I try to sleep normally. If I'm having trouble or wake up in the night I immediately put on my blindfold and focus on the white noise. The key of the blindfold is to block out whatever light is coming through the blackout curtain and get rid of sunrise anxiety, else I was still getting anxious anticipated the sun rising which was causing me not to fall asleep.If the blindfold is uncomfortable you can position it in a way where it only covers around 25% of your eyes without really feeling it and combined with the blackout curtains it will be enough for it to zone you out.Also *NEVER* look at the clock. Ever. Clock watching will destroy you as well. Silence that phone, do not look at it under any circumstance. If you're 100% awake and restless just chill with your blindfold on and lie there. I found that "getting up" and waiting to be sleepy didn't help me at all. But just chilling there and NOT having sunrise or alarm anxiety eventually made me fall asleep, no matter how little it was. I also read a book for around 30 mins before sleeping and find myself yawning like crazy. A good john grisham will do that to you. No technology at least 45 mins before bed if you combine me brushing my teeth, setting the bed and reading.I've literally gone from averaging 3-4 hours of sleep a night to around 6-7 and my mental health and overall positivity as increased greatly. I still wake up and am awake for an hour or two a night but it beats the hell I was going through before. I understand that this won't help everyone but I'm confident it will help at least one person on here so I want to share. Thanks everyone.
NotSignal	Just had another bad night, about 4 hours. Last time this happened I had a panic attack at work. I left my laptop at work and I have mandatory training so I have to go. Scared that I will lose my mind.
NotSignal	When I’m alone I can stay up all night trying to fall asleep but as soon as I’m with my boyfriend or friends I can pass out on any couch watching a movie or doing anything in a matter of minutes. Does anyone else experience this? Any ideas how to deal with it? It clearly has something to do with being alone vs accompanied by literally anyone but it’s impossible for me to be spending all the nights with someone.
NotSignal	So... Hi everybody,I have been reading through this subreddit for a while now. And I finally decided to create an account to share some of my experiences and questions. I apologize in advance for any mistakes and/or things that are unclear. it's my first reddit post ever. And I am not an native english speaker. (Im dutch).With all of that out of the way, there are some things that are bothering me. I don't exactly know what I want to achieve with this post. Answers? Reassurance? People telling me "hey dude. Its okay. You are not alone. It will get better." I don't know. I just need to vent and throw it all out somewhere. Usually sharing or talking with someone calms me down just enough to get some normal sleep. Anyways. I am a 28 yr old guy. And for as long as I can remember, my sleep schedule is totally out of whack. But I never had any real issues. I mean. During high school times I could easily play video games untill 4 or 5 AM. Crash for like 2 hours before getting up and go to school. Night after night after night. Sure. I was tired during the day. But I didnt make a big deal out of it. Few years later, around the time I got my first appartment. I started falling into a depression. I'm an ex self harmer. Spend years in therapy and still suffer from bouts of depression. But this is not the subreddit for that. So I will stick to the sleeping part. Around that time I started to accept the importance of sleep. Maybe spending half the night playing videogames and eating junkfood isn't such a great idea. Maybe I should fill my nights with sleep instead. So my entire sleeping pattern was out of whack again. Around this time I would fall asleep around 7AM and wake up at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. Not that great of an idea. Especially during the winter. You wake up at 3 in the afternoon. Just in time to see the sun go down... Yippie...So. Fast forwarding to recent times and the real reason im writing this. I eventually got it right. A proper sleep pattern. Still. No 8 or 9 hours a night. But a steady 5 or 6. Falling asleep at night and waking up in the morning. Im so proud of myself. But still. Not everything is as it should be. And this the part where Im looking for answers. I manage to fall asleep every night. There hasnt been a single night in my life where I went with 0 hours of sleep. Even during some of the worst nights of my life, I still manage to fit in at least an hour or 2. Currently my sleep pattern looks like this. 2 or 3 weeks with normal sleep. Not a single problem. I manage to fall asleep without too much troubles. And every few weeks, I hit a dead end and I crash. 1, 2 sometimes even 3 nights with almost no sleep at all. Nothing is different. Everything is exactly the same during the day and evening. I watch the same shows on TV. Eat the same food. Go to bed at the same time. No videogames. No junkfood before bed. The only difference is, that sleep won't come. I lay there. Iook at the clock. I wait some more. 2AM. 3AM. 4... 5... 6... Etc. No sleep. Except for maybe some short naps. You know. Like 10 mins here. 20 mins there. But still no more than an hour combined. This usually resolves itself after a few days. And in no time I will be sleeping again. Until I hit another brick wall. Crash again. And the cycle repeats itself all over again. Now... This is the thing. The real problem. Everytime I have such and episode. I start to get completely paranoid. Not in the "I gotta get outta here because they are coming to get me and my tinfoil hat isnt working" kind of way. But in the I keep scaring myself kind of way. Things start rolling through my mind. I keep scaring myself. What if this will be the first night without any sleep at all? What if I lost the abillity to sleep and I will never fall asleep again? I need to sleep. I dont wanna die. What if this and what if that. You get the point. And I keep saying to myself "dont panic. There is nothing to worry about. You are making an ass of yourself. You always manage to sleep. Why should this time be any different?". And thats just the thing. These thoughts are completely bogus. Nothing is wrong. It will resolve itself. But still. It's currently 6 AM where I live and its looking like this will be the first night for me. without any sleep at all. Im a grown ass man damnit. My questions. 1. Is this sleep anxiety? Because everytime a night like this happens, I keep getting weird symptoms. Sweating. A scared gut feeling as soon as i close my eyes. Restlessness etc. I keep pushing myself to fall asleep. Its not really the sleep itself im scared of. No crazy nightmares or anything like that. But I do have to confess that sometimes I am scared of falling asleep. You know. When the switch gets flipped from awake to asleep. Which is also completely bogus. Because you can't experience that. Because when you fall asleep, you arent conscious. When is the last time you remembered the exact moment you fell asleep? You just do it. One moment you lay in bed. And the other moment you look at the clock and you realize you have been asleep for the past 3 or 4 hours.2. Is it bad for you, if you go a night without any sleep at all? I do realize that people can start to hallucinate (another thing im terrified of) and eventually die from a lack of sleep. But 1 night? Come on... Right? 3. Any people that can relate?4. Any tips against anxiety?Maybe I should contact my psychiatrist again.Sorry if this is way too much info. Or if this isn't the right place to post something like this. I don't really know what I want to achieve with this message. Some tips maybe? Maybe some recognition. Usually it helps big time when I talk about this. I talk with someone and WHAM! Knocked out. Last time I posted a something similar like this on a different forum and not even an hour after that, I fell asleep. And I do realize that I might be making a big deal out of nothing. And there are people out there and on this subreddit, that have waaaaay worse problems than me. So I don't mind if you laugh at me or something like that. I haven't had the best life so far. I am a pretty lonely guy. With only a few close friends. And I just needed some place to write down all of my thoughts. I dunno... Pretty sure that in an hour or 2, I will be sleeping again. And after I wake up and again can think with a clear mind, I will be kicking myself in the head for posting such stupid things... Anyways. Thanks for staying with me. And Good night... Morning...? Day...?
NotSignal	It's 4 in the morning and I just cant fall asleep. All this quarantine, online classes, and pandemic have made me lose sleep. I just want all this to be over.
NotSignal	Before you start make sure you have the following A cold room A dark room Step 1: Lie on your back and put your arms next to your sides Breath in through your nose for 5 seconds whilst doing that tighten your forhead and jaw then once 5 seconds are up exhale for 5 seconds through your mouth. Do the same with your face cheeks then after do your nose and tongue breath in for 5 seconds once done exhale for 5 seconds. Now do the same with your shoulders, arms butt and legs aswell as your feet. Step 2: Breathe in through your nose and out deeply through your mouth for about 15 times Step 3: Breath in for 4 seconds hold your breath for 7 seconds and exhale for 8 seconds do this for 5 times Step 4: Now lie whatever side you want right or left and focus on your breath and count from 300 backwards You should now be in a sleep and not even remember once you hit 1 Please let me know if this works for you I myself struggled with sleep and once I did this it’s been working ever since and yes I did copy my own post from sleep sub reddit but I want to help you guys out
NotSignal	Hey wondering if anyone has trouble falling back asleep after being woken up or just waking up and being wide awake unable to fall back asleep.
Signal	Its 8:30am right now. I suffer from anxiety and my main symptom is this.I close my eyes as im falling asleep. My chest feels a bit tight and i suddenly sweat a lot.My breathing slows tremendouslyIm now shaking and just took 7mg approx of remeron (mirtazapine)Im gonna record myself sleeping via snorelabs. Im super confident that im feeling abnormal symptomsI think its apnea of some sortIm absolutely shitting myself. Im in no pain with the chest tightness it just feels like im being hugged tightly. Scared... so fucking scared.
Signal	Because that’s all I can manage, and it is horrible, I don’t understand how some people can just fall asleep. I don’t even feel refreshed when I finish, I feel the same as I did 6 hours before.
NotSignal	How do i stop believing that i won't sleep in the next night.Hi I slept very long today and somehow i believe that i will not sleep because of it.I slept for the last two weeks very good and i improved alot, but i believe and i'm afraid that it will fall down.
NotSignal	I usually sleep like a log when I come home after drinking a few beers with my pals, but then comes the dreaded hangover. In the past, that has meant that I’m so tired during the dat that I usually sleep even better come sunday night.However, the last two times that I’ve been drinking on a saturday – the night to monday has been absolutely terrible with like zero sleep at all.Is this something you’ve experienced? I’ve tried googling it but I only find people asking about sleep the same night as they’ve been drinking, but that’s not my problem.Maybe it’s just the common ”sunday night anxiety” intensified by the hangover that’s been bugging me on these two occasions?Asking because my pals want to go to a bar tomorrow but I’m kind of considering going sober for a while because of this lol.
Signal	After 2 days with no sleep i really felt like killing myself, i thought that i was completely crazy and my life has no meaning. I have it after not sleeping and it sucks. How do i cope with it?
Signal	I’ve seen many people talk about their depression causing them insomnia, but I haven’t seen many speak about bipolar depression. I have bipolar 2 which results in my bipolar depression and anxiety (although my anxiety has gotten much better).I’ve found myself in this cycle where I’m always tired and want/have to take naps throughout the day but when it comes time to sleep, I don’t actually sleep. I have no problem falling asleep; the problem is staying asleep for more than 4-5 hours. My mind is also very awake and results in me feeling unrested and exhausted. I would like to hear if anyone else has experienced this regardless if they’re bipolar or not and anything they did that helped them. I have been on sleep medications in the past but they interfered with my day to day life and mental health so I had to discontinue them after talking with my therapist.
Signal	Hi my insomnia has been on and off i haven't had a this bad insomnia since two weeks ago I haven't slept this whole week I've been given some sleeping pills those don't help I take magnesium that's a hit and miss I lay in bed for hours trying to sleep I feel so terrible I do take THC with CBD in the afternoon I'm not sure if taking it at night would help. I've also tried to drink alcohol a few hours before bed it doesn't really help either. Does anyone have any suggestions please and thank you!
NotSignal	Two friend of mine(35 and 28 m) kept saying. Oh, you only have insomnia because you don’t exercise enough. Because you are sedentary.I’m sure if you go to the gym you won’t need to take any medicine to adhd or sleep medicine.FUCK YOU IGNORANTS. I hate these ppl who thinks exercising solves everyone’ s problems. This makes me so mad man.I’m going to the gym atm. Only 1-2 weeks. It didn’t change a shit.
Signal	So I have a few questions about insomnia because I’m getting a little concerned. I have never had problems sleeping in the past (some sleep apnea, but only due to being overweight which is no longer and issue) nor have I had problems falling asleep. I regularly slept 8-10 hours a night and have never had a problem doing so unless I was purposely trying to stay awake.It started 4 nights ago, I laid down at around 10 and had my phone put down by 10:30 to go to sleep. I literally tossed and turned for 8 hours unable to fall asleep. If anything I would be almost asleep and it was weird because it’s like I was starting to have a dream, almost like a vivid day dream but then my body would snap back awake and be super uncomfortable. The next two nights went like this. In 3 days I got maybe 2-3 hours of “sleep” if you want to call it that. So now up to yesterday, I have never truly experienced the symptoms of sleep deprivation before. I thought I knew what tired was, I was wrong. Yesterday I was basically stumbling through my day like I had a constant buzz, almost as if I had been 3-4 beers in. My dexterity was shot, vision would not focus correctly on things that I was reading, absolutely zero attention span, etc. I started to leave the house the go the park to clear my head but I drove for about 3 minutes and turned right back around because it felt like I was about to drive drunk. Last night I could not wait to lay down to go to bed. I was the most mentally and physically drained I think I have ever been in my life and thought there was absolutely no way my body could keep me awake this time. I didn’t want to take any chances though so at around 8:30 I took 3 Benadryl and a couple melatonin to make sure my ass was OUT all night. I probably fell asleep around 9:30 but then woke back up at 12. Here I am now laying here at 4am again, on the verge of a fucking mental breakdown because I’m so tired and I can not fall back asleep. Please, any thoughts or advice would be incredibly welcomed at this point.Just as a little bit of extra info I don’t do or take anything stimulating that would be doing this to me. I don’t drink pop, coffee, I eat relatively clean, and work out. There’s not been any sudden change in my life to cause an influx of stress and honestly I haven’t felt very stressed anyway. I have absolutely no clue how this hit me out of nowhere but I have got to get something figured out because I’m on the verge of tears from how frustrating it is to be this tired but unable to fall asleep.
Signal	It’s gonna be a long night.. but that’s life I guess. I have a question for mirtazapine users. Have any of you felt like it made your memory suck any? I seem to have days when I can barely remember things I did earlier that day or even then day before, or I’ll suddenly forget names of stuff. Even on days I sleep alright, my memory still sucks.
Signal	I've been having this issue since Christmas eve. When i fall asleep i usually end up waking up from a dream and then i cant fall back to sleep. From what I've deduced i sleep about two hours per night and its really exhausting. I self supplement with magnesium vitamins and avoid any blue light 1 hour before bed. In the day i exercise and meditate. Have any of you had this type of experience or have any tips on staying asleep.
NotSignal	as if falling asleep isn’t hard enough, let’s add some electronics to the mix...I have one of those light bulbs in the bedroom that you can pair with whoever... “alexa, turn on the bedroom light”.well mr. mclightylight decides ten minutes after I finally conk out, to randomly start strobing. at 4:00am. it was like a damn ambulance was in here! AND it was completely unresponsive to the app/alexa. I had to get up and turn off the light switch.grrrr.
NotSignal	I've recently been dealing with some stuff lately and ever since i had one extremely important and stressful exam, and the night of the exam i was unable to sleep, since then I've been falling asleep at 6-7am even if i do my best to stay away whole day, i just end up being awake for 24+ hours and fall asleep at 6am. I've been sleeping for around 5h. All in all, I cant fall asleep at night, but ive got no problem falling asleep in the morning and sleeping for a few hours. Is my sleep schedule just messed up, and can i return back to normal or is this actually insomnia? This is not the first time I'm experiencing this kind of sleep schedule/behaviour, it also happened during summer exams in August.
Signal	Hi. I've been taking 10mg zolpediem, nightly, for the past 3 years. (And on and off, for the 3 years before that.) I've tried stopping before, and the only withdrawal symptom is poor sleep, for 2 weeks, before I refilled the rx and went back on it. I'm not sleeping well now even with the ambien, anymore, so I'm going to taper off and stop again...anyone have experience in how long it might take to get somewhat normal sleep back again? I'm prepared for as many weeks as it takes to get off this stuff. thanks!
NotSignal	For me personally, I have trouble both falling asleep and staying asleep; every time I wake up at like 8 am (I don’t fall asleep until like 5 am or so), when I open my eyes it feels super easy to open; like my sleep doesn’t feel refreshing at all and I can’t hit that deep rem sleep :(. Anyone else feel the same?
NotSignal	Before, my general consensus was that nothing otc was going to be helpful at all, that you’d practically have to knock me out; nothing otc is that useful for insomnia. Granted, there are still days where your brain is the primary issue where insomnia is a bigger, more behavioral concern, but my main experience has been just not ever feeling tired enough to shut off. So after trying TONS of different things, what makes me fall asleep is:---*Somnapure*- it’s way too expensive and I got a bunch on sale. Not sure what I’ll do once it’s out because it’s pretty crazy expensive. It contains 500mg valerian extract, 300mg lemon balm extract, 200mg L-Theanine, 120mg Hops extract, 50mg chamomile extract, 50mg Passion flower extract, and 3mg melatonin. Serving size is 2 pills, I take 3. They smell like feet; valerian root always smells like feet so that’s what I expected. The amazon reviews are over dramatic about the smell. I also take 75mg of Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Whichever is cheapest. it’s sold for allergies and for sleep and for some reason the prices are all over. I bought 300+ of them for about $20.Idk how sustainable this is, but I’ve been falling asleep and having to actually **give in** to being tired where normally I have to trick my brain into it and wake up feeling like I’d never slept. I know you all might have tried similar things. In the past I’ve tried things like melatonin, valerian, Benadryl, etc. without a ton of success, but something about this combination knocks me out and I’ve consistently not had any trouble sleeping ever since I bought the stuff. I figured I’d share because I know how much it sucks and how pointless it sounds normally when people ask if you’ve tried melatonin.
NotSignal	Hi, so lately I've been very depressed and trying to work on each area of my life one by one. I feel like my lack of sleep has a huge contribution to the rest of my issues and is one of the core roots of my daily struggles. So I decided to see my doctor about sleep.I told him I keep all distractions away from my bed. I go to sleep at the same time every night. I meditate before hand and avoid any screen time for at least an hour before bed. I take three 5mg melatonin about 15mins before bed. My mattress is very comfortable. I turn off every single light to make it as dark as possible. And through all of this, it takes me roughly 3-4 hours of lying there till I can finally fall asleep. I go to bed around 1am, and try to wake up for 9:30am as I work a full time job 1pm-10pm. Every night I struggle to sleep, I sleep in well past my alarm, waking up several times through the night. I have terrible headaches all day long when my sleep is below 5 hours (I'm getting about 5 hours average)I was diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist and told my doctor that my mind races and I fill with energy at night. But apparently to him I have no sleep issues and I just need to work on a better night time routine.I'm wondering if I should keep trying to get some sort of medication? Or is there some secret trick to knock me out at night when I want to sleep?Any help is appreciated!
Signal	I don't know what to do anymore. My therapist told me with the stress I have it's normal that I have insomnia. I always had it since I was 13 (am now 22) but these days it's really bad. I either sleep 2 or less hours or not at all. I tried pills, hypnosis, tea, etc. I can't take prescription sleeping pills because it would have a bad reaction with other medication I have to take. Does anyone have an idea what else I can do? I do sports to exhaust my body, but it's not my body that can't sleep. It's my mind. :/ Thank you to everyone responding! Also sorry if it's difficult to understand, English isn't my first language :/
Signal	I've never been a good sleeper. I started taking Tylenol pm in college. Started ambien like 14 years ago. Since then have cycled through numerous meds. Either they don't work at all or I build up a tolerance and have to keep increasing my dosage. But it seems like the tolerance issue happens so fast. I do crazy shit on ambien so that's a no go. Restoril works if I triple my dose. I can't find a Dr to take me seriously and always get treated like a drug seeker. I just don't know what to do anymore.
Signal	So, I've had chronic sleep issues my whole life. I was never formally diagnosed but after seeing several physiologists in a wide range of fields they all say i probably have insomnia. I know this, my parents know this and we're on the same page on that aspect.Issue is, they don't understand that i cant just lay down and fall asleep in 20-30 minutes. I get bored after an hour and then my head starts spiraling thinking about a billion different things until its 7 am and i have to get up anyways. Often in these spirals a lot of darker subjects pop in my brain such as intense dysphoria, stress and suicidal thoughts. I dont want to let myself spiral so when it gets out of hand I'll do anything to occupy my mind.My parents, mum in particular have an issue with me being awake while she isnt and gets mad at me when im not face down in a pillow at 5 am. She gets livid at me when i decide to do anything computer related as she thinks all this life long chronic sleep issues are caused by computer usage when i for months at a time wouldn't use anything for hours before bed and nothing changed and all professionals said the issue was not that.I have confronted her on all of this and she simply doesn't care to listen. She won't listen to professional advice and not to her own child. How, if there is any way, can i help her to understand i cant just fall asleep like she can.
Signal	17f here. so i fell asleep around 10 pm last night and have been awake since 3 am it's now 6 am. no signs of falling back to sleep. I work the next 5 days then get my wisdom teeth pulled. maybe the drugs will help me get a good nights rest LMAO.
NotSignal	On hot sunny days like today, I wish that the day would never end. Everyone’s happy and I enjoy to spend time with my family & friends as well as doing my things. When the sun goes down I start to feel anxious, because everyone will go to sleep in a few hours and i’ll toss and turn for hours before falling asleep. Is it just me? haha
NotSignal	Hi All,I've had an issue where I've had sleep maintenance issues for a while (I used to be a normal sleeper prior to this a few years ago) and I can go to sleep relatively fine, but mostly wake up after 3-5 hours. I find it incredibly difficult to go back to sleep upon waking.Few months ago, I undertook a sleep study overnight at a clinic because I got so fed up. I didn't have any sleep apnea but only a few mild hypopneas which weren't too concerning for my sleep doctor.This doesn't conclude why I have maintenance issues, but I'd like to know if this was a similar case to other people in my shoes and how to best remedy it?He mentioned physical add-ons that would reinforce side sleeping rather than back sleeping. Last resort would be CPAP and surgery. I am not too obese, but I could shed few kilos at my height.Let me know what you guys think! A big part of the maintennce issues could just be primary insomnia and a psychological aspect..(and yes CBT-I)
NotSignal	Hello,I have a situation that I'm not sure what the problem is. So I can usually fall asleep pretty quickly (with 30 mins) but then around the 5-6 hour mark I usually wake up. Then go back to sleep and then wake up like an hour later, then maybe fall asleep and wake up like half an hour later. You get the gist. When I wake up I usually have some sort of thoughts running in my head almost has if i had been dreaming them or thinking about them when I woke up. It's kinda trippy. This made me think that oh I have anxiety issues and its making it hard for my brain to turn off. I have taken amitriptyline in the past which is a TCA that helps with anxiety and i have been able to sleep better (eg continuous for 7 hours) but it makes me super groggy. I also don't have anxiety in the day to day, like I get anxious but I'm able to control without taking pills. On the other hand sometimes when I wake up during my sleep I have to pee which I find weird and after looking up online I found it can be indicative of sleep apnea. Although I always thought in sleep apnea you dont even realize that you're awake bc when I wake up after 5-6 hours of sleep i am conscious. And falling back to sleep has its own difficulties so I just wanted to ask if anyone experienced something similar to me or has some insight. Is my problem to get a breathing device for sleep apena or is it more related to anxiety.
NotSignal	So. When people are bipolar they swing, right? Mania or depression. You’re either so high and happy you can go for days without sleep or food and make really crappy choices that you think don’t matter like spending lots of money, or gambling, or thinking you need to contact everyone you know or whatever. When you’re down, you’re so down you can’t get out of bed for long stretches and might sleep and catch up and eat non stop or something.When you have complex ptsd and your trauma is rooted in your childhood, you have permanent brain damage and it fucks up your circadian rhythm. You’ve been so scared since you were a little kid of falling asleep and being caught of guard. Someone could rip the pillow out from under your head or abuse you in your sleep.Or when you finally feel safe enough to fall asleep because you’re with someone you trust, one person you really love and know would never hurt you, you have a nightmare. Or sleep paralysis. Or a seizure.Let’s say you finally fall asleep, thank God, on your own in after 72 hours, you have a seizure, and vomit, and urinate, but you’re so exhausted and out of it because you’re posticaland covered in your own vomit and urine and trying to undress and clean yourself and the couch and youresocoldandshiveringand now-you-are-falling-asleep-againasyou...are walking.ggg yourewalking walkginggg. You are sleep walking into the corner of a wall. You fall on the ground. Your mother finds you the next morning.It’s your 36th birthday.You finally fell asleep for more than a few hours. Your mum finds you on the bare, hard wood floor half naked and helpless, almost as you came to her.Helpless. Pathetic. Unable to fend for yourself. “Oh, my God!!!”That’s the sound that wakes you up. She helps you to the bathroom. You’re still out of it.“What happened,’oh my poor baby,” your mother cries. She’s a retired nurse. She sits you on the toilet. She strips the vomit covered shirt from you. The bathroom fills with warm steam as she quickly gathers supplies to clean you. You’re still half asleep, and as you yawn two things happen: you taste the puke in your mouth and wonder what the fuck happened. Then you see the blood: it’s everywhere. You’re covered in it. You smell like urine. Your right eye is closed. Your mother begins to dab at it with a warm wash cloth. You grab her hand and look up.“I’m so sorry, Mom,” you begin to cry on your 36th birthday.She tells you not to be sorry. She tells you it’s going to be okay. She cries some and tries to hide her face. For twenty years now, everytime something happens like this, she’s the only one that ever understands. Or she knows it’s not your fault. She’s the one to hold your hand. She’s the one the doesn’t care that none of it makes sense.I have a black eye for a long time. I have a laceration that needs a few stitches. I probably have a concussion, but I don’t care anymore.The seizures continue, the nightmares continue. Still sleep walking, always one foot in a dream wondering if the other is in the actual real world realm. A few weeks later, the new neurologist asks if you went to urgent care or the hospital after the incident on your birthday.“Neither.”He looks at you funny.“You know you probably had a concussion right?” he says concerned.“.....yep.”36 wasn’t so bad
Signal	The titles kind of self explanatory. I'm looking for something that will help me fall asleep but not cause significant weight gain. I had been on Seroquel in the past and it was great but it made me ravenously hungry right after I took it. Needless to say, since I started taking it I probably gained 15-20 pounds. I should also mention that I have ibs, and a lot of other medications will cause stomach distress. Really just looking for suggestions on between my next psychiatrist appt.
NotSignal	Seems like impossible, i'm terribly sleepy right now and i close my eyes pretty easily, im afraid i might fall asleep in the progress....
Signal	Normally i cant sleep. Ill try but nothing works. In fact my doc gave me remeron. A drug used for depression but it also makes you sleepy, and he increased the dose. And it still make me sleepy. An do finally he increased it and said it probably wouldn’t make me sleepy. It normally acts like a stimulant (keeps you up. Not wired) at higher doeses. But it still made me sleepy. I took it in the morning as he suggested and i slept all day. Now sometimes i take too much. Like 200 mg when im really stressed and want to self harm. Its a way of self harming. But it stopped working. So i started sleeping every other day so that i could actually fall asleep at 2100 hrs and that messed me up a little but ive recovered. I just cant sleep and i dont know what to do
NotSignal	I just want to chat I think I have insomnia I regularly stay up till 3am just bored and lonely.
Signal	Tuesday night (7/28) I could no fall asleep until 1 AM. I went to bed at 9:30 PM. I’ve had random nights of not great sleep before from too much stimulation before bed or just restless mind. However the following night as I was laying in bed I couldn’t sleep and was getting restless. As I began to get increasingly restless I got increasingly anxious and eventually fell asleep at 5 AM.I wake up every morning at 6AM for work at 7AM.The following day, Thursday, I actually began to get anxious of going to bed because I didn’t want the cycle to continue. Well it did, and I finally could account for some sleep at about 2:30 AM.Friday (yesterday) I’m legit dreading going to bed because I’m nervous for the anxiousness. I had a long day of work and didn’t get out until 11 PM and was actually feeling really tired and was initially optimistic. I even read a book before bed to cleanse my mind and I took some Benadryl to add some drowsiness. After 30-60mins of laying down it set it. My wife even played a meditative YouTube video for me in bed but to no avail. I Ended up finally falling asleep around maybe 3:30.What’s going on here? Will this pass? I’ll take any advice anyone has to offer. I’m seriously scared as hell at this point.P.S. I’m not trying to appear as if my situation is worse than other folks, I’m sure some people experience this way worse or frequently than me.
Signal	Forgive the semi phallic title, but it isIts so hard to keep tryingIts so hard to just accept this as a part of my lifeEvery night for the past 2 months, 6 hoursEvery night for the past month, 5 hoursEvery night for the past week, 3-4 hours.Im at my limit. Everything is becoming harder to handle. I just want a miracle cure.I tried fixing my schedule by going around the clock. Instead I was hit with multiple nights of insomnia, and now my schedule is erreatic with no rhyme or reason as to when I go to bed and get up.I just want a normal life. I want to sleep like everyone else does. I weaned myself off my sleeping meds at the beginning of the year. I was so proud of myself. Now im back to taking them again with no idea whether they will work or not, every night is a coin toss, just like before.This may sound pathetic, but many years ago I tried to kill myself because of my insomnia. Im still paying off the bills, so I cant afford something like that again. I really dont want to die anymore anyway, that was a combination of many factors that the insomnia and not sleeping for many days made much worse. But im afraid im drawing closer to that point again. I dont want to go back to that dark place. I really dont. I'd do anything. But nothing works. Nothing changes. I tried to change my worldview about it, just accepting it, but after multiple weeks. Multiple months. Its hard. Its hard to keep fighting through. Im sorry, i just wanted to vent. I was here back then in my dark days, and im back here now, 3 years older. Its painful, and I think I just want to yell out to people who understand, just a bit.
NotSignal	It’s weird, I used to have troubling falling asleep until around 5-6 am ish.. and a couple weeks ago i started taking sleeping pills. But now for some reason i just don’t want to take them and even if i do i force myself up with my thoughts and anxiety, so now it’s led to me falling asleep anywhere around 10 am to even the afternoon. Not to mention, the amount of sleep i’ve been getting has been steadily decreasing, now basically i wake up after like 3-4 hours of sleep. Because of this issue, it’s led to me eating only one meal a day, and i blacked out recently while walking up the stairs... Is this because of the sleeping pills, or is it just my mental health getting worse. It’s pretty frustrating, now my family has noticed my sleeping problems due to not eating, and they constantly yell at me because i don’t sleep or eat regularly.
Signal	Forgive me if this post is unwanted, but I've been told I'm an insomniac by some although I'm reluctant to believe it, I guess I don't want to. About every other night I black out into a light sleep for an hour or 2 and that's pretty much the sleep I get until i crash every 5 days or so. I do struggle with sleeping but it's not like I can't sleep, if I really wanted too I'd be able to get maybe 4-5 hours of sleep a night. I just don't really want to sleep. Being tired all the time is sucky and difficult but being fully awake and aware is worse to me, when I'm tired time goes by faster and I don't have the attention span or energy to really think logically and things just happen. I just make choices and I space out until the next interaction. No thinking about the future or what I've done in my past it's simply existing in that moment in time. Sorry I went off topic a bit but, am I an insomniac?
NotSignal	I havent since last april and I'm wondering if that's due to chronic insomnia I used to dream vividly. Also to the ppl who wake up 5 or so times a night how do you fix that ugh
NotSignal	I'm either awake for days on end, or I'm having entirely vivid nightmares about explicit murder and graphic death scenes. Oh yeah! Sleep paralysis too! Why is my relationship with sleep so bad??? Why can't I be at peace?
Signal	I have my first appointment tomorrow morning with a sleep doctor. They think my lack of sleep and insomnia could be related to my seizures and tremors. Is there any tips anyone can give that I leave with a script for some medication. Particularly clonazepam, or ambien. Really don’t want to leave with something shitty like Trazodone which I’ve already tried but knowing my luck he’ll probably just tell me to take more Benadryl.
NotSignal	I mean honestly how fast can one become dependent on sleeping pills if I only have taken them for a week... I mean it helps keep me asleep when I wake from a nightmare... but last night for some reason I didn’t take it...
Signal	I go to bed, tired and ready to sleep. Then, my mind goes into high activity, I keep on thinking 4x as quick, loops of songs playing twice the speed stuck in my head for hours! It's like someone had 25 tabs on their browser and played something from all of them at the same time. I just lay in bed for 6-8 hours, sometimes I manage to get a couple hours of sleep, sometimes no. If I have trouble sleeping, which is every night, I get really frustrated and panic. During the day I am tired and have low-energy, then the cycle restarts.
Signal	Hi. In the last year I’ve been on several sleep agents. Most recently, I’d been using 10mg Ambien. I love it for knocking me out but unfortunately, I never slept more than 5hrs. Last week I switched to Ambien CR. Again, I still can’t sleep more than 5hrs and it leaves me a little groggier. My doctor said if Ambien CR didn’t work, we could try Lunesta. Anyone have these experiences, but Lunesta worked to keep them asleep for longer? Any positive or negative Lunesta experiences for insomnia? Thanks y’all!
Signal	Then, it just stopped working. Despite, always taking it on an empty stomach. I wonder it the GI problems I’ve been having kinda prevent it from being as effective. It kinda still makes me a little tired? Not enough to shut my brain off thoughI used to take trazodone for sleep, and that used to be super effective until I had anxiety about bedtime. (which I’m trying to fix)I kinda want to quit ambien and go back on trazodone, but I take paxil in the morning idk about the interactions with thatAlso side note, I’ve been getting only 4-5 hours of sleep a night I cherish that amount of sleep but I feel miserable with headaches
NotSignal	Does anyone feels good in their own bed and room, but when it comes to staying in some hotels or staying overnight in someone elses house they just cant sleep?
Signal	Is this normal? I’ll be so exhausted and suddenly my mind goes sharper, feel More energetic, awake and just unstable? Is this part of having severe insomnia?
Signal	Could this mean my body is catching up. I keep falling back asleep. I don’t know if it was exactly a week but it was around that time for like 4 days i had to take trazodone cause i was getting only 2 hours of sleep without it. I get these periods im guessing due to my bipolar nos when i have bad insomnia for a couple days..
NotSignal	The best part is that one of family members suffered from insomnia herself.If I have lights turned on during night -> "she's fucked up"If I'm not able to think straight because I slept 5 hours in total during last two days but I'm able to sit behind a computer -> "YoU cAn'T dO a HoMeWoRk bUt YoU cAn PlAy CoMpUtEr GaMeS" (And no, I'm not able to play games and I'm forcing myself to even write this text)"just lay down and close your eyes" takes the fucking cake.
NotSignal	Are weighted blankets really that helpful? Apparently it's suppose to help one calm down? Or sumn? I just want a night where I can actually go to sleep instead of looking up at a ceiling for 5 hours and then proceeding to give up on sleeping bc school starts in 1 hour and ya might as well just not sleep...
Signal	[Sorry for poor writing, my brain is barely working]Im 16 and male. Ive had minor sleep problems for as long as I can remember that never got worse than missing one nights sleep but currently I am amidst the first time where I am concerned for my health. The affects are so bad that things such as talking to someone is hard cause I stutter horribly and can't properly form full sentences, I have to read the same thing sometimes 6 times before i comprehend it. My vision is blurry and there are distortions like static objects appearing to move and no sense of depth. I can hear doors opening or somebody calling my name when nobody was there. My whole body is in crippling pain and its all getting worse by the moment. The first night was just being unable to get comfortable enough and became more severe the more tired I get. Now if i lay down everything is unbearably uncomfortable and I cant turn my head off. I dont know what to do and I can only pray that once I get sleep this doesnt reoccur
Signal	Anyone here prescribed a benzodiazepine(xanax,klonopin, Ativan, Valium, halcion, restoril) on a long term regular basis for sleep? What about ambien? TIAEdit: does anyone else get restless legs from many common sleep aid like Benadryl, melatonin or rx meds like quetiapine or trazadone? EVERYTHING does it for me
NotSignal	Dear elusive sleep,Can you please hug me? And let me feel the warmth,Inside your gentle arms. -Tossing, turning, I'm defeated.Now discovered, so demeaning. All these hours, inside my head, Voices screaming in the back. -Here I lie, all curled up, Awaiting you, to make it stop.Daunting sounds, to remind me of the ones I've left behind. -Fleeting grace, you really show,Above my face, you kindly float. Awake again, and now I know-The peace isn't going to last.No more than a small grasp, Of something I can never have.
NotSignal	I used antidepressants for 7 years, I don't have any genetic illness, just had rough childhood. I started seeing doctor when I was 14. My doctor told me to quit medication when I was 21, then I continued seeing therapist until I was 23, I'm 24 now. Somehow, I keep waking myself up whenever I'm going in to deep sleep. I get really sleepy between 23-00 o'clock and when I go to bed, I feel melatonin flowing through my blood. But just as I'm going into deep sleep, it's like something sparks in me, waking me up, pulling me back from that deep sleep state, saying "No, you can't sleep". Then I usually get a headache if I stay in bed. I can only sleep after 4 AM, when I can't feel anything anymore. I see the same pattern when I'm seeing a nightmare. When my dream starts to turn into a nightmare, I notice that and somehow I wake myself up before shit hit the fan. I always thought that my mind is full of thought that preventing me to sleep, but behind everything else, this is the real problem I guess. I don't feel like doctors can help me anymore, I'm sure they don't have any idea about what's going on either.
Signal	Considering just staying up until 5 in the morning, going to work super early, then going home at 2pm and sleeping.My insomnia has been terrible all of last month and it's making me late for work every morn
Signal	I took one and don’t feel tired, might need to take another. Does anybody here have experience with taking 100mg?
NotSignal	I do sleep at around 12:00 mid night .. but wake up frequently in between to pee.. like 2 or 3 times. At day time I don’t have increased frequency or urgency. In night , I drink a glass of water at 10 but still why do I have to wake up so frequently? I have not been able to sleep sound for 2 weeks now :((
NotSignal	It's 6 AM and I'm struggling to get some sleep. Adding to that, my roomate is a bear. I had to buy some earplugs for that matter. There used to be a time when I felt like sleeping is a waste of time but now I can't even get some. I took pill last week, it worked but I don't want myself to depend on them. Would it work if I skip sleep for today?
NotSignal	Hello my dear night dwellers. As we all know, Insomnia is one hellish thing to befall a living thing. I’m sure most of us have been jealous of our dogs or cats. How easily they sleep, their minds still and tranquil. Us however, goddamn. Some of us might not have anxiety or depression, yet still we dwell in the night till the morning all the same. That’s exactly the point i’m about to make. Insomnia is one of the most mysterious and puzzling “illnesses” or conditions there is. There are no clear answers. Some people fix it by fixing their diet, some people have medical conditions, some mental. Some none of those. I know it’s hard to feel positive about this fucking condition. Trust me, it brought to the brink of suicide. I am much better now. However, my journey is not the same as yours. My body isn’t the same as yours, nor is my mind. We are all unique, yet us insomniacs share a lot of things in common as well. It took many many hours of studying insomnia, biology, diet, neuroscience, nutrition, pharmacology, self-help techniques, psychology, a bit of literature, the human microbiome, and believe it or not, Zen Buddhism & Meditation, to finally have an understanding of how to deal with my own insomnia. I’ve gotten it under control. However, I had to accept many changes I needed to make. Insomnia could be a journey to start discover yourself more deeply. Biologically, mentally, spiritually. I am not religious, I was born muslim and became and atheist in my teens. I still consider myself an atheist to some extent. But spirituality does have an impact on your mental state. So does your biology, your nutrition, your lifestyle, etc. Now the danger arises when you dismiss these topics on hand and think you already now them. I can’t stress this enough. Your mind will trick you into thinking you understand when you don’t. It will trick you into dismissing them. It will come up with any reason possible to avoid introspection and come up with excuses to not read more and change yourself. Do not trust your mind. Do not trust your thoughts. Trust your intuition. Trust direct experience. This you can rely on. Learn things and then directly experience them and see what happens. Many of you will intuitively know that this makes sense. Obviously you still need your mind to read and think and remember, but you get the idea. It will take maybe two years for you to filter out the good information from the bad. To see what lifestyle change works and what doesn’t. You need to keep an open mind, and you need to start to proactively learn things. Be consistent in your lifestyle changes. Not just try something for a week and say “Fuck that it didn’t work that’s bullshit.” That thinking right there is bullshit. Learning=change. Behavioral or psychological. If you read that stress induces insomnia but you don’t do anything to change your stress level, then you haven’t actually learned. You just memorized a fact. You will be amazed by how many things you didn’t expect to have an influence on sleep that do. “The greatest enemy of knowledge isn’t ignorance, It is the illusion of knowledge.” -Stephen HawkingMany people know that gut bacteria influence your mood and sleep. So they google how to increase gut bacteria. They get an article saying that probiotics increase it. They buy probiotics. Try it. Feel nothing. Then say ok well it’s not my gut bacteria. When in reality, probiotics alone don’t help that much at all. This is just one out of a million examples. Insomnia isn’t your fault. It’s the worst thing to be told that it’s “just in your mind”. In a sense it is true, but all of us have very little control of our minds and bodies. I know it’s hard to be motivated when you are sleep deprived. Somedays when I lose sleep (rarely these days, maybe 5-6 days a month) I start to feel the same ways I felt before. Low energy, tired, want to give up on life. Just shitty overall. If you sleep better the day after, or whenever, get back into the journey. We can’t control our sleep, but we do have control on many things that can start to influence both our minds and bodies. Later on, your mind and body will be your friends, not your enemies. But that won’t come easily. Obviously you see how big of a subject this is. I can’t explain every trap and obstacle. This is your journey to make. Insomnia was the best thing to happen to me. I hope you will be able to say that about it in the future.
NotSignal	For the past week and a half im averaging about 6 hours of sleep a night. I can’t fall asleep until around 2:30am and ill wake up around 8:30. Once i wake up its hopeless to try and fall asleep, i feel like im going crazy
Signal	I always wake up after 1 hour of sleep, for example i slept at 9pm and i woke up at 10pm then i can't sleep again but i'm tired
Signal	Well I went to bed at 11:30 last night after being decently active and off of screens most of the day, popped like 6mg of melatonin, cleared my mind and got comfortable, and then laid there for six hours until I decided to just get up for the day. I have the occasional getting to sleep problems but usually the only problem I usually have is staying asleep. I feel like maybe this quarantine stuff has made it worse but I’m not stressed or anything my life is very simple right now. This is the second time this has happened since all of this quarantine stuff happened and I’ve found it really hard to fall asleep countless times. I spend time on my computer in my room but like I said yesterday I was active and outside all day and should’ve been ready to sleep. Idk any suggestions?
Signal	I’ve dealt with insomnia for decades. The severity of it ebbs and flows but it’s been an annoying consistent part of my life.One weird effect that I have a hard time describing is this feeling of tension. It comes on as I get frustrated about not being able to fall asleep. It’s mainly concentrated in my toes and I feel like I need to squeeze my toes opened and closed to relieve the tension. It also presents itself in my side. It makes my body uncomfortable and adds to the inability to rest the mind and body to fall asleep. Curious if anyone experiences this feeling and maybe can describe it better than me.I’m in a week long trend of barely sleeping. My mind is exhausted and I’m so frustrated.
Signal	So, for the last 8 months or so, since I moved to a new apartment Ive been struggling a bit with insomnia. Its mostly been when I had to go up early for work or trying to sleep after working a night shift but now its on my spare time too which is a lot worse. What made it worse was that I tried to make me more used to going up early and I slept fairly well in the beginning but I wasnt able to sleep during the time frame that my goal was. I usually went to bed a bit later and woke up later than I wanted. It made me sleep fairly well though and my week at work after that was probably the best one Ive had despite the schedule being poor. The problem was that I were unable to sleep during the time frame that I actually wanted so I tried to force myself to sleep during that window but it didnt work and after a lot of poor nights I decided to stop it and just sleep like before. So I felt that I had to recover by getting extra sleep and despite having a lot of poor nights I wasnt able to fall asleep despite going to bed later and that seem to have triggered insomnia that I have to deal with every night now.I think I mentally went from being worried about not getting enough hours of sleep to being worried about not falling asleep. Im pretty anxious now when Im about to go to sleep and when Im trying to sleep Im having this weird vibration feelings from time to time in different body parts. It seems like there is more saliva being produced that I have to deal with and I also tend to get sweats after thinking about insomnia when laying in bed and I wake up pretty often sweaty during the night.Ive tried for a shorter time with different relaxation techniques but nothing of that seems to help very well. Its like I cant focus on the exercise and my mind just starts thinking about other stuff during it. It feels like Im getting more anxious when doing it. My mind is in general very active and Im never really relaxed during the day either.The things Ive tried myself is relaxation techniques, supplements, eating more carbs, dark chocolate and drinking milk. Im also currently trying to get up earlier than Im used to and going to bed a bit later than Im used to but it just makes me have a lot trouble falling asleep which often makes me sleep longer than I want. I exercise almost every day too. Since I cant take medication then it feels like Ive tried most of the recommended things and nothing seems to be helping so any other tips would be appreciated.
NotSignal	Does anyone have brain zaps but not because you’re off medication? You just have it? It’s like I’m about to fall asleep and then it just zaps for a second.
NotSignal	Searched the posts here and only one from 2 years ago. Just curious...
Signal	Hello all, I need some guidance or recommendations to try next. I have had sleeping problems every since my father passed away while I was in Jr High. I always use to take melatonin, Zzzquil , Advil PM, etc etc. which ended up getting to a point of abusing them. I have been taking hydroxyzine pam for the past month and they don’t seem to be working. I gave it some time to try and get used to it and nope. Anything you guys would recommend? I see my doctor this Thursday.
Signal	One year ago, I was a happy, creative, 12 year old boy with hope for a bright future. It all started last Christmas with Type A Flu where I couldn't sleep due to my symptoms and I went on about 4 hours a night for 2 weeks. After that, my schedule returned a little bit going to school, but I was having at least 2 nights a week of terrible sleep. Now, it's almost every night where I'm awake until 3am. I've tried a lot. I know that for me it's worry now - but I have no idea how to fix that. There's no way I can stop it - I can try thinking of "happy thoughts" but I'll always have my insomnia thoughts. It didn't affect me too much then, but now it's taking over my life. I've lost my creative drive and some days I'm so brain dead and exhausted that I can't do anything. I follow all sleep hygiene. I've tried what feels like everything, even CBT. It just feels like a pit, that I can't escape and I also have a permanent cold so I'm always so run down and always sneezing. The Lockdown has really turned this extreme.
Signal	Hello everyone,I've been going through a problem over the past few days where I'll typically try to go to sleep at around 1 AM. This often leads to me struggling to fall asleep because I'm not feeling sleepy and when I do manage to fall asleep, I can normally only sleep for around 4-5 hours and I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. I tried staying up a bit later last night but even as late as 3 AM I get the same results. Should I stay up later to try and find out when I fall asleep naturally or should I pull an all nighter to try and fix what time I get sleepy?I would appreciate any advice, I'm feeling really frustrated because these problems seem so sudden since I've normally always been able to fall asleep easily.
Signal	Have anyone ever tried to sleep but has only been able to rest, but end up feeling fine once you have to wake up and do stuff? Has anyone ever had a couple hours of sleep but then woke up to feel as if you didn't sleep at all? Just a couple of days ago I had four hours of rest but couldn't get to sleep, but I woke up and was completely fine! Then the next day I had around the same amount of rest, but instead of just resting all night I was able to have an hour or so of sleep, yet I felt more tired than when I woke up the day before! What's up with that lol.
NotSignal	I want to say I've never gone to a doctor, and have not been diagnosed with insomnia. For those who struggle, it must be so exhausting, and I don't want to come in here and be like "juSt gO to sLeEp". So take this more as something that MIGHT help people sleep better, absolutely not cure insomnia. These are barely tips, most likely things you've already heard before and the furthest thing from revolutionary. I'm pretty sure my sleeplessness was due to anxiety over going to sleep, and beginning to fear never falling asleep. Here are some things that helped me: Making sure everything is perfect. Although it might not be the cause of your sleeplessness, when you're sleeping poorly it's easy to get woken up by small things. Essentially, make sure that anything that might bother you is taken care of. Have a glass of water by your bed, go to pee before, get earplugs for noise, get blinds to block out light, get rid of your uncomfortable pillow, etc. Go to bed early. Might be contradictory to other advice but basically if you also have anxiety about going to sleep and not getting any sleep, it might help you because it gives you longer amount of time to fall asleep, so you don't feel as stressed over not sleeping. Don't look at the time efter a certain time. Again, to lower the stress of thinking about how little sleep you're going to get. Don't watch anything intense before going to bed, don't do work/schoolwork if possible. Might sound ridiculous but for me sometimes if I watch or read or do something remotely intense before going to bed it stays on my mind, the same thing with studying. I swear I've gotten in arguments online before going to sleep and not been able to sleep because of it. Do something creative/write before going to sleep. Can be a diary, or anything, but creative writing is nice! When I can't sleep, rather than overthinking, it's like my brain is super empty and I'm really aware of the emptiness. Writing before bed helps my mind drift and distract itself from the fact that I'm trying to fall asleep, as I'm so absorbed in my stories. And lastly, I don't know if this is a tip, but I often see people joking about "juSt liE doWn anD close YoUr eyEs" and that you're supposed to get out of bed if you can't sleep. But for me, I literally need to force myself to lie down and close my eyes to ever be able to sleep. Otherwise I toss and turn, get up, do other stuff, etc. I used to only be able to pass out towards morning because that is when I was tired enough to not do anything but lie there. Might absolutely not work for you, but just lying down, not focusing on falling asleep but rather focusing on resting and being comfortable is nice. If I'm too energetic, I'll sit up with my eyes open and just try to be comfortable. In my case the chances of me falling asleep are higher that way rather than reading a book or something similar. I hope anyone who reads this is able to fall asleep soon. If you're here because you're anxious about not getting sleep, your body wants sleep and still knows how to sleep, and it'll happen eventually, you'll be okay. :))
Signal	i had a rhinoplasty 3 days ago and since then have only had a total of 2 hours of sleep (within 2 days). it’s scaring me so much because my heart rate will be normal then the minute i try to sleep it goes up so high and i get hot flashes in my stomach and chest it’s almost like a burning feeling and i begin to freak out because nothing i do lowers my heart rate, i’m only 16 and have had ECGs and stuff but my anxiety is telling me that there’s something seriously wrong with me. i woke up with a fast beating heart. i just wanna sleep so bad i’m so sleep deprived has anyone felt this before
NotSignal	I was prescribed this FOR insomnia yet it seems to be making sleep harder after I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I've heard Trazadone and caffeine have bad interactions and I also think it's made my bowels funny as dumb as it may sound. Have any of you guys used this drug? I may be getting rid of it, as it's not healthy it seems.
NotSignal	So for background I'm a full time LPN student. The first semester kept me so busy I barely had time to breathe. So at night from learning and doing things and using my brain all day, I got the best sleep of my life. As soon as my head hit the pillow I was out. That went on for the whole semester! Now. We are on break until January 13th before second semester and I'm finding myself lying awake at night thinking of all the things I don't have to do. I'm not using my brain to constantly learn and study, so it feels like my body doesn't want to sleep. It's not like I sleep in at all or take naps during the day anyway. What do I do? Why does this happen?
NotSignal	I decided to make a Japanese sleep haiku because why not. Just in case you didn't know, the format is 5/7/5 syllable count made of three lines total. Sleep, do I know you? How I dream to dream in blissPlease, at least one kiss.
Signal	I want to cry every time I can’t fall asleep. I’ve taken melatonin and am still awake. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.As time goes by and I realize how many hours I have left to spare, I get so frustrated I want to cry. I have to be up in three hours. I was half-asleep for three hours, suddenly woke up, and haven’t been able to fall asleep for another four.I hate this lmao
NotSignal	I got like 4-5 hours MAX of sleep during school days during high school and middle school... can anyone else relate?
Signal	I’m sorry it’s late (but who isn’t up, right? So kinda long story, but please bare with me here. My mom died from lung cancer at 19 and my father at 26. This was very hard and I had started drinking to cope. Luckily, I am 4 YEARS SOBER. But my problem, is every doctor that I am seeing, has noticed my history of hospitalization from drinking, and defuse to prescribe a benzo or ambien. OTC doesn’t work. My question is, what can I differently to help my situation? I was always honest with doctors and maybe them hearing I was an alcoholic deterred them from helping me. Could I just not mention my history and say insomnia is literally making me delusional, and making my work performance diminish dramatically?I just want to sleep ):
Signal	my doctor suggested i could help resolve my insomnia if i stopped using anything with led lights at least 3 hours before bed. and i have no idea what to use, do you guys have any tips?
NotSignal	**when I told my co-worker that I got 5 hours of sleep with excitement. She responded with "sorry" and it hit me, in her world (which wasn't a walk in the park for different reasons) getting just 5 hours of sleep is a nightmare.**
NotSignal	I've been addicted to my phone lately and I am self sabatoging as a defense mechanism. I am NOT joking. Lost two weeks of REM sleep because of this. Don't want to do anything all day because of the depression and lack of motivation. I do nothing all day. I've been hospitalized but that stuff didn't fit for me and I didn't participate due to feeling hopeless. This hurts my family and friends. I feel selfish. I want to die but at the same time I don't. This isn't some ploy for attention. Just feel like i deserve this. Perhaps I'm an idiot...perhaps I'm not. They say you have to put in the work yourself to get better. That is true. But i find myself unmotivated to do so. One might of severe guilt and insomnia led to two weeks of an internet addiction and more sleepless nights. I feel like a moron. During COVID-19 of all times. Lost a lot of friendships due to unrelated reasons and had a tumultuous relationship. Treated people unfairly. Regret plagues me. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel like suicide is the only way out of this slump.
NotSignal	I can't fall asleep at night, when I do I toss and turn and have weird dreams and wake up constantly, I'm super restless and my bed just feels so uncomfortable, my room has a weird vibe, and my thoughts keep me awake. But in the daytime my bed feels like a cloud made of fluffy kittens and I can relax and fall asleep so peacefully, I don't even think, I just drift off and and when I wake up I fall back to sleep easily.
Signal	I just spoke to my therapist (=not my doctor) about my sleeping disorder. As any therapist would do, she complained about me taking so many meds at the moment (btw I think it’s still not enough). I know problem solving without meds is a lot better and I swear I haven’t taken one pill of lorazepam I didn’t desperately need. But why is it so hard for people to understand that ther can be in fact times when you almost completely rely on a medication to work?! I don’t choose this! I whish it was different! But I lost control and now I need help getting it back! Anybody made the same experience?
NotSignal	I suffered from insomnia after stopping a prescribed painkiller from this I developed severe sleep anxiety and would struggle to fall asleep. Randomly from around October 2019 I managed to sleep properly again and have been sleeping every night since with minimal issues however Tuesday night out of nowhere I just couldn’t sleep at all other then it being hot here atm I cannot put my finger on why - nothing in my life has changed, I am not going through any stresses etc every night since has been the same with the exception of last night where I took a sedating antihistamines and managed to get 4/5 hours of rubbish quality sleep!Has anyone experienced anything similar?Thanks in advance!
NotSignal	All throughout my life, I’ve never had too much of an issue sleeping, however, recently it’s been a struggle when it comes to sleeping. Every night this week, I’ve been feeling as if there’s someone or something there while my eyes are closed, and I open my eyes to see if there is, but no one is there. I feel as if the more I think about it and the more I talk about it, the more real it gets. I get scared whenever I feel as if there’s something there, it’s getting to a point where I try to focus on sounds such as my fan to move my focus,but it’s no use.
Signal	I used to have (and sometimes still have) insomnia badly just generally, but these days my sleep is just disturbed by my bladder. I try to avoid drinking anything before bed, I usually fall asleep about 1am .. and by 3am I’m woken by my bursting bladder. Up 2 flights of stairs to loo and then back to sleep. Then I’m woken again by a bursting bladder about 6 or 7am and after climbing 2 flights of stairs again, this disrupts my sleep enough that I generally can’t get back to sleep after that. So I’m getting about 5 hours sleep per night but the only issue is mostly my bladder. I feel like this can’t be normal? Is it?
NotSignal	How do you guys keep track of the hours? I get the first night. But after that the week turns into a blur. Hour here hour there sure but it's not enough to function. I forget words, names, simple tasks. I got this buddy now who just fills in my sentences as I go like it's his fucking job. I gave up my career so I could start taking meds. They gave me a script for everything but sleep. None of it really helped. I did like the anti depressant but world flip turned upside down now I can't afford to take em anymore. Gotta go back to work.
Signal	Ever since quarantine begun I haven't been sleeping right, and now my boyfriends brother is sick and we all share a bathroom. I get up like 2 or 3 times a night to use the rest room. I cant flipping pee or sleep and I have my period so that's just great. Also I take benadryl to help me sleep sometines but I'm afraid of becoming addicted to it.
NotSignal	My skin used to be glowing and dewey but since my insomnia's been getting worse and worse, it just looks really dull. I try to stay away from too many products, so currently I splash cold water on my face in the morning and rub in some Vit. C serum and argan oil. Some sunscreen too, if I'll be outside a lot. I don't wear makeup. At night I rise with hot water, then wash with a simple face bar, and will exfoliate every few days (I don't like to do it too much), and then rinse with cold water and follow with toner, serum, argan oil. If on any given night I get no sleep whatsoever, I'll exfoliate in the morning too. The exfoliating seems to do nothing in terms of helping the dullness. I try to drink plenty of water throughout the day but this only helps to a certain extent. Any tips?
NotSignal	I feel like I'm never ready to go to sleep no matter how sleep deprived I am, my body is simultaneously telling me it desperately needs sleep but doesn't want to actually go to sleep making it almost impossible to get the rest it needs.. anyone else dealing with this problem?
Signal	There was a post a little while ago that said this board was useless because the people who cured their insomnia usually don’t post here. Personally, it’s true that since I have been sleeping a bit better, I haven’t come here, so I wanted to rectify that. Anywoo, brief synopsis of my insomnia. I’ve always been a night owl, and that was manageable for the most part. Around three years ago, I suddenly started experiencing mid-night awakenings: wake up after about 4 hours of sleep and unable to fall back asleep. It could take me up to 4 more hours to feel sleepy again. I became anxious about these early awakenings because, like everybody else, I’d heard that not getting enough sleep was bad for the health. As a result of this anxiety, I now couldn’t even fall asleep to begin with. I went to see psychologists, psychiatrists, and doctors to get this insomnia resolved, and I tried a bunch of prescription meds to help me sleep: mirtazapine, trazodone, Seroquel, gabapentin, etc. The problem with these drugs is that, eventually, I would build a tolerance to them and they wouldn’t put me to sleep. The frustrating thing for me, is that I knew part of the issue was the anxiety over sleep was making it hard to sleep, but it felt like my body had now made it a habit to get anxious at night. I tried to fix my insomnia the “natural way”, with meditation, hypnosis, CBT-I ... I tried CBT-I on two occasions and both times, I failed: I just couldn’t last a month with four hours of sleep, which is what ended up happening with sleep restriction (I had 6 hours allotted to sleep, but I still woke up after about 4 hours of sleep).Last October, I saw a new sleep doctor. He wanted me to take Lunesta. After haggling with the insurance company for three months to pay for Lunesta, I was finally able to take it. But I was still having mid-night awakenings with Lunesta. So the sleep doctor referred me to a new psychiatrist who prescribed Lexapro because he said depression can disturb sleep, and then insomnia creates depression and it’s a vicious circle of insomnia and depression feeding each other. With the combination of Lexapro and Lunesta, I have not experienced early awakenings: I still sometimes wake up at night, but I fall right back to sleep. I would like to one day, not be dependent on drugs and to sleep like a normal person, but at least, I don’t feel like a crazy person anymore. I mean, I was so irritable and miserable during this 3 year ordeal, I felt like my “normal” personality was disappearing. So anyway, conclusion is: it took over two years to find doctors who didn’t mind prescribing separate medicine for sleep and depression, instead of trying to cure everything with just one pill. Now that I have medicine to help me sleep “normal”, I have to take another stab at CBT-i. So that’s my story so far.
Signal	So... I am getting a couple of hours of sleep every few days and when I do it is almost always followed by a sleep paralysis nightmare. I am tired and over the years this seems to keep getting worse. I have an appointment with psyche doc in 2 weeks and I am hoping I can finally get some nice sleep. Does anyone else experience the same thing?
NotSignal	It's 4am, due to commence work from home at 9am for my 8 hour work day. I'm stressing about a couple of things, and general Covid stuff, adjusting to working from home amidst home schooling interrupting anxious child. I feel like a few hours sleep will be worse than none at this point. I'll have to be available to work until 5pm regardless, but maybe I'll address the backlog? Or is this stupid sleep deprived brain talking?
Signal	I'm someone who's diagnosed with anxiety and have multiple family members with insomnia. I already made a post about this but it's gotten worse. I went bowling yesterday night and all I could do was think about sleep. I usually don't have insomnia and when I do it's not really that severe. The thing is the last 2 nights took me 1-2 hours to fall asleep does this last forever?
NotSignal	may sound weird but im happy about sleeping 4 hours without waking up lol, after that i slept another 1-2 hours maybe and im happy , back then it was 8 hours at once but ay better 4 than none lets be realwhat helps me vs cycling thoughts is: small walks at night time, lavender oil, beer(definetly.) and some teas &#x200B;just wanted to share my experiences :D
NotSignal	Getting some serious withdrawals from gabapentin and am wide awake. I work tomorrow at 7 am. I turn into a depressed motherfucker when I'm sleep deprived. Here it goes...down the abyss.
NotSignal	This will probably sound really dumb but i think the cause of my insomnia is actually a fear of the dark. Im terrified of the dark and to some extent im scared of sleeping/closing my eyes because im not in control of what happens to me...ive had such fears since i was a child so i always dread going to bed :< Am i the only one who feels like that? Today its especially bad though because the weathers rlly hot so i cant put on a blanket to 'protect' me, and i dont feel safe enough to sleep at all. Gosh, this sounds really really dumb
NotSignal	Nightmares.That's all I ever have. It's simply *nightmare* after mind-twisting, cold-sweat-inducing *nightmare* for the past few months, almost a year.Like just the other night, for example. I was kidnapped and everyone that I loved was there. I have a type of headgear that stays on the roof of my mouth but there's a small space between the material and my mouth that allows me to speak more clearly. When I tried to scream for help, my kidnappers stuffed clay in that pocket so I couldn't speak. I couldn't even scream when I saw a girl getting her mouth sewn shut. I was choking.The night before that, I dreamt that I had become an addict. Someone in my family has died from that. To make it even better, I was using the same drug that he was killed by. After a friend saved me from overdosing and took me to the hospital, I checked out hardly a day later and became a prostitute so I could buy more drugs.I've been hurt, humiliated, in mourning, rejected, and tortured in my dreams for years, but only in the past year has it gotten worse. The only time I can remember having a good dream was last year when I met my idol who had passed. He hugged me and told me something before he disappeared. That was when I was in a deep depression. I wish he'd come back.When I'm not asleep seeing whatever hellish nightmares my mind decides to concoct, I'm kept awake by my thoughts. Embarrassing moments that make me double-over, doubts about my self-worth, wondering if my friends love me, and scenarios that have made me sob, choking again.For God's sake, I'm fourteen years old and I'm terrified of sleeping for long periods of time. I'm stuck at home, I'm depressed, and it feels like I'm ready to pass out half the time but I'm too terrified to do so. It seems like even when I'm tired enough to sleep and I'm calm enough to do so, a small part of me is fighting it. I'm twisting and turning and it's always cold. I'm sorry for ranting and I'm sorry if it's stupid. I do hope that somehow y'all will be able to get a good night's sleep. Please, feel better soon. Sweet dreams. <3
NotSignal	Also, will I need to get a prescription from a doctor?
Signal	Ive been dealing with lack of sleep for almost 2 years maybe? But now its way worse than it ever was. Before it used to take max 2 hours to fall asleep, but now i stay awake the whole night. Its ruining my life i dont know what to do. I need to concentrate, i need my sleep im just 16. Please help me out I want to cry so much, im so irritated by this now. I look at the clock and just say fuck and get pissed off. Today particularly i somehow shut my mind up yet i still cant sleep now its almost 2 am and im pissed off. Like im sleepy, but i cant sleep
Signal	3:24 am right now but I know I won’t go to sleep until 10 am. It’s the same thing every day. I’m awake because I’m depressed, I feel lonely, and I’m honestly so lost. The insomnia is not getting better. I feel really tired during the day and I have no motivation to get anything done. I just want it to stop.
NotSignal	Hi guys I am after a second pair of a less “clunkier” blue filtering glasses.I have a UVEX one but I find it to be quite heavy like as if it’s those safety glasses and could do a pair that’s a bit more akin to wearing normal everyday specs. Any recommendations ?
NotSignal	I have a really hard time getting to sleep but lately when I do fall asleep I've been sleeping through all my alarms. I've been late for work twice now and I'm freaking out. I'm not sure if I should keep trying to sleep or just stay up so I'm not late again.
Signal	Background: hospitalised for 3 weeks due to covid19. 2 days ago I was getting really depressed about still testing positive and  having a really bad insomnia. Couldn’t sleep at 5 so I called the Nurses and the doctor prescribed me with Xanax. Yesterday night I didn’t take Xanax but I felt like I wasn’t in deep sleep. Kept dreaming and waking up through the night. 230 am now and I can’t sleep so I called the nurse and now just took my Xanax again. I don’t want to depend on pills. I know my insomnia is triggered by my anxiety of still being in the hospital. I wish I could discharge so this can end. I’ve tried all meditation and sleep hypnosis video. Doesn’t work and gets me more anxious.
Signal	The brain is complicated, I have always suffered from anxiety, but until the last couple of weeks I have only began to admit to myself that that's what it is.My anxiety became best of friends back in 2017, while I graduating from University. One bad night's sleep turned into one bad month, I thought I would never get back to normal, however, I would stay positive and I would fight it. I would often lie with my eyes closed not thinking, for hours but I still just wouldn't fall asleep.Eventually I got better but since then, every night, I will always worry about if I won't sleep. I was never sure what I did that fixed it, but I've never fully conquered it.I got so nervous about waking early I moved my work shifts to the afternoon so that I never had to worry about an early start;Fast forward to today, I have even moved to the other side of the world, so I can work afternoons but get a better pay. The insomnia is back, on Monday coming down with a cold it kept me awake until 5am, the worst part was I entered a light sleep, an hour at a time, waking up, and was wide awake at 9am. To make things worse, I have simply not been to fall asleep for the past 3 days and I'm sick. I have also been down recently as I am recovering from a break up, it's been so long I forgot what it's like to be in the dark, and I feel like my body will never be the same again. If I sleep, I can stay happy, but when this is gone, I am hopeless.This time, I'm falling asleep, only waking within 10 minutes wondering if I had drifted or not, but for the life of me I cannot pass into sleep, and I feel like my mind is quiet. Am I broken? Once an insomniac, can you ever truly get better?
NotSignal	So I work really hard to have healthy sleep hygiene, but no matter what I do, the thing that really keeps me awake is my own thoughts.Any tips/tricks on quieting the noise?
NotSignal	If I take a hypnotic drug for sleep, I have about a 50:50 chance that I will fall asleep. The other outcome is the complete opposite. I feel happy, I’m awake, I can talk, think, type, etc. I can feel the drug’s common effects, the “lower inhibition” effect - so not only am I happy, and awake, I’m also quite corruptible. Kidding aside since I can feel that lowering of inhabition is there, it just makes me diligent on re-evaluating my decisions. While it might not be the best time to begin to file your income taxes, it could be a great time to read thru RedditQuestion: (1)Does this happen to anyone else? If yes, let me know and details. (2) Can anyone tell me why this medicine can produce bi-polar outcomes and please feel free to go all geeky on the pharma/biology/chemistry of the matter. Thanks! Nicole
Signal	Whenever I can’t fall asleep, I start to think about my life and everything that’s happened. I take melatonin to help me fall asleep, but sometimes I feel like it doesn’t work!! I still wake up randomly in the middle of the night and toss and turn. I once tried taking two melatonin pills and even that didn’t help me.This is so annoying!!!!!!
NotSignal	I saw a post on here that said when you go to bed try to tell yourself that you’re just resting, not trying to sleep. So I tried it last night. I went to bed and told myself that I wasn’t expecting any sleep at all, I was just lying down to rest. And it actually worked. Every time I got up in the middle of the night, I told myself the same thing and I fell back asleep easily. After sleeping only 2-3 hours for weeks, last night is the first night I actually got adequate sleep. I feel on top of the world right now. Hopefully it continues to work, I’m still anxious that last night was a fluke and I’m going to struggle with sleep tonight as I always do. But for the first time in months, the thought of going to bed doesn’t completely give me dread and I’m so grateful for that.
NotSignal	Anyone else awake? I've played video games went for a drive and taken a shower looks like my day has started 😅
NotSignal	I use earplugs and cover my upper ear with a pillow or hand. Any noise, knock wakes me up.Recently, I moved to a new apartment, where neighbors are constantly noisy. Earplugs don't help.I tried white noise, brown noise, rain, fan, and many other sounds. I can’t fall asleep with any noise.Does anyone have such a problem?
Signal	So, I was taking trazodone for 3.5 months and it stopped working. If I take another med for another 3 months and come back to trazodone, will it work again? Will it work the same as the first time I used it? I was doing cbt-i but it's gonna take a few months to see results and I'm sleeping 2-3 hours everyday because nobody wants to give mirtazapine or ambien 🙄 If I go to the ER do you think they will give me those? I just can wait 3-4 weeks for an appointment with a psychiatrist to prescribe me those
Signal	Every since I (F20) developed insomnia ( taking hours to fall asleep) + anxiety about sleep I’ve put on a significant amount of weight without changing my diet and/if not improving it.I’m wondering whether it’s related to insomnia and how do you deal with it.
NotSignal	Ever since it became more warm since march allready i had rly terrible insomnia, sometimes i manage to fall asleep but now with the humid and hot nights its so incredibly hard to fall asleep, anyone any good tips how to cool down the body a little? I ve been rly inactive physically the past 4 months due to lockdown, but now its getting less, any advice is rly welcome..
NotSignal	I fell asleep at 12 PM but it's a good starter. Woke up for a few minutes at 4 AM but got back to sleep. Woke up fully rested today at 9:30 AM. So happy because usually I wake up at 1 PM.
Signal	I have prescribed medication for sleep. They are Clonazepam or lorazepam. Clonazepam 1-2mg or lorazepam 1/2mg. They are sedating medication that help you sleep if you have insomnia. I’m planning on taking it tonight at 7:30 or 8pm. If you have insomnia and can’t sleep then talk to your doctor about it and see if he/she recommends medication for sleep. Hope this helps! Peace ✌🏻
Signal	I have long term insomnia because of chronic illnesses (POTS, EDS, MCAD, etc) and pain but lately it’s been extra bad. I can’t seem to get into a deep sleep, I’m in that place where I’m drowsy and kind of sleeping, but aware and conscious that I’m half awake at the same time. Anyway, basically the whole night I just have this pit of fear in my stomach. I’m not sure what I’m scared of or why it’s happening. I’m waking up almost every hour because of it. And practically every time I’m waking up in the morning, I start having a panic attack as I’m coming out of my (semi-not really) sleep. I have terrible anxiety but never has it infiltrated my sleep like this before. Has anyone experienced this, have any ideas as to why this is happening, or have any advice at all? I just can’t figure out how manage/fix it, and it isn’t stopping. TIA
Signal	It’s like the 5th consecutive night I wake up diring the night (1-3 am) and cant go back to sleep. I dont know what’s happening, but I dont like this. The thin is because i wake up so early the next day I feel so tired at night that I have to go to sleep very early, but then I wake up after only 2-4 hours of sleep, I’ve never had sleepproblems, sometimes the occasional ‘cant fall asleep today’ but this is completly new and I hate it. Any advices?
Signal	I’m posting here because I’ve seen a few mentions of the prescribed sleep aid - Trazadone I started a few weeks ago and I think I’m finally reaping the full benefits, my only side effect is insane cotton mouth. My husband saw the doctor too and asked for Trazadone since he saw it working for me. Within 4 days of taking it he decided to stop because he “felt crazy.” He described a side effect that I had too but I was able to ignore until it went away (I have had a lot of recreational experiences.) It’s not so much a hallucination but thinking for a second that something is something else. Like you know how you’ll notice if your kid or dog is in the room from your peripheral vision? Well this would be like we could swear our daughter was in a room but then turned around to see a vacuum. For a while I kept mistaking a particular shoe was my dog.I’ve never heard of this symptom before. Has anyone experienced it or know the name? Thank you!
Signal	I have work at 3pm today (it is 5am right now) and I’m trying so hard to go to sleep but I can’t. Now I am anxious about not getting enough sleep, because I feel like when I don’t get enough sleep I feel anxious during my shift at work. Why does sleep matter so much? It shouldn’t affect my anxiety so much. I’m so frustrated ahh!
NotSignal	This happened a lot more before this whole corona thing because I had a set time to wake up. But I will try to sleep but end up just lying there with my eyes closed for hours. It happens randomly and it really is bothering me. I have tried the breathing techniques and the nightly actions that trick the body into falling asleep. Do I have a form if insomnia and is there any advice for my predicament?
NotSignal	I apologize in advance for the length of my post, it's just that I don't know how I could illustrate that in fewer words, also please excuse me if I make some grammar mistakes because I'm not native in English.I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember (literally), a really bad one that made me almost attempt to take my own life several times before.------------------------------I don't think I lived a life where I was able to have a healthy sleep on regular basis, I sometimes spend around 8 hours trying to fall asleep before I can get only 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep (and this is not rare in my case).I think my problem is a bit different, it's not simply being unable to fall asleep, I actually hate sleep, I dread the idea of it so much that sometimes when I ALMOST fall asleep after hours of trying, I wake myself (and end up beating myself up for it for the rest of the night, you can imagine the mental torture this puts me through).I can't find a label for this, I read about Somniphobia (or fear of sleep) but I'm not entirely sure that I have it, because I'm not, for example, afraid of dying in my sleep (to be honest, I sometimes wish so), or afraid of nightmares (I don't have them too frequently), I'm not "afraid" of sleep, I "hate" it, it makes me extremely anxious, maybe the only thing I fear about it is the time I'm going to spend trying to fall asleep and not being able to.So basically this is how I feel: everyday when I wake up, the anxiety starts to build up gradually till it reaches its peak at my - supposedly - bedtime, so the thought of having to sleep every night freaks me out so much that it, by itself, distracts me from my daily activities.I'm 25 years old, and I have been sleep deprived for most of my life, and not to mention that the negative health consequences I got from this are countless, both mentally and physically, they're too many to include here now.I tried everything, therapy, psychiatry (still do), reading & self-help, it's also too difficult to adopt a healthy lifestyle where I exercise and eat healthy when I'm exhausted all the time and can never, absolutely ever, have a consistent daily routine, because my day is always messed up and unpredictable.I visited different psychiatrists who got me hooked up on meds for the past 3-4 years, and they don't do a thing, sleeping meds work by knocking me out when the dose is high enough, only to leave me drained the next day, unable to get out of bed or do anything.I missed out on too many opportunities because of this, I work as a software developer, and while I'm considered good at what I do (because I like it), I can't help but imagine how I would actually perform if I wasn't exhausted and tired all the time, and wherever I work, the biggest complaint I get about me is that I show up late, and deliver slower than expected, all while I kill myself trying to deliver as fast as possible because of my unpredictable routine and lack of focus. So going to work without sleep, traveling without sleep, going to the gym without sleep, this has become the norm for me.I recently gave up on everything, I stopped going to my doctor, exercising and going to the gym because it was too exhausting to maintain anymore, and I now eat irresponsibly whenever I feel hungry, which is why I'm starting to gain a lot of weight. I basically entered a very bad phase now that I can forsee how it will end.So I truly wanna know, am I really beyond help? Is there anything I can do? What is this?
Signal	it just seems like a distant dream. no matter how tired i am, no matter how long i lay there, my body refuses to pass out. why? it feels like i’ll never fall asleep again. i don’t know why i’m this way. i’m so jittery and ridden with anxiety. i just want to sleep again. i can’t even think straight and i’m so angry for no good reason.
NotSignal	I noticed in the past few years, February and the beginning of summer are the worst. These past few weeks have been full of surprises. From staying up till 8 on the morning to waking up after 6 hours and not being able to fall asleep to 3 hours. WeeeeeeFiller to get past dumb 100 character rule. Who the hell counts characters when they type? Is that like counting sheep but for OCD Reddie bots?
NotSignal	What do y’all do when you can’t sleep or what activities do you do which helps you sleep?Other than using flower, I do...• Eating :p• Watching Rick and Morty• Read Lord of the Rings• the shaky weighty ;)
Signal	Hey guys, it seems that every night I sleep I would be woken up after 3-4 hours of sleep. Every time I get woken up, my mind would be really bothered and my anxiety will attack at the same time. It has been a recurring thing for about a month now. The main cause of these events are from being heartbroken to be exact. Because that person would always be in my dreams and in my waking moments, she would be in my head. I want get over it as it's not really helping me get better for myself.I would always try to get over my feelings for her before sleeping so that I can get a goodnight sleep. It would help as I get sleepy and doze off. But then in the middle of the night I would be woken up every night.Have you guys experienced something like this before? What did you do to get a proper 8 hrs sleep?
NotSignal	Hello, last night i couldnt fall asleep again, and i came across an article talking about overtiredness. Perhaps Corona makes us all stay at home all day long and most of us are on their phones 24/7, could this cause the problem? I've only slept when i was completely worn out and tired since 3 weeks now, i just can't stop thinking at night & sleeping meds are not an option for me because i don't want to get addicted to themanyone else having the same trouble?
Signal	I've had just under half a bottle of red wine mixed with lemonade, I dont feel drunk, I want to take a 25mg tablet, I'm aware of increased drowsiness which is fine but im presuming there wont be anymore serious complications as both are a small amount of each substance? Any advice would be appreciated!
Signal	I haven’t slept good the last few nights (2-4 hours of sleep a night). I have no history of insomnia or anxiety whatsoever. I normally sleep about 10 hrs a night. It’s also my summer break so I have nothing in particular to stress me out. A few nights ago I stayed up later than I should have (around 1 am) playing a game. I normally have no problem after doing something like this. However, I had something to do the next day, so I knew I needed to sleep quickly. But just the thought of knowing I needed to fall asleep is what kept me up. The more I thought about how much I needed to fall asleep, the more it kept me up. Now every night since, I go into bed knowing that I need to fall asleep to catch up on my sleep schedule, and I fall into the same pattern. This is so frustrating just lying in my bed knowing I need to fall asleep but I cannot. Does somebody have tips to turn my brain off and just sleep? I have tried meditation, calm story apps, and melatonin. None have been effective.
Signal	I have always had sleeping problems but I'm not sure if its insomnia. I do sleep usually every night but it takes hours at a time usually to get asleep and during the night I barely "sleep". I wake up about 10 times a night and usually I can go back fastish if I just act like I didnt wake up but about 3 times I fully wake up. And nights I do sleep mostly uninterrupted I dont get deep sleep and wake up tired and during the day I'm very tired with a couple bursts of energy ever now and then. I exercise a lot, I dont drink caffeine anymore, I take melatonin which ik isnt the best but uts something for rn, and I am always tired but rarely get sleep. Is this insomnia? Do you guys ever sleep? Ik that's a dumb question but do you need medication or do you still get sleep at night just not good or it takes a long time? And do you ever have nights where without any assist you can just sleep good with no problems? I decided to make this post after laying in my bed for 8 hours straight with my eyes closed and nothing happened and I'm getting very annoyed at sleeping to the point where I dont want to even try because ik I wont be able to.
Signal	Im off to the doctor and wanna ask for a prescription i didn't try yet. Benzos(and Zopi) give me rebound anxietyTrazodone / quetiapine give me a hangover and stop working eventually Mirtazapine stops working after a whileHydroxizine hangoverAgomelatine/melatonin/magnesium do nothing Baclofen stimulates meKratom/opiates not sustainableClonidine ineffective Antihistamines stop workingKava ineffective Gabapentin bad sleep Any suggestion? I know my only chance ia working on the underlying cause, but until i figure it out I need to sleep.
Signal	Anyone have experience with this? I can fall asleep within 20-30 min generally, but wake up half a dozen times a night. I'm usually not up for long stretches at those times, but long enough that I'm very aware of it and have to work at falling back asleep every time. I'm exhausted every morning because of this. 8 hours in bed feels like 4.I don't have sleep apnea. I'm not waking up to pee. I barely drink caffeine. My brain just seems trained to wake up every 1-2 hours, and I don't know how to fix it. I'm pretty sure this is an underlying cause of my worsening heart palpitations. TIA for any help 🙏
NotSignal	Even my attempts to correct it by staying up all day don't work. I'll sleep that night, but the next night I'll be sleepless. What kind of bullshit is this?
Signal	I work an overnight shift. Occasionally (2-3 times a year) my body will get out of sync. I won’t be able to go to sleep until 6am-7am (I get off at 4am) and will wake up at 9am. So there’s an issue with getting to sleep and staying asleep. My doctor prescribed me Restoril first which wasn’t very effective and then Ambien which worked slightly better but eventually my body just ran it’s course and got back on schedule. Well, now it’s out of sync again and it’s really effecting my work while I’m awake this time around. And I cannot wait the 2-3 weeks for it work itself out. Could I take the leftover Ambien and Restoril together? I know from a chemical/psychophysical perspective they work differently. Just hoping I might be able to get and stay asleep better with both. But also don’t want to accidentally kill myself...
NotSignal	I've had this cool theory for a while which I personally hold true but I'm sure most of you will say is far fetched.I personally believe that nature is far more adaptable, dynamicly resilient and powerful than we as a society believe. I can't seem to find any articles on the topic because everyone is jaded by the belief that humanity's destruction and eradication of life on earth will bring a collapse to the natural world. This is what I believe is wrong, as we intently destroy the global ecosystem on an unprecedented scale, the overall gene pool of life as a mass will begin to be forced to select for traits that are effective in reducing humanity's stresses and impacts for it's own survival. Many species are evolving to, or are being manipulated into cooperating with humans. But I believe many more species are evolving to directly or indirectly weaken and destroy mankind.Simply put, life on Earth has constantly evolved and adapted to thrive even through absolute destruction and percievably impossible scenarios. The fact that life came to exist from the most coincidental and bizarre circumstances and has not gone away proves the incredible resilience it holds. We as humans are now constantly destroying and eradicating, forcing nature into extremes to ensure its own survival.Remember that by nature I mean all cellular and non-cellular life on earth except humanity. Plants, animals, fungi, pathogens, bacteria and everything in between. Particularly I emphasise on microscopic life such as viruses, bacterial and pathogens as these are the fastest to evolve and are thus the most adaptive and resilient of all. Humanity's extortion and destruction is often forcing species to have as profound an impact on humanities prosperity and inevitable survival as possible. The rapidly exponential rate at which life is beginning to cohesively 'jepoardise' humanities prosperity will also be forced to essentially co-operate against mankind and form dynamic direct or indirect systems which make human life more difficult.Life will constantly try to restore the natural equilibrium that existed before the Anthropocene (human epoch), destroy humankind's existence entirely or force humankind into creating this natural equilibrium which would likely result in various systems of human population control. I know what many of you are thinking, your probably that humankind possesses the ability to and is essentially acting to destroy the Earth and all life on it. But I simply do not believe we are yet capable of, or never will be capable of destroying life on earth entirely. Not to say if we really tried to say blow the world up by using all nuclear power on earth to creat an exlosion that somehow could break the world in two, of manipulated the trajectory of a meteorite or space Phenomena of some kind to literally disintegrate or split the earth into pieces (with the potential survival of life within the vacuum of space forced to cling in). I simply do not believe we are yet capable or even ever will be capable of the Earth's destruction, mother Earth will likely bring us down first.If every nuclear warhead on earth were to simultaneously be detonated, extremely catastrophic mass extinction would likely entale and the majority of life will perish. However just as life came to be here life will always remain on earth, and there will always be outliers, enclave, mutated and biologically resistant life that will then flourish and prosper in a new environment with very little competition. In fact the 'eternal' nuclear fallout would dramatically increase the rate of mutation in genetics and life would raidly evolve into a terrifyingly dynamic new reality, or some fungi will just evolve to rapidly detox and irradiate the earth returning it to normal 😂Now to get back to the point I'm making, humanity must either universally co-operate with the natural world. Or be forced into a position where they are no longer the dominant species. Another species will also likely evolve to be sentient and compete with humanity in a geographically short time period, with many more to follow. This may all seem like jibber jabber to some of you, it seems that our society's ego has us believe that we are better than nature. We often believe we are not animals and we are so advanced that we have the ability to prosper through anything nature throws at us. But this is simply untrue and mother nature will grab humanity by the balls when she wants to, and her grip is getting tighter.I don't have any degrees, in fact I don't even have any sources to quote here. There is no reason for you to agree with me, any and all argumant or rebuttal will be great and I would love for someone to raise a point that makes my theory obsolete. I could go on about this with many more intricate predictive theories on the topic, but I have so many more ideas and theories I just need to get out of my head.Nah, I got a couple other thoughts on this as well. Nature's manipulation of hamnkind may even be completely indirect, we may never now how the natural world can impact our psyche and may simply create an extreme tendency for society to be extremely unstable. The DNA that codes our life may likely select for genes that encourage humans to fight each other as a form of population control, and this may be how an equilibrium could be established. Overpopulation will likely lead to conflict, famine, diseases and all as nature will and always has been thriving for a world of diversity and cohabitation. The environmental recovery caused by the global impact of covid-19 is a great example of how nature indirectly works together against us. Since animals that transmit diseases will often prosper through the lessened impact of humanity in their own lives. Species that can transmit viruses directly or indirectly to humans, will likely thrive, thus selecting for genes which directly or indirectly cause human habitation within their environment to decrease or desist. This will likely lead to a world where animals evolve purely to kill humans, the outcome in only a couple millenia will be scary af.The problem I see is not animals or plants though, it's pathogens and all the microscopic stuff. When the environment benefits from a virus that impairs humanitys impact, many others will naturally begin to evolve to the benefit of other species in this ecosystem, and diseases will do this first. Viruses and bacteria are of particular concern here since they or the most rapid to evolve and adapt to a change in their environment. Zoonotic viruses that rapidly immobilise humans will have significant benefits to their hosts and ecosystems they are within thus zoonotic viruses that can infect humans will likely be the first step in Earth establishing an equilibrium. If overpopulation is somehow rapidly addressed this would probably significantly reduce the rate at which this 'theoretical bullshit' may happen. Realised I forgot to mention why I don't have faith in our sciences or doctors to fight spontaneous natural occuring diseases. Viruses/bacteria/pathogens all that, have n essentially infinite ability to evolve, gain resistances and become immune or more severe. It is commonly known that most viruses do not want to kill their hosts, but when the entire global ecosystem benefits from a virus killing it's host, those viruses will begin to occur far more frequently and likely with increasing severity. Sorry if this is scary for you somehow as long as you are young and healthy you will probably be fine but I can't say much about the outcome of a likely upcoming war of significant proportion, likely fought very unconventionally.TLDR and a lil conclusion:Nature is powerful as heck, in the end we are just another species on this planet and through all the great things we have and will achieve, mother Earth will be able to keep us in check.I don't understand why I am unable to find articles on this, mass extinction does not simply cause life as a whole to perish, it strengthens the gene pool, and by impacting essentially all species of life on Earth; we are essentially creating our own undoing. Overpopulation will likely trigger the most significant mechanisms of 'human eridication'. You can say I'm just a doomsday theorist or something but this will not happen in a couple of years, I believe it has been ongoing ince we first discovered fire and is now taking a drastic step in its inevitable fate. Also not sure if I even mentioned global warming, but the extreme loss and extinction caused by this will likely be short lived, most ecosystems will eventually benefit from Increased temperatures with a global increase in rainfall and water available for evaporation. Fungi and other live organisms will likely evolve systems to reduce harmful gases and elements in the ground and air (as they already do) and filter out the 'toxins'.I also just want to say that every opinion is biased somehow, of course this for example, but even the most credible articles and studies from prestigious universities or organisations. Simply by thinking that we as humans are top shit, the short term impact of our actions/activities blind us in our judgement of the long term outcome. Nature finds a way, always will and always has, we don't know why or how this occured, but it has clearly proven to be terrifyingly powerful and resilient. Humanity must lose its ego, we might look like top shit right now but some day or another we will be put in our place. Mother nature is patiently waiting to bitch slap us back into our caves, and it kinda seems that no-one wants to talk about this?Also yes, this is something I thought about on a mushroom trip, but I've formulated the other ideas since. WAKE UP SHEEPLEZ nah jk kidding there's nothing we can do lmao😅
NotSignal	I haven’t sleep in almost two days bcz I don’t feel like it. I felt guilty for sleeping. I feel like I’m taking away others’ rest and let them suffer while I enjoy my sleep. That thoughts have been bugging me for a while now and I can’t sleep peacefully, not more than 3 hours. Ik my situation is not as bad as you guys around here. I’m sorry you all are in pain. You guys deserve your sleep and rest and I shouldn’t take that away. Maybe it’s a immature thought, I’m stupid that’s all.Btw I thought reading manga would help me to stop crying, so I read Killing Stalking... I ended up finishing it and it didn’t help but made me cry more lol. But it’s a good story tho imo. Have a great day .!
Signal	I wish nobody ever made that wikipedia page about the disease. People with high anxiety look that shit up and immediatelt self-diagnose themselves. Funny thing is most of the symptoms match with the symptoms of sleep deprivation, so no shit it will be easy to just absorb the idea into your mind. Two things:1. Only 32 cases have been recorded since 1988. So 1 person per year catches this disease. Your chances of getting it this year is 1 in a 7 billlion. Overall, less than 1 in 100 million or something, even more ridiculous to do the math.2. It is a neurological disease, so just sleeplessness is not enough to diagnose it with the disease.Please, stop worrying, you don't have it. Sleeplessness leads to anxiety, in a high anxiety state people look the disease up and they get more anxious, therefore getting less sleep. I was also caught in this loop and did not sleep for months. Anxiety is a bitch so your brain will trick you, but you don't have it 100 %.Cheers
NotSignal	(20M) and in the armyFor all I’ve known I’ve been a heavy sleeper, but in the recent years it’s been getting worse. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep and stay up for two days and the sleep and stay up for two days and then sleep. In a normal week if I sleep less than 5 hours I don’t wake up from my alarms ringing. I’ve bought a electric wristband that can shock me when I need to wake up, but I can sleep through that on its highest setting. I have a constant fear that I won’t be able to get up and go to work in the morning and it can make me sleepless some night. Anyone who has any trick that can make me wake up easier?
NotSignal	This is happening for almost 7 years.When i finally fall asleep i wake up totally broke and that is every day rutine.Somebody please give me some advices ? Or some tips for pills ? Thank a lot( Sorry for bad English)
NotSignal	I can’t even be at my puppy’s side right now as he waits his turn at the emergency vet. I can’t sleep. Swells of anxiety and heart break. My girlfriend’s a nurse at work right now, so I’m alone, and I keep replaying the scene in my head.How the hell do I sleep?
Signal	Once I'm asleep I have no problem staying asleep (which actually often causes me to miss classes, etc), but when I'm trying to \*get to sleep\* I find I often can't because:1. I feel anxious about today and whether I've been working hard enough.2. I feel anxious about the coming day.3. My sleep schedule is already so off-kilter that the seldom times I'm not anxious, my brain doesn't feel like it's actually time for bed.I've tried melatonin (doesn't seem to do anything for me), limiting screen time, reading, and a whole bunch of other stuff, but it never seems to help. The one reprieve I've had recently is by smoking weed right before bed, but it clearly makes my girlfriend concerned for my health and I don't blame her -- if there was another solution, I'd be happy to use it.Two questions:1. Has anybody had success with therapy for insomnia? Was it succesful?2. Alternatively, can anybody recommend any books that could help?For clarity: in my day-to-day I'm relatively anxiety free now. It used to be a problem, but I've gained a lot of coping skills that help me overcome anxiety like that when it comes up. Now it's just anxiety over getting to sleep.Thanks so much in advance for any help or suggestions, it really means a lot :).
NotSignal	me: hey brain lets go to sleep mkaybrain: but what if you die? what if I don't let you sleep? what will happen tomorrow? wha-trazodone: beep boop lalala your coordination is gone benzo: uuuuhhhhhhssri: hey lemme give you some more I n s o m n i a but at least you don't have anxiety haha😂fuck you
Signal	I'm a 20 year old male that ,recently, can't seem to sleep , I slept 1 hour combining last two nights with a ''power nap'' in the middle to be able to cope with the exhaustion during the day, the intriguing part is that I feel relaxed,drowsy,sleepy,etc but apparently I can't sleep, I'm reading Say Goodnight to Insomnia by Gregg D Jacobs, I applied some of the techniques to little result, I also started exercising and cutting out caffeine from my usual routine. Any suggestions?, and could it be some sort of anxiety or stress that I have been holding back all this time? I'm thanking anyone who had the patience to read and also, sorry for any errors regarding my english, it's my second language.
NotSignal	Question to the insomniacs who survive off 4-5 hours sleep a night.. I’ve had insomnia for 3 months now and I get like 4 hours a night - for those who are the same do yous feel exhausted and really tired during the day?
NotSignal	Does anyone here ever feel like their brain was awake while their body feel asleep or something?&#x200B;I go to bed at 11, "fall asleep" at midnight, and "wake up" at 1. It's like I half shut down or something, I stop hearing my white noise machine and don't feel like I was conscious, but I certainly don't think I was fully asleep. Sometimes I will have dreams in this state. It is so hard to explain. Best way I can sum it up as it feels like I was stuck in a state of ALMOST being asleep for a while..
NotSignal	All I do is Google insomnia fixes or causes when I can't sleep, but I never see ads for insomnia things on social media afterwards. This puzzles me because I googled trash services ONE TIME, and for the past week, trash pickup service ads have been all I've seen. Same with other things I've googled, even some medical symptoms, but never insomnia.When I Google Insomnia, I also only get the same advice (keep room cool and dark, develop a routine, etc.). One time I did get an article about how typical sleep hygiene tips don't tend to work for chronic insomniacs (duh). I think this is the same education doctors get, along with lists of possible Rx's to give us. So useless. I guess companies have learned that you can't sell quick fixes to us, because we've all learned that nothing works.
Signal	I had an car accident 10 months ago which caused a "malfunction" of my hypothalamus with several symptoms and blood values being waaay out of normal. Main symptom is a complete loss of sleep for about 6 months, and now I sleep like 2-3 hrs a week (!, not daily) with still no REM sleep at all. I suffer from a weak bladder (it's not tooooo bad), muscle stiffness (only left leg), concentration problems and complete loss of feeling fear, tired, excited and so on. No one in Germany can help me anymore. I don't suffer from FFI (already had an PET CT, 7Tesla MRT) or other brain illnesses, it was a direct consequence of the accident. Had several polysomnographys - all showed that I'm right about not sleeping at all. I'm "sick" of whining and I'm trying to go to work next month as an IT consultant. Could be a minor superpower (could work 24/7, no problem) and it's pretty likely that I will not life as long as I would with sleep. But I'll just move on and work for the time I can. Strangely enough I don't have any problems with my memory at all and blood values are normal again (expect melatonin, which makes sense).Wish my luck. If any neurologist in Germany is interested in my case, feel free to reach out.
NotSignal	Currently writing this at 2:15am which for some insomniacs I imagine doesn’t sound bad, however, I would like to preface saying that I am not an insomniac just having sleeping troubles.I wasn’t sure where to go to ask for help with this but just assumed this was the next best thing. My problem is that I have an incredibly difficult time getting to sleep after waking up late. I’ve always assumed that this is natural as basic logic would lead you to believe - you wake up late you go to bed late... but it’s getting a bit ridiculous now. On every day of the week except Tuesday I wake up at 6:45am for school. On Tuesdays I start school at 1pm meaning I can sleep in until a reasonable time of 9:30am. However I’ve noticed a pattern that EVERY Tuesday (or Wednesday morning) I get to sleep at 1-2am as a result of sleeping in. This is particularly bad for me since I have to wake up at 6:45. This however, does not only extend to Tuesday’s. Of course on weekends I’m also able to sleep in and subsequently go to bed often at about 1am on a Monday morning. Is this really just natural? I’m sick of getting into bed at 11-11:30 only to do absolutely NOTHING for hours. I already have existing “troubles” with sleep, but wouldn’t describe them as necessarily bad just troubles. If I wake up at 6:45am and get into bed at 11-11:30 that night, I will always get to sleep at 12-12:30. The hour and a half wait really is getting to me now... Is this really anything or am I being a sook?
NotSignal	I've been awake 5.5 days so far. I tried everything in the book. Now being awake is changing me. Ive become so much more negative and I dont like that
NotSignal	I just felt like complaining about a doctor's appointment, and I figured this is the only place where people would be sympathetic. &#x200B;*doc:* What are you here for today?*me:* I have insomnia.*doc:* So.*me*: So I only slept an hour last night, and I'm really tired, and I can't fall asleep.*doc*: Just force yourself to stay awake the rest of the day. Then when you go to bed tonight you'll be really tired, and you won't have insomnia anymore. *me:* I don't have to force myself to stay awake. I literally can't fall asleep. And when I go to bed tonight I still might not be able to fall asleep until tomorrow. There's a couple times a week when I won't be able to fall asleep for over 24 hours. And sometimes it's more than 30.*doc:* You must drink a lot of caffeine to make yourself stay awake for over 30 hours.*me:* I don't drink caffeine.*doc:* You can stay awake over 30 hours without caffeine?*me:* Yes.*doc:* Then it must be depression.*me:* It's not depression.*doc:* There are only two reasons why people can't fall asleep: either they're drinking too much caffeine or they're depressed. You said you don't drink caffeine, so it has to be depression.*me:* If I'm depressed about anything it's *because* I can't sleep.*doc:* I've never heard of anyone being depressed just because they can't fall asleep.*me:* I have no life because of insomnia. I never know when I'm going to be able to sleep or for how long, so I can't make any plans in advance. But even when I do sleep it's rarely for more than a few hours, so I'm too tired to go anywhere or do anything. *doc:* There's people out there with real diseases like cancer or heart disease. And you're honestly in here telling me you're depressed just because you can't fall asleep. *me:* You're the one who keeps talking about depression. I'm just really tired, and I want to sleep.*doc:* I can prescribe you some antidepressants, but there's nothing else I can do.
Signal	Of course people have have insomnia :D but, am wondering if anyone else have a very tough time waking up and can sleep for extended periods of time?Like, you have insomnia and can't fall asleep until very late.But then when you actually fall asleep you can sleep for 12 hours straight?Plus, you never feel like you slept good.It's such an annoying combo, since you lay there for hours trying to fall asleep, but then when you fall asleep it's so tough to get up out of bed to go to work.Or even on days where you don't have to do anything, you sleep for a very long time.It's such a weird combo.Impossible to fall asleep, but then when you do you sleep for a long time and it's so difficult to actually get out of bed because all you want to do is sleep.And you never feel refreshed when you wake up, regardless of how long you slept.Think it's called **Idiopathic Hypersomnia.**Does anyone struggle with something like this?
Signal	i think i’ve gotten about 3 hours of sleep total in the past two days. i’m not even sure if i did sleep last night but if i did it was only an hour or two, then wake up at like 7 and couldn’t sleep again. i’m so scared i won’t be able to sleep tonight again. i have no energy i’m just crying all day :(
Signal	I have trouble falling asleep for the past 2 months. I couldn't sleep at night, early. It would take upto 3 am for me to fall asleep. Moreover, i don't feel sleepy at afternoon also. So i consulted a doctor online, via an app. He recognized that i have insomnia (sleep disturbance). So he prescribed me Chlorpromazine 50 mg tablets and asked me to follow up after a week and he closed the consultation. The doctor took long gaps to reply for my messages, before prescribing medicines. So i consulted another doctor meanwhile, and i told my problem. He prescribed me meloset 3mg for 1 week and asked me to follow up. Now I ordered both medicines via the app. Now i am confused, which medicine should i take at night. Or maybe bothAnd btw, can anyone suggest me a good and safe medicine for my sleeping disorder?
NotSignal	My husband has no problems falling asleep, but he CONSTANTLY wakes up. Usually either just to turn, or sometimes to sit up in bed for a minute. I have problems falling asleep so I witness everything. He probably does something every 15 minutes or so, and tonight sat up three times in under an hour. Always falls asleep instantly again right after.He does snore but did a sleep test a couple months back and they said he only had mild sleep apnea.Could it just be insomnia?
Signal	Hey. I don't even know if it's the right forum to write that. I didn't sleep last night cause of pure idiocy and had shit to do during the day. Tonight (4am) now , I've been too freaked out to go to bed because of the time I've been awake. This is the only thing stopping me from resting. Worrying about what's gonna happen to me if I don't make it. Also my mind feels lighter and mushed and I'm anxious. And I can't focus well on my movements. All this experience sucks and I really need a way to calm down. Is it too dangerous staying awake for so long? Or even 48 hours? And why does it feel like I'm fainting when I close my eyes and try to sleep?
Signal	I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep for weeks on end due to some extreme anxiety. I know a lot of us here can relate since insomnia is often perpetuated by anxiety. It progressed to a point where I was getting hypnic jerks 100 times a night instead of my brain shutting off and drifting off to sleep like a normal person. I was <THIS> close to admitting myself to a mental hospital. Luckily I found myself a really great psychiatrist after hours of searching online and got some diagnoses of OCD, GAD, and bipolar, so that explains a lot. I guess my point is, don't let insomnia consume your life and feel like you have to suffer through it without help. I was honestly under the impression that I was going to die from lack of sleep. My brain chemicals are a little off, and that's okay. I got some medications and I have slept for 7 hours in the last two nights. I had the realization this morning that that is more sleep than I would get most full WEEKS. I feel like a completely different person. My movements feel smooth and not forced. I don't feel like every movement is painfully forced. I was prescribed gabapentin which worked surprisingly well. Now, I know this isn't a long term solution, and most medication isn't, but for now there's nothing better than the reassurance that I CAN sleep, and I'm not going to die, and neither are you. There's a light at the end of this. :)
Signal	**Summary**: I feel the need to talk about my experience with **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**. I have had insomnia for about 8 months (it's been hell) but now have been sleeping well with no aid for about 6 weeks after CBT therapy. Prior to trying it, I told myself I would make a post if it worked.**Disclaimer**: * Use this information to decide if you want to try CBT. There are books on how to do self-CBT but there's **A TON** of things that a Therapist or Psychiatrist will do better. Don't assume that I'm covering all the details. * Everyone is different. Insomnia affects everyone differently and can be solved differently.* Your primary doctor/physician should be your first point of information regarding sleep and medication. * I’m writing this because I found that there is little information about CBT. * I’m not here for critique or to judge others. Insomnia just really really sucks and I thought it was ruining my life. (Or that's how I felt)######Quick description of my situation:* **My Insomnia**: Main issue for me is falling asleep rather than keeping asleep (there is really two different types). For 8 months, I either got zero sleep, or 3 hours at 7am when the sun was coming up. My brain just can’t turn off sometimes. I over think things a lot and it won’t turn off. * **Psychological Causes**: Depression and anxiety due to dissatisfaction at work, pathologizing sleep... I think* **Physical Causes**: Disrupted sleep due to loud neighbors, every other day I was changing houses by sleeping at my girlfriends, and due increased chemical dependence on drugs######My experience:So lately I have been seeing a CBT Sleep Specialist Psychiatrist. After my second or third appointment looking for more/different medication from my family doctor, he off-handily mentioned CBT as a highly successful alternative but didn’t push it very hard. Not sure if it was due to stigma with mental health or personal medical philosophy but we quickly moved on to the conversation of prescriptions and general sleep hygiene. Only on my 6th appointment, did I ask for a referral because I was starting ramp on my zoplicone dosage and felt that I needed to get serious about trying every option. I know medication works for a lot of people but I didn’t want to become dependent so early in life. After working as a pharmacy technician in the past, I saw people were dependant and it was scary when were out of stock and a customer was in desperate need of it for the very same night. So I asked for a referral and waited for my first appointment.So enough background... there are some valuable things I worked on with my Psychiatrist. 1. Biggest and first thing was **breathing exercises**. And reducing heart rate. Like longer times breathing out. Shorting times breathing in. Practicing what ratio of time works best for me by using actual heart rate sensors. At home, I do it while watching a show with my girlfriend before bed. If I start yawning, I take that as my queue to ~try to sleep~. This is also useful for daily life when you're just stressed. 2. **Learning misconceptions** about basic sleep hygiene. A lot of the facts online apply to everyone differently. You got to learn what works for you.3. **Being comfortable with less**. Like a consistent 5*6 hours nights rather than on*and*off 8*9 hours every day. Also not fighting a bad night. Letting myself live within it. Doing some remote work if I am really awake and cut my losses when I need to.4. Learning **how I might be pathologizing sleep** is huge. Identifying why I feel the need to control my sleep. What are my fears.... What are my misconceptions? And asking myself if people can really tell when I'm tired and grumpy.5. A **general analysis to understand why I am stressed**. Similar to pathologizing things but instead focusing on constructive ways of dealing with my problems. Essentially, if you are happier with life, you might sleep better.6. Fully committing to be okay with a **lot of shitty nights** before it gets better. Especially if you are at risk of rebound insomnia from getting off drugs.7. Taking coffee only between 10 am and 11:30 am. Or between 1:30pm and 3:00pm. Look online about **matching your cortisol levels with coffee**. * NB: I actually like my Psychiatrist. Which is probably really important. I feel like I could easily cringe if I didn’t like them. ######CBT Therapy info:* It was about a month between being referred and the first appointment.* We talk for about 1.5-2 hours every 2-3 weeks* Cost Upfront: $150-180 * My insurance: Covered ~70%(Only for psychiatrists not therapists). I understand it’s not suitable.######Things that helped me outside of CBT:* **Taking a break from sleeping is huge!** It might sound confusing, but it’s just like when you are stuck on a problem at work or school. If you are restless, get up and read a book, play a simple game. Try sleeping again later. The longer time you spend waiting to fall asleep. The longer you're dragging on the process of staying up. * Don’t look at the clock if you can. I used a Kasia smart plug to turn on a low*light lamp at 1:30 to remind me that I've been waiting too long. If I fall asleep early, I don’t notice it anyway. * Reverse psychology. Plan stuff to do like shaving your face or folding clothes. Eventually you don't bother getting up do it anyway because your brain will want to do the opposite and you'll feel tired.* **Journaling** good and bad nights, and days when I decided to medicate (+dosage) helped a ton. * Losing memory from lack of sleep really sucked. It helped me feel a little more in control and track my progress. * It was good for finding triggers that caused my insomnia too. * It was also useful when talking to my family doctor about getting prescriptions (gives on objective view)* **Not giving a shit about blue light.** * There are so many factors to consider. Watching a to show or playing Skyrim at 2am relaxes me way more than the downside of blue light on my brain.* **Making a plan during the day**, and sticking to it during the night to avoid emotionally driven decisions. Making fear based decisions causes habits and addictions.* **Trying only one solution every two weeks.** Dont complicate your results with multiple things going on at once. Like don't try weed and sleeping pills at the same time.* Working out and eating healthy* After my bad days: Lots of sugar, electrolytes, and water. Gravol helps with feeling dizzy and nauseous during the day.######Things I tried but didn't help me in the long term:* **Melatonin**: If I did sleep with it, it was quality sleep, but didnt really regulate my circadian rhythm. Its also not super recommended by people in health care.* **Phenibut**: Low dosage was good for once a week to catch up on sleep but its fairly addictive. You get awesome dreams on it I must admit.* **Prescribed Indica Weed** was amazing at first because I didnt feel hazy the next day compared to Zoplicone but tolerance built after two weeks of continual use. Soon I was up all night wondering why it wasnt working.* **Zolpidem** had no effect at all even after doubling my dosage* **3.75mg Zoplicone** was my main drug of choice and was able to use it for 7 months without exceeding three days a week (as recommended)* **Having strict bedtimes**. I saw online it was good sleep hygeine to be consistent. This is true for the average person but I was so far gone that it was just another stress to worry about.
NotSignal	I have these horrible dark purple circles around my eyes that looks like someone punched me or something. I’ve never considered myself a particularly attractive person, but this fucking look doesn’t help.
Signal	Almost every night, I feel like someone is watching me. Maybe the energy in my room is fucked up, I don’t know. I saged my house. Who knows if that even works. I keep feeling like there’s a mini earthquake, and that someone or something is closing in on me. I can never get comfortable or relax. The silence is deafening. I tried to fall asleep to the TV but I couldn’t. I’m afraid to go to sleep. I get up and read, then try to go back to sleep. It’s 5am... again. The other night I kept accidentally jolting myself awake every time I started to fall asleep. Maybe it’s all this craziness mixed with the personal things I have going on in my life... but it’s unbearable. I get intrusive thoughts too and sometimes hallucinations. Does anyone else have this generally... unsafe, unstable feeling?
Signal	I honestly don't get any sleep, unless i nap for 2 hours during the day after activities and it's starting to weigh on my already cripplong depression. I've tried everything i know off i avoid caffiene like the plague, i have lavander oils and a comfy bed, no noise in my house, nothing is working. Does anyone have any tricks or should i see a doctor about it?
Signal	It’s really bad I’m scared to go trough a single sleepless night I switched from Ambien to zoplicone 3 days ago i abused Ambien and I feel panic attacks, Fear from the dark. I don’t know what to do.
NotSignal	Idk if this is the right place for this but fuuck itThe title says it allCan anyone relate, the only reason i have insomnia is because i used to do this all the time as a kid with my brotherId say my “best” experiences are driving home from school with old music playing and getting into the part of sleep where the rules start to dissappear and i have someone to wake me up in like 5 mins
Signal	one month ago I started my summer vacation and my sleeping schedule was not bad at all, and then I started messing up everything with naps at the beginning of September. I used to nap before for 3 hours and sleep 6 or so at night it was great but a strong heatwave made me unable to sleep at night. The heatwave ended 2 days ago and I’ve tried everything the past 3 weeks to stop my insomnia; basically I tried to cut out on naps, went to sleep in a cold room, I went out so I don’t sleep in the morning and sleep at night, I stayed awake for 26 hours took allergy medicine and went to sleep, and yesterday I stayed awake for 21 hours! All of these and I only get 2-3 hours a night and get super sleepy in the afternoon.The day I stayed up for 26 hours I woke up after 3 hours of sleep, I realized I woke up after 3 hours and had a very bad panic attack because I felt like I have nothing to do, I did everything.I really don’t know what to do it’s causing me so much stress I never dealt with such insomnia, I’ve had some days like that this quarantine because of university stress and some heatwaves from May, but it gets solved in a couple of days. I’ve been waking up and crying because of this stress I really don’t know what to do and my parents don’t seem to understand how much this is exhausting me and how much goals I had for this vacation that I couldn’t do. Please tell me what to do, talk to me about it, I feel so crappy I’m so stressed. This is supposed to be vacation I should be relaxing I’m so sad. The reason I’m not giving in and sleeping in daytime is because it causes me to end up in a depressive episode and I really don’t want that.
Signal	I literally sleep at morning and wake up at night, it’s a totally reversed sleep schedule it’s so hard to fix it, I have tried everything and I failed. Any ideas? Cuz I feel tired all the time
NotSignal	Is knowing im not alone in my suffering.I cant remember the last time I got mor ethan 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep.Chronic pain and anxiety rule my world. No med or doctor can help me. As I get older I'm just surrendering to a life of hell. Im falling apart.
NotSignal	Seriously, every damn time. I can feel it while sitting on the couch, I'm tired. My head is numb, I don't have any motivation nor do I want to. The heavy eyelids start creeping in, as well as the long and frequent yawning. My brain feels fried and I can no longer pay attention. All signs point to going to sleep, I make my way to bed.And as soon as my head hits the damn pillow, there you are. Working at full speed again, having some goddamn revelation. I'm wide awake again and you're turning like a freaking water wheel in a raging river! It's like having a shitty superpower where the only outcome is fatigue and misery. Why! Why can't I just fall asleep like a normal person! Why is it every time my head hits a pillow, I somehow feel like I've been rebooted. I've been living like this for year and I can't take it anymore. I've tired everything that doesn't involve sleeping pills (asthmatic can't take them) and yet here we are again. If I have to hear 'you just need to create a schedule' one more time, I'm going to lose it. I just want to sleep, why can't you just let me sleep.
NotSignal	Is there a certain time during the day where you cut yourself off from taking naps? It’s almost 3pm here and I could fall asleep on the couch right now. But I’m somewhat fighting it, if I can just last a few more hours then maybe I can sleep tonight like an actual human?
NotSignal	I don’t sleep extremely bad but nowhere near enough for me, I’m really bad at falling asleep. I finally got meds that help me stop overthink at night and make me feel more at rest. I tried them out last night and slept 10,5 hours (normally it would be 5-7 and I’d be tired throughout the day). It feels really nice to have time to spend during the day and not be extremely tired.
NotSignal	During quarantine i started a really bad sleep schedule and i only get to bed at 6:30-7am. I start my first year at highschool tomorrow and i’m nervous/excited about it and i’m worried that i won’t be able to fall asleep at all. Is there any techniques i could use to help me fall asleep? I know trying to calm myself would be the first step, but is there anything else i could do?
Signal	I have a competition with a 5am call time all day Saturday but my brain won’t let me rest, it fucking sucks! I know tomorrow will be a very long day but hopefully it’ll be okay.
NotSignal	So, every time I can't sleep I get the feeling that my brain is just thinking random things which I can't either catch nor get off my mind. I don't know how to explain it better, but basically it's like thinking the most random things (ranging from something unimportant I thought today to geometric shapes) without any logic or order, while feeling very anxious because of this uncontrollable thought process. Is this insomnia, is it something else?P.s. writing this at 6.30 am after falling asleep at 3 am
NotSignal	The past few nights I’ve fallen asleep pretty much as soon as I hit the sheets. However tonight sleep hasn’t come so easy. It’s the strangest thing ever too just out of no where I feel a boost of adrenaline and I can’t really explain it. I’ve tried many calming sleep techniques but nothing has really worked. Any thoughts?
NotSignal	I have had insomnia since I was a kid. When I was little I used to do my colouring books and when I was bit older I used to bake and clean. As a young adult however I struggle to find things to do at night. I have trouble sitting in one place for too long and as I have just moved out of my parents house I worry about disturbing my roommates sleep. This has always been a problem of mine day or night. I don’t tend to be loud but it’s still an anxiety of mine. I try to stay off electronics because they keep me awake so writing fanfiction is out of question and reading books isn’t much better. I get so soaked into a good book it’ll be three one minute and six another. I take valerian(melatonin free and the brand is luna) but my body adjusts and I have to come off them and by the time I can start taking them again my sleep schedule is again horrendous. On bad nights I usually don’t sleep period but then I will get anything between 8 and 12 hours the next night. I don’t take melatonin because I’m practically still asleep the next day. If anyone has any ideas on how to knock myself out par wacking myself with a pipe lemme know.
NotSignal	https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2019/10/24/lu1xjfsg8i9rzkatmnqgh2r9ykb0r1Thought this was a well written article. Hope it helps someone.
Signal	I have PTSD and insomnia. Both can keep me up all night. I should only take .25 milligrams of triazolam but i have to take .75 in order for it to work. Because of that, I run out very fast. I need a stronger sleep med. Any suggestions? Thank you ❤️
Signal	I'll start to feel tired and feel like I can't even keep my eyes open so I turn stuff off and then as I sort of doze off, my body will just fucking jolt and wake me right back up again. This is shit.
Signal	I know these are two questions but they are correlated for me. I have sinusitis which has resulted in anxiety and insomnia. Currently I am in this weird state where I am not sure how much sleep I am really getting. It takes me a while to go to sleep and I usually wake up within an hour. After that for next 2 hour or so I am in a weird sleep/awake state. I feel like I haven't slept but looking at clock I know there is no way I was awake for that long. After that I am awake for couple of hours and again I get some sleep in the early morning hours. I get headaches and lightheaded in the day but I don't know if it's sleep deprivation or sinusitis. I don't exactly feel tired but I also not super excited to do stuff. So I am thinking about buying some sort of sleep tracker. Probably withins pad since I don't want a wearable. How does your sleep deprivation feels like? Has sleep tracking helped anyone or does it just adds to the anxiety?Thanks everyone!!
NotSignal	Quick discussion as I post this at 4am. (yawn.) With self-isolation allowing for more flexibility with sleep and schedules, yet the worry and stress that comes with it and the coronavirus, what is your insomnia state due to the current circumstances?
NotSignal	For the love of god if you are an insomniac and have anxiety and panic attacks just don't google anything about insomnia unless it is self help related. Why are these articles even online. I googled if insomnia causes irreversible brain damage. Now I have to find articles that say it is reversible to calm myself. Does anyone have hopefull reasurring articles?
NotSignal	I used to have Hypnic Jerk about once a month before March. But ever since last night, i have about 9 a week in packs of 3 each night. I have been drinking energy drinks every other day but thats not even close to bedtime, around 5 is when i have one. Could something bigger be at play?
NotSignal	I feel like the Meeseeks trying to improve Jerry’s golf game XDGlad to see a board of non sleepers like me lol.At least hallucinating is fun.
NotSignal	Hello, i've allways had some sleeping issues pulling one all nighter every now and then, but 3 weeks into quarantene(going on 2 months now for me) i got really bad sleeping problems(i'd say it's better now but still not easy to sleep for me/issues 3-5 times a week). Just wondering who else is experiencing this(only quarantene induced please) and how you guys are dealing with it ..
NotSignal	I've read up on the benefits of sleep restriction for insomnia and It's said that the minimum amount of time to spend in bed is 5 hours. However, I only get 3 hours of sleep. Just wondering if anyone has any advice on what to do here as I feel like this method could be beneficial.
Signal	hi everyone, i have been dealing with a nasty bout of insomnia the past few weeks and have not gotten more than 2 hours of sleep the past 3 nights in a row. today (10 am) i work a 8 hour shift at my workplace. i am not sure what i should do... a) call in sick and explain i’m dealing with chronic insomnia problem (which is okay since i am entitled to 3 days sick leave protected by my province, and you are protected from being fired for using these 3 days)b) go to work and suffer all day (might go ok or very poorly) and talk in person to a supervisor once i’m there and let them know what i’m struggling with, so they can understand why my performance is affected c) call in to work and tell them what i’m dealing with recently and ask them if they would like me to come in or stay home
Signal	My insomnia started exactly five years in August on the second day of school junior year in highschool and I noticed every August it comes back; the weird thing is I never study or focus on school work, so I don’t even feel like it’s due to stress? I do notice wheezing when I try to sleep, but idk what it could possibly be????
Signal	Almost fall to sleep but my heart beat will shock me awake, fatigue, emotional, anxiety.Scare to sleepStarting Xanax 0.5mg as sleeping pill.#share
Signal	Talking to a psychiatrist and would like to root out anxiety and ptsd symptoms by attacking sleep first. Any meds that help sleep architecture reduce bruxism and grinding and allow the body to repair? Or is that more likely to be day time meds?
Signal	Last summer, I went on a trip to Europe and developed major issues with insomnia and anxiety. It took months to be able to sleep again fairly regularly and get my anxiety under control- going to a therapist, using melatonin to help sleep, and meditation. I’m feeling so defeated, because it has come back in full force this week. Two nights this week I’ve had anxiety so badly surrounding sleep that I haven’t slept at all- the physical pain from it in my stomach feels unbearable and the crying won’t stop. There’s the old feelings that something must be wrong with me and it’s not going to go away. Anyone else experience these thoughts at night when going to sleep? The thoughts that I’m not going to be able to sleep at all, being afraid for sleep to take over- almost like not being able to give up control, and here we go again- this is going to be bad. It feels so lonely in this sometimes especially at night when everyone else is peacefully at sleep.
NotSignal	Hi guys, I have never been able to sleep well. Every since high school and I’m now 27. I sometimes get 5-6 hrs and about 2-3 days a week only around 2-3. I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I was wondering if anyone has ever gotten anything they found that really works. Whether it’s behavioural , a device, excoriate , phycologist, vitamins, blue light glasses ect Any info for something that helped wild be greatThanks
Signal	Can't fall asleep because my body, head and chest feels anxiety-like tense. Got prescribed some medications and ambien among them with the purpose of knocking me asleep. After reading stories about this medication I am now afraid to take it, but if I won't take it I most probably wont fall asleep and have a shitty next day, on which instead I have to be productive. My question would be if 5mg of ambien is enough to knock someone asleep right away. I'm afraid that if it wont, I will have the known effect where if one remains awake on ambien shit might happen. And is 5mg likely to make one a walrus?
NotSignal	If you haven’t gotten this book, please try it. It’s helped me so much and it has great reviews on Amazon so I’m not the only one. It’s not a miracle cure and it’s not just sleep hygiene, it’s a whole revamping of your lifestyle to promote good sleep. Please please please try it.
NotSignal	Before I started working nightshifts I used to have trouble sleeping. Now I sleep at 12PM and wake at 8pm for work. I've never felt more energized. Being 180 degrees out of tune in terms of time with all my friends and family does have its drawback but hey, I can sleep like a baby for 8-9hrs a day now. Maybe you're just a vampire person.
NotSignal	Being able to decide when you fall asleepIs a super power. Change my mind.
NotSignal	Are there things that help aids with your falling asleep? I work nights which messes with my sleep but even before taking this shift. I’ve always had trouble sleeping. Even on my days off i get 2-3 hours a day because I’m asleep by 7 and up by 9. My body is tired but i just can’t sleep. Do you have items you’d recommend? I’ve done melatonin and CBD, neither worked.
NotSignal	Hi. It's already 5:30 and the sun is up. Should I try to go to sleep or just stay up. I don't feel tired. I usually stay up late but not like this. I've read about all of the stuff you should and shouldn't do withinf a certain amount of time before bed. Even if I do all of those things I don't fall asleep unless I'm really tired.Should I try and sleep or just stay up now? Its already bright so it will be more difficult to sleep now. I don't know what to do.
Signal	Can you have both sleep problems/disorders ?. I feel like I do, either that or I have Delayed Sleep Onset, and I find it hard to sleep in the day times because all the backround noise, and in general the sounds that promote wakefulness (things like birds, children playing etc....normal day time sounds). Its driving me CRAZY, the long nights, the un-restful sleep in the day, the short sleep times. I feel it's driving me to think about sucide, not as an impulsive thing, but as some type of a "rational" response to the situation I'm in. I did have a long term prescription for a sleep medication that seemed to have worked very well, but since stopping I feel very helpless, that I'm never going to sleep well again, or gain employment (I'm currently unemployed), or even be able to make small commitments to myself or others. I don't feel the thoughts of sucide are due to the withdrawal of the sleep medication, as it was done in a very medically controlled way. I feel these thoughts are due to nothing working (I have tried it all, sleep hygiene, apps, white noise, staying awake for days, hot milk, medical hypnosis, phone apps, antidepressants, low dose anti psychotic drugs .....you name it I have tried it over the years), I basically don't have any "tools" left in my tool box anymore. I have NEVER had any thoughts of self harm before, when I had a sleep aid/pill to use. I don't really mind about becoming "dependent" on a sleeping pill, I do care about tolerance to the effects of the drug though. I feel the benefits of a hypnotic sleeping drug outweighs the risks of being on one. I don't want to feel so helpless. Final note, both my Parents and my Brother, have had long term insomnia.
NotSignal	It makes it so hard to wake up, and go to work the next day. And to make things worse, my sleep schedule is so screwed up now. Last night I didn’t sleep into 6 am. Slept until about 1-1:30 today. Now I’m wide awake at 4am. Anyone else?
NotSignal	I used to be a pretty good sleeper. It's just stress and physical pain that's fucked with my sleep. Often it's the inability to yawn, breath deeply and easily, and not being able to get those comfortable positions that make me drop of quick.
Signal	Hi! I’m a 23 year old female and randomly two weeks i started to get really bad insomnia. A little bit of background, I do have Bi-Polar 2, and incredibly bad anxiety. It started with like my usual sleeping 4-6 hours straight, but then it sorta just changed. I kinda felt manic one night two weeks ago and stayed awake till almost 4 am and didn’t feel super tired. My anxiety is just so severe because i feel like this happened so suddenly, just three weeks ago i couldn’t keep my eyes open past 2am. Maybe it’s with all this covid 19 and not working, i don’t have anything to make me tired the way I’m use to being tired. Of course my anxious is brain is convinced I have sporadic fatal insomnia. Like convinced. I’ve had this anxiety twice before and insomnia kinda like this but not to this extent. Like i probably sleep 4-6 hours very brokenly. I tried melatonin, that didn’t work, Zzzquil also didn’t work? I slept like 2-2.5 hours on it but i woke up and I was like super shaking from anxiety and being cold???? What do I do?????? I just want to sleep like normal again, and I don’t want to be dying. I know I’m gonna tell my therapist on Friday to send that referral for a psychiatrist ASAP so i can get sleeping pills/ anti anxiety meds. The only thing that help put me to sleep (after I’ve woken up the first time) is CBD oil. But that’s at like 6-7am. I don’t have a problem falling asleep the first time!! It’s the other times! And I’ve had problems like this since i was kid, but normally i would’ve slept like 4-7 hours first. Please help!!!!
Signal	Feel really crap as I’m typing right now, and just want to sleep but I can’t. Didn’t get good sleep for about a week and have been staying up most nights if doing all nighters. I’m 19 nearing 20 and I don’t want this to continue. Nonetheless, during this insomniac phase my right side of my brain felt like something was rushing inside and it feels scary. It’s also preventing me from sleeping and I really need help. Been diagnosed with other issues like anxiety and OCD, and have an appointment with the therapists this week but I never trusted them.
Signal	looking for advice on a non addictive sleep supplement, i’ve been on a variety of prescription sleep meds throughout my life but stopped taking them as i became dependent on them. have a history of substance abuse so looking for something that couldn’t be abused/taken recreationally etc. i’ll try pretty much whatever at this point. for reference, my recent routine has been diphenhydramine(10-30mg) and melatonin (12-36mg) a night. not working anymore pls advise lol
Signal	I know I'm preaching to the choir when I say that I'm seriously exhausted, but as lockdown has gone on I've progressively began having a more and more difficult time sleeping. I wanna say that it's been about two weeks now where every night, consistently, I've been struggling, and it's starting to stretch me out pretty thin mentally. My routine has honestly changed very little, and for the first initial month or so I slept mostly okay (with a few rough nights here and there, most of those easily explainable by things like heartburn or anxiety), but within the past two weeks I'm just really hitting the fan.The only notable shift to my routine that I know is directly hindering my sleep is that I can no longer go to the YMCA and work out, and my attempts at jogging or working out at home just haven't been cutting it for me. I don't feel as exhausted exercising at home, I'm used to using the gym equipment at the Y until I'm basically in pain, so I just can't quite hit the same level of physical exertion.I know there's not much I can do about it, but honestly I feel like venting and compartmentalizing my thoughts on here like I am right now is at least helping my anxiety.
NotSignal	Finished up my school work early, ate dinner at a decent time, was feeling a little tired and ready to wind down.This was 6 hours ago, after the first 4 hours of just tossing back and forth with a blank mind it started roaming. By hour 5 I had come to realize 30 minutes wasn't even an option. By hour 6 and at the time of writing this I am getting ready for work and to start day 3 of no sleep. Let's hope tonight is the night!
NotSignal	I can't remember when it started but i can't fall sleep until 5 or 6am. I usually wake up at 3pm and the cycle just keeps repeating. I'm living in hell. When I try to go to sleep it's like my brain just has too much on it's mind and it's hell for me to go through. Please help. I'm sorry this post is short but these past weeks have been horrible for me.
Signal	I've struggled with insomnia for most of my adult life. This year I wanted to seriously work on that and see if I could get some semblance of normal sleep. So far my attempts have worked. Here is what I've changed: 1. First off, my doctor prescribed Melatonin - to be taken at sundown (where I am that's usually about 6pm, so might not work for people whose sundown is at 10pm!). I'm on it for a month to start off with to see if I can get my natural rhythm back.2. By far, the biggest change I've made, and the one that I think has made the greatest impact, is going to bed at the same time (11pm for me), and waking up at the same time everyday (8am for me), even on weekends.3. I stop all screen activity at 10pm, so I have an hour screen free to wind down before bed.4. I read a book that also suggested keeping the room dark, quiet and cool. For quiet, I use ear plugs. For darkness I use thick curtains, and for cool, I just need a fan for my area, sometimes don't even need that.5. No more afternoon naps. That was killing my ability to sleep properly at night.Getting started is quite painful. Lying in bed for hours on end the first 2 - 3 nights, not being able to sleep is painful. But resist the temptation to get up. Set an alarm to wake up in the morning and obey it. No turning it off and rolling back to sleep. Experiment and find the most ideal amount of sleep you need. 8 hours, doesn't work for everyone. Some people need more, some people need less. If you wake up naturally about an hour or less before your usual wake up time, then just get up anyway and stay awake the whole day.Those are my tips... I hope they help someone else.
NotSignal	Is it considered insomnia if your sleep schedule is messed up? Its really weird, I cant sleep at Night at all only early in the morning. Sometimes I do all nighters, but im scared that on the next day that I will be too tired to properly function so I just sleep early in the morning, but this is no good either because I have to do stuff during the day, which leads to me having just a little amount of sleep, yet the next night I still cant sleep at a reasonable time. This is all new to me and started happening just 2-3 weeks ago. Before that I had the exact opposite problem where I was tired all day and could sleep up to 20 hours a day. I basically fell asleep everywhere. Now I cant sleep at night. Is my sleep schedule just messed up or what is wrong with me? I already am in therapy because of other stuff and we are already work on my sleep problems, but now they want to give me meds for staying awake because I had that other problem before and now Im scared that I will get even less sleep. What should I do?(Its almost funny I have an insomniac friend who always told me: man I wished I could sleep as much as you. and I always replied with: I wish I could stay awake like you. Now I cant sleep and she cant stay awake and sleeps all das.)
NotSignal	Often, I find that I struggle to sleep because my mind is stuck on a certain subject. This isn't often related to something I'm worried about but instead a piece of fiction I'm currently reading, a game I'm currently playing, or a TV show I'm watching. It doesn't happen every night but when it does happen, I struggle to fall asleep and then wake up frequently overnight, with smaller sounds and movements waking me. This is something that's been happening to me for years. Tonight it's Doctor Who. Does this happen to everybody else? Is there any words to help describe it? I've seen the term mind racing but it doesn't feel like it applies as that refers to worries and anxieties.
Signal	So I have been wondering if I can take 6mg + 400mg of l-theanine at night to help me sleep?I usually get only 3-4 hours of sleep and then can't sleep at all. I was on Loranzep 0.5mg for a month which helped and now trying to come off of it. Any side effects for this??
Signal	In the year 2017 I was traumatized by an event and it led to acute stress disorder which later developed into post traumatic stress disorder. It came with all it's symptoms! Insomnia was one of them! We're in 2020 I'm still taking antidepressant because I can sleep normally! I want to be able to sleep again! I want to start taking drugs every night! Someone should please help! 🤒🤒🤒🤒🤒😫
Signal	Obvious throwaway because I don't want to link my substance abuse problems to my main account.Many years ago, I discovered an extremely effective hack for falling asleep: alcohol. To a lesser extent, sleeping pills. So basically I would get drunk every night so I could sleep, maybe top that off with some pills. On the rare nights I didn't drink I'd double down on the medications. It has been an odd many years of life not of demonstrating a pattern of alcoholism that anyone I know has been concerned about but of a definite pattern of chronic abuse that has been mostly very private.Many years later, naturally, I've developed a variety of health issues from my steadily ramping intake of alcohol and depressants. Most everyone is familiar with how drug tolerance works and I am a case study. I am now pretty much immune to sedatives; 10 mg of ambien, for example, didn't make a dent, and my alcohol tolerance is astonishing. So I've been trying to sleep clean. Which means I haven't slept for two days. I feel lousy, but at least I'm not hungover.I've been lurking in this sub and I'm posting for the first time. I notice many people just post stories to get things off their chest. Maybe I am just looking for some support. I might post again next time when I feel like drinking to fall asleep. I have tried support groups for alcohol abuse, but I never related to them; I just don't understand the cravings, lack of agency over your life, all of that. My enemy is sleep. And I want to have a good night of sleep more than anything in the world. Maybe this community will understand better what I'm going through. Thank you for reading.
NotSignal	And vomit, I’m so anxious it’s ridiculous my whole body is on high alert
Signal	i’ve tried multiple. closest thing I got to helpful was ambien but 5mg wasn’t cutting it and my doctor wouldn’t prescribed 10mg. this is torture.
Signal	Even if I'm super tired. I just don't fall asleep all the way. I know it's just anxiety but I don't know how to not be anxious, and the more often I don't sleep well the more anxiety I have. It's annoying because I'd finally slept for 7 hours, the best in a while and thought it was gonna start getting easier. Then something happened yesterday that gave me anxiety and I went back to being too anxious to sleep.
NotSignal	I’m only 17 and Every single night I cannot fall asleep until about 1:30-3 am. Even if I turn off all devices and sit in my pitch black room I’ll stay up for what feels like decades still wide awake just to check my phone and find 45 minutes has passed with no progress. I physically can’t fall asleep until some random force decides alright it’s bedtime and I have a huge wave of just exhaustion. Since quarantine my physical exercise has dropped a bit but even before I wasn’t even close to being able to go to bed until like 2-3 hours of focused attempt at sleep at around 1 am. When I do fall asleep I sleep very soundly until about 10, 10:30 if I’m lucky. But once I’m up I’m up for the day just to go through the same nonsense all over again. So long story short I just have a VERY VERY hard time falling asleep but once I am I’m sound and get a decent amount of hours. Would something like melatonin drastically help this or is the possible side effects I’ve heard about (making it harder to sleep without melatonin or wild dreams with melatonin but none without) outweigh the benefits. I’m seriously wide awake right now contemplating giving up on sleep for the night
NotSignal	Imagine falling asleep within a few minutes every night and waking up refreshed enough to actually drive without risking your life as well as everyone around you.
NotSignal	Why some nights are like ok and other nights up every 2 hours
Signal	I've had insomnia for... 7 years? I at least remember having it young... like middle-school years. Now, I'm about to be 21. And it's been pretty tough living in a slowed down world where a picture of my cognitive ability looks like a sky full of huge, dawdling storm clouds.It isn't the worst. I've read posts where people are awake for days, sometimes weeks... and I genuinely feel for you guys, being aware of how minor my insomnia could seem to someone else... But my version of it acts up fairly often. I guess if I were to average it, it typically takes me about 2 hours to fall asleep every night. Though I've had nights where I can sleep in 1, and many, many more nights where it can take the *whole* night... The worst waves (Where I would just sleep a couple hours to something like 5 every night for multiple weeks) have always come and gone, never sticking around for multiple months, though I would say that I have always been sleep deprived since developing insomnia. And there's likely a few years built of sleep deprivation there. As of right now, it's got me sleeping around 4 hours a night for about 3 weeks now.This isn't something I want to continue into adulthood though... Likely my insomnia was developed through intense stress suffered throughout my adolescence... which also likely amplified any bad sleeping habits I had throughout those years. What I'm saying is that I don't think my insomnia is genetic- meaning there could be a way to "reverse" it? Preferably in a natural way?One thing people talk about for relieving insomnia are Rx pills, in which case I do have some Trazodone that I probably could take more of. But I would, if possible, like to stop having to *need* to take them. If there is a better, healthier way (mentally as well as physically), I'd like to try it, and hopefully it sticks.I've paid attention to my sleeping habits before. I guess I could get a little more exercise to help out, but I've never been a caffeine or an energy-drink person, and I've stuck to sleep schedules fairly decently in the past. But it seems even when I would do this, insomnia would still randomly strike. Though, admittedly, I probably wasn't in the best places in life until recently, so this might have just been due to extreme stress outweighing all of my efforts. I'm now trying to establish a sleep schedule as permanent as I can make it. I am aware that this is likely the most important thing for an insomniac to follow... It's just that, admittedly, young life tends to happen fast and is extremely just... completely random at times, especially when you decided to move and enroll in university a year ago... This makes it a little hard. So, even now my sleep schedule isn't the most stable...This then leads me to the idea of meditation... And I actually meditate quite often. I've been doing so for a couple years, increasingly getting better at it I suppose. I'm sure it didn't help me in the past as, admittedly, I wasn't very good at it when I started, haha. However, I'm looking into ways that meditation could actually benefit those with insomnia. And there seems to be a lot of good stuff associated with it. Excuse the lack of technical terms here, but I've been reading something about meditation helping people with insomnia lose a lot of their mental edge, helping the mind kind of "drop its barriers" and allow it to better drift off into a sleep state. As it seems insomnia is a very harsh inhibitor to the brain's natural ability accomplishing this on its own. I wish I could find the link to this... it's been a week or so since I've last done the research- so that whole last part might even be completely false.But has anyone actually managed to do this? Completely "reverse" their insomnia through tons of meditation paired with tons of nights practicing the absolute best sleep hygiene, etc? Have some of you at least made your insomnia better by doing these things? If not meditation, what works for you? And what are any other tips or tidbits (on meditation, insomnia, sleep science, etc.) you could give to me and the rest of us in the community?Honestly, I'm all ears to all of it.
NotSignal	Dear lovely insomniacsIT GETS BETTER I was diagnosed with insomnia in 2015 and I thought my life was over, I was getting 2hrs every two days and I skipped a lot of school. My anxiety sky rocketed and I closed off from a lot of my loved ones because I felt like I wasn't human. But after 4years on various different medication and participating in various trials I can say that it gets better! Last night I can confirm that I slept 10hours without the aid of any medication what so ever! Disclaimer: I am still on meds which I take once every two days but I have a reduced dosage nowadays I know it's really tough and I know it's horrible with everything feeling so out of your control. But it will get better I promise, science and medicine are progressing like crazy and who knows one day there could even be a cure. Bit for now please don't give it up even though the darkness creeps and all you want to do is just let go but you have to hold on. All my love and support to you all and I wish you all the best for the future 💞 -Girl Getting Better
NotSignal	Hello all,Bit of background; after 2-3 years of sleep impacting my work I was finally sent to Occupational Health and my work GP after never getting anywhere with my own. Had a few sessions of CBT-I and whilst insightful I had already tried a lot of their suggestions and changes.I have now been given a psychiatry referral and will be following up with my work insurance to get all approved.How did other people kick off their care? Was it similar? As I go further down the rabbit hole there is an anxiety at the back of my head that my own GP knew this was all leading to the same place I started with hence not much from them.
Signal	First things first I’m 22, out of school (for the first time in 4 years from college), I have anxiety and depression (cuz ya kno they go together so well) and I have a hard time falling asleep and then once I finally do (I’d I do) I can’t stay asleep. There’s so many restless nights where I roll all over my bed, wake up grinding my teeth, and when I wake up in the middle of the night I can’t fall back asleep, or at least not for a couple of hours. I feel as though my problem started with stress from school, with assignments and due dates keeping me awake at night - at some point I was on Trazodone but I found that it would help me fall asleep but not keep me asleep (I’d get about 3-5 hours and then after waking up I’d be wide awake unable to fall back asleep) - my mom gave me a weighted blanket recently and it helped me at first but now it’s become somewhat of an obstacle for my tossing and turning. I find myself getting more depressed the longer I stay up. If anyone has any suggestions for stuff that helps you fall asleep and staying asleep I’m open to anything
Signal	I made a post about my issue a few days ago. curious if there is anyone here who is like me. who sleeps the full x amount of hours. but the quality of sleep is just really terrible. I sleep. but my quality of sleep is like I've only slept for an hour. and it's really light sleep. doesn't feel deep at all. headaches and eyelid twitching 24/7. blurry / tired vision, too. mental fatigue is through the roof. early-morning awakenings, too. Does anyone else here have this? And if so what do you do to alleviate it? Please tell me your story. thanks.
Signal	My insomnia goes like this(I think it likes to play tricks on me)Go to bed at 12am brain is all like extremely exhausted and I fall asleep super fast.4am comes and my brain is like “Yo did we just sleep 8 hours? ... doesn’t matter, WAKE UP YOURE NO LONGER TIRED. So I toss and turn for hours on end thinking I can go back to sleep. Nope, just suffering. Pisses me off so damn much!!! I go to sleep fast but wake up fast. Great.
Signal	I’m becoming very frustrated. I’ve been through so many meds... they tend to work for a while and then don’t. Do people live on rotations of meds? Like remeron one week, seroquel the next, remeron again, etc. I’ve been through the basics, melatonin, Advil PM, Benadryl, hydroxyzine, remeron, ambien (I tripped out on it while awake after a couple weeks, never again). I’m scared because I just know soon I won’t feel it at all. And I’m not sure there’s much after that and that scares me. I’ve been having insomnia since I was 13ish? (I’m 21 now) and the last few years it has gotten worse. Unmedicated, I sleep 2-4 times a week and usually only for a few hours. I feel drained and tired but just can’t get to sleep. Advice?
NotSignal	My psychiatrist prescribed Buspirone after experiencing bad side effects with another anxiety medicine. He told me to let him now if I wake up in the middle of the night ready to start the day.I’m normally a late sleeper.When The early morning wake ups were only occasional and I’d go back to sleep, with a rare sleepless night.(Basically my body decides “We are AWAKE NOW!”)Now it’s almost every night and I can’t go back to sleep. I’ve suffered from insomnia for 15-20 years (?). I don’t want to change medicines, since this one has the least number of side effects and is the least life threatening. It also decreased my constant nightmares.Any ideas? Anyone else having this problem?
Signal	It was sometime past midnight when I took my 10mg melatonin, I have 3mg and 10mg, i choose depending on how long I have to sleep. I was already exhausted and hoping melatonin would pull through this night. Long story short, I drifted in and out of consciousness uncomfortably and checked the time at one point, 6am. I didn’t manage to sleep the whole night. My mind was active the entire night and I was groggy the whole day. Thank you, brain. I really appreciate it.
NotSignal	I think the worst part of my insomnia is the few people that I have in my life to talk to are all asleep so I’m just up for hours alone. It just makes me feel like shit and makes me spiral really hard into my anxiety
NotSignal	I can’t stand this and it’s such a crappy feeling. Sometimes I feel like my brain just enjoys torturing itself! How many of you guys go through the same thing?
Signal	Hello, I suffer from occasional insomnia and by that I mean getting 1 sleepless night a month but in the last week or so I’ve had 3 instances where i was struggling to sleep. I think the major reason is my anxiety that I’m not gonna sleep so to try to cure it I’ve tried breathing exercises but they haven’t worked because as I’m doing them I’m aware that i need to sleep therefore it is counter productiveAny help would be appreciated because I think it’s beginning to take a toll on my mental health and also I’m returning to work in about a week so god knows how I’ll sleep then haha Thanks for reading :)
NotSignal	I will suffer from occasional insomnia. Not bad or sever. So this method won't help with extreme insomnia but here it is.1. Take a relaxation pill. It can be sleep medicine or just something to relax idc.2. Watch a TV show. Tv shows from your childhood, kids tv shoes, or something like AFV or Animals Doing Things works3. Drink 3 cups of warm milk or warm almond milk4. Cuddle with a pet5. Do a sleeping method such as counting sheepHope this could help someone
Signal	28 years male. Always had fucked up sleep timings throughout my life never sleeping and waking up at consistent times but never really had any problem falling asleep. 5-5.5 hours of sleep was enough for me and I had very good energy levels and physically active 3-4 days a week.Lately due to COVID, i have to stay at home and I am not nearly that physically active anymore. I had bad sleep for 1-2 days last week (barely 1-2 hours) as I was going through some stuff mentally - existential crisis and also had a bad fight with gf which lasted a couple of days. Not being able to sleep 1-2 days caused me to overthink sleep so i made it a point to fix my schedule which i always procastinated about. Now I am going to sleep by 12:30-1 am and waking up by 7ish. I also started taking melatonin 3 mg from past 2 days which made me sleep easily but next day i wake up not feeling refreshed, feel very foggy and can't concentrate on work or think clearly.I find myself crap, then researching about sleep whole day and feeling anxious when i have to go to bed. I dont have too much caffeine, barely 1 cup coffee post lunch and that too not everyday.Kindly help redditors. Should i give up melatonin or decrease the dosage perhaps?
NotSignal	Spending the whole day extremely tired and ready to sleep but as soon as your head hits the pillow you have a surge of wakefulness until the next day comes around. I haven't slept a full hour in two days and I am just in a perpetual state of wakefulness while not gathering any information from my day. Hopefully I will be able to sleep tonight, even if it's only three hours I'll be happy. Damn I hate this and there isn't anything that has worked, have a good day everyone and thanks for passing by.
NotSignal	Please tell me I'm not the only who stays up worrying about sleep because I can't sleep making the problem even worse, just to sleep 5 minutes before my alarm goes off
NotSignal	Mine was staying up for two whole days and can’t falling asleep. These has to be one of my top all time nightmarish experience of not getting two days of rest. And how do y’all train to know that this is your anxiety acting out and not some bullshit stuff like fatal insomnia.
Signal	I’ve been struggling with insomnia for over a year now - I have it nearly every night. It’s been nearly disabling because I feel AWFUL most of the day. The cause for my insomnia is unknown, but it doesn’t seem psychological at all.One thing that’s interesting is that my blood pressure spikes at night - not to dangerous levels, but it’s high. My doc says blood pressure is actually supposed to lower at night. Does this happen to anyone else? I’m wondering if this spike in blood pressure is related to my terrible insomnia issues.
NotSignal	someone help me understand what is wrong with me, i haven’t had a good nights sleep in a week and tonight was awful, normally it only takes a couple hours for me to fall asleep however tonight nothing seemed to work, i even took more melatonin than usual, why does this happen, im literally having very mild hallucinations from this melatonin but it isn’t making me tired and i cant fall asleep.
Signal	Hey all. I’ve been plagued with chronic anxiety for years now. I’ve tried many different sleeping pills and they all suck in the long run. I do deal with generalized anxiety so I know this is a huge contributor but lately I’ve had it in check. I’m currently forcing myself to wake up at 6am(although I’m usually already up before my alarm goes off) and I go to bed when absolutely sleepy. Usually between 12:00-1:00 am. I’m five days into this already. I’ve been averaging under four hours of sleep a night but despite this I have been very optimistic. I exercise in the morning and meditate daily. It’s also been months since I’ve stopped all negative thinking towards sleep. My question is this. After four or five nights of barely getting sleep I notice I start to get super exhausted and sleepy at night but once I hit the bed I feel alert and if I do start to doze off I start twitching and my heart jolts and wakes me up. I feel the lack of sleep from the previous nights stresses my body out and causes my body to produce a lot of cortisol. How am I supposed to deal with the physical stress of not sleeping. It’s a vicious cycle. The sleep restriction places your body in a state of stress that halts any progress possible. Ugh! Thank you for letting me vent. Considering getting back on SSRIs. Was on them years ago and I used to sleep like a log but it came with a price. (Side effects)
Signal	I can't sleep, whatever I try I just can't, this is the third day I am going through with the minimum sleep. I sleep maybe 4? 3 hours. I just couldn't sleep, I only stared up into the ceiling. My mom says its because of the phone and blue light yada yada, but that specific night I turned my phone off at 9 so logically, it can't affect me for several hours until like 2 am right?Let's make a list of what I have experienced so far:- nausea (when I am trying to sleep I feel like I am going to vomit, this feeling lasts the whole day )- no appetite ( I just cat get myself to eat )- I am extremely tired - I can't concentrate - no sleep (ofc)- I am really sensitive to light ( everything just feels really bright)- I have no energy to do things Please, help me. I am trying to make her see that I have a problem. I don't want to include depression on the list because I am not 100% sure if I have it.i know I do self-harm that's a but related to this because I just can't live with this and I want help. She threatened to take all my electronics away just so I could sleep, but I know it's not the electronics fault. Please, I am begging you, help me I will let her read the comments so please, please please I really can't anymore and I want anything that will help me sleep.
NotSignal	Anyone else having a really hard time falling asleep?? I mean hours and hours to the point of a sleepless night?? I actually don’t know what to do it’s pure hell
NotSignal	Does Trazodone retain efficacy over time for insomnia or will I start to notice drastic drops in it's efficacy? Anecdotes & empirical evidence appreciated.
NotSignal	Anyone up I can chat with? It’s now day 3... and I haven’t been able to fall asleep until around 7-9am. It’s currently 2:53am.
Signal	I know most of you have tried everything under the sun to go to sleep. I know I have lol. From drugs to laying on my cold tile to try and trick my brain into thinking my bed is incredibly comfortable. Eventually I got prescribed buspirone for general anxiety. Apparently my sleeplessness had to do with anxiety because it has been helping tremendously. I recommend giving it a shot if you haven't yet. It doesn't make me 'feel' anything but i've had full nights of sleep since beginning it.
NotSignal	I think I've gotten little to no sleep unless you count sleep in the day in two or so weeks.I'm pretty sure this negatively affects my health and my question is if I can recover from this
NotSignal	I’m just curious. My mom has suffered insomnia all her adult life, and she often feels sleepy and takes naps after lunch. But my insomnia is different, I never felt sleepy but I feel very tired (especially mental fatigue) and I'm completely unable to take naps.
Signal	I’m so tired, I’m so sad, I just want to sleep. But whenever I turn off my phone and close my eyes, I keep rethinking such mean things to myself. I tell myself that I’m never supposed to fall in love, and that I’m a terrible person and never good enough, and people don’t fall for girls like me. I rerun these things in my head until it hurts my chests and I start crying. I literally hurt my own feelings. Please tell me I’m not the only one
NotSignal	It’s been happening for a week straight. It’s not deep sleep but it’s something that made the night go quick for 7 hours. I’m calling it light sleep cuz I don’t feel fully rested like I use to. And I’m yawning all day even tho I don’t feel sleepy. When I “wake up” I just open my eyes and get up like it’s nothing. I hope this is fixable or else my brain is gonna get fucked. I’ve been avoiding sugar and exercising more and nada. So anyone else on here? It feels like I stopped producing melatonin. I need to get it checked
NotSignal	New to the sub, please excuse if I have the vibe wrong. Ironically, I didn’t sleep last night, so function is down tbh.So I’ve had sleeping issues for most of my teenage/adult life but I feel like they’ve really jumped up since I’ve started university. I’ve been trying to figure out why I can’t sleep but I’ve only come up with a few instances and explanations:- I keep staying up “too late” (I.e. I have to be up in five hours or so) and then giving up because I feel uncomfortable with my sleep not being more than eight hours (like it feels like it does not compute and my instincts say just don’t try)- I feel like I’ve become addicted to getting to go to bed when I’m absolutely knackered and I’ve started leaning more towards staying up all night in order to achieve this. I’m going through some stuff rn and this feeling is honestly probably the best thing I can hope to experience in my life as it is now but I feel like it’s probs unhealthy bc I’m skipping lectures and stuff to sleep because I missed the night before.- I have trouble not thinking (has always been an issue, and I’m currently looking into ADHD but I’m not certain?)Anyone with any knowledge or personal experience know if there’s anyway I can fight this stuff? Would appreciate it :)
NotSignal	So I know I’m not the worst insomniac in the planet but I feel like I’m reaching it day by day. I want people to share their stories. I feel alone like I’m the only one who’s struggling with little sleep.please share them.
NotSignal	After I’ve been laying here for a few hours I get panic attacks and strong suicidal thoughts And urges. If I’m dead I’ll be able to sleep and won’t be exhausted anymore. Like I genuinely would rather die than deal with this. My psychiatrist even said she doesn’t know what to do for me anymore. We’ve tried almost everyMedication and nothing works. I can’t do this
NotSignal	Alright so, last month i had my worse batch of insomnia i’ve ever had. I’ve always been a naturally rough/light sleeper and with this batch of severe insomnia i didn’t sleep for 2 1/2 days. Ever since then i’ve found it nearly impossible to get to sleep before at least 5am (some nights 7am). I’ve tried a lot of stuff but nothing’s really working. I know about circadian rythems and stuff so is this insomnia or just me going to bed later? Before my insomnia i would usually decide to hit the hay between 2:45 and 3:00 am.

NotSignal	For example, an extended family living in the same house - if the house has kids who play early in the day and it disrupts your sleep. Or someone who plays a musical instrument next to your bedroom in the late morning. Note that these are leisure or exercise activities. I wouldn’t ask anyone to stop cooking lunch.For 6 months last year I had a good sleep streak but this month it’s spiraling back. I used to be able to sleep through my insomnia. Because of the recent pandemic, everyone is at home and bored.Is it reasonable to ask them to adjust their time? Or should we be the ones to sacrifice because we are the ones who don’t have a normal sleep schedule?
Signal	I don't understand. I've got 3-4 hours of sleep (or maybe less) in 3 days and I'm still functioning fine. Small headache but nothing major yet. I genuinely wonder what will it take to make me feel the lack of sleep & make my body sleep.
NotSignal	People snap a PIC of their watch at 4am and I'm thinking "that's nothing, I have been up since yesterday. lol
Signal	I've been having these nights where I'm tired but I just cant or feel comfortable. I feel like I can fall asleep but I just jerk back up. Anyone else?
NotSignal	Last night, I didn't sleep at all, however, I'm not tired or sleepy. It's currently 5 pm. I read enough on sleep and insomnia that I know it's due to hyperarousal but I'm actually scared that I won't be able to sleep tonight too because of it. How do I stop being hyperaroused? I'm afraid it's just gonna cause me more sleepless nights and that it's never going to end. Thanks.
NotSignal	Last night I woke up and I knew I was sweating since my shirt was wet. It was strange, I slept for a total of 6-7 hours of sleep but woke up 2 times during night but was able to go back to sleep.
Signal	hi there so for a few months I haven't been getting restful sleep at all. I would have probably slept 2 or 3 hours a night but I wake up in the morning thinking I didn't sleep a wink. It affected everything. But I ordered gaba supplements from iherb. One capsule of gaba and 2.5mg of melatonin makes it way easier for me to fall asleep nowadays. Pls do try it!! Both supplements are natural!!
Signal	So my insomnia started with a panic attack that lasted days, never had one that intense before. I vomited and legit thought I was dying, went to the ER but they just acted like I was a drug addict. They were no help at all. Fast forward to 6 days later. I’ve finally been sleeping the past 2 nights with the help of Advil PM and melatonin together. If I don’t take the pills I then just lay there and if I start falling asleep it’s like my brain stops me from falling asleep. It’s so strange. Finally spoke to a psychologist and they prescribed me trazadone. We’ll see if that works better. Does anyone else’s mind seem to stop them from going to sleep? It’s just so weird to me. Never had trouble sleeping before.
Signal	I didn’t take my sleeping medication because for some stupid reason I keep thinking “oh maybe by some chance I’ll actually be able to fall asleep tonight on my own” as I now sit here at 3am unable to sleep at all. It’s getting to the point where I’m going to get fired from my job because I’m so sleep deprived all the time. Why can’t I just fucking be normal 😭
Signal	Hey guys so tonight I’m just having really bad anxiety that it’s triggering my insomnia pretty bad. I used to take tarazadone but it makes me so nauseous I had to discontinue the usage. I’ve been doing pretty well but tonight just seems impossible. Any natural or other remedies to help get to sleep?
NotSignal	Ever since COVID started I’ve been on a bender. Probably not alone in my thoughts for that but this bender is starting to takes its toll on me. I’ve been drunk or high every single night since March. With the exception of maybe 5 days. The drinking is starting to take a toll on my body, I’m (M20) and in pretty good shape except for the sweet love handles I’m getting. I when through many different phases of this bender. It started as just heavily drinking for maybe all of March. Then I smoked all the time in April and May. Then just started getting crossed the rest of the summer. I’ve just started to cool down a little bit the smoking and I’ve just hit a wall. I’m unhappy with how I’m starting to look because of how much I drink. It’s unhealthy for my body and my mind. I’ve built up quite a tolerance to both. On average I’ll have an entire bottle of wine in a night or at least 5 drinks. I would prefer to smoke every night but I feel like recently drinking helps me sleep better. I’m a anxious person and take adderral for my ADD. My mind is never clear, I have constant random/ridiculous/off-topic thoughts all day long (especially at 2 a.m.) I find that drinking or smoking before going to bed puts my mind at rest for a lot of negative thoughts. I want to stop drinking to focus on my health. I don’t think I’m an alcoholic I think I’m just depressed. Smoking helps more because I don’t wake up hungover and I enjoy it more. Any advice?
Signal	So I contracted a virus this feb while on a cruise. Thank God I have recovered from the main symptoms of the virus, but it really threw me for a loop emotionally and mentally. I have had lots of secondary symptoms ever since. I am not sure of my body got depleted, but the stress was overwhelming and I developed insomnia the last month.I have gone through bouts of anxiety before, but not long term where I needed to constantly be on medications. My doctor prescribed low dose xanax .25 and ambien 10 mg. I can now consistently get some amount of sleep with ambien, sometimes with 5-7.5 mg. Once in a while i can fall asleep for 3 hours or so without it. So I've been using ambien rather consistently for a month but I'm worried about being dependent on medications to sleep. Also makes me groggy and anxious the next day, and not feeling like myself. I just want my sleep to return. What is your experience with insomnia and these medications? How to restore my sleep?
NotSignal	Lately I've been getting dark circles under my eyes and feeling ligjt headed constantly.I'm not sleeping in fear of another night terror which i have every time I sleep. I usually sleep 1-2 hours a day and no more, sometimes none. I have been rude to people without noticing and don't feel like doing anything
NotSignal	I only slept 2 hours this night, from 2am-4am. I took two melatonin pills yet still woke up a couple hours later. When I wake up from sleep it's nearly impossible for me to get back into it. I took another melatonin pill but unfortunately have been unable to sleep (trust me, I spent an entire hour and half lying in bed trying to.) So now it's 7 30 amI have to study for my finals this week, so I would love if my brain could cooperate. Yesterday, I slept a 10 hours after the previous night was another round of insomnia. Is anyone else dealing with nasty insomnia during quarantine? It might have to do with the sedentary lifestyle I have now (barely leaving my desk). Or anxiety - I have run out of my medications (I still feel like I should be able to sleep though?) I don't know.
Signal	I have been getting maybe 4-5 hours of sleep a night for the past few weeks. I've tried everything I can think of to help me get a good night's sleep but nothing is working. I'm so tired, and I'm tired of being tired. When I do fall asleep, I wake up tired. I'm lost.
NotSignal	For some reason my insomnia has been bad these past few days. I mentioned my puppy that I care for which makes the insomnia somewhat beneficial. Now my oldest dog is getting neutered tomorrow and I’m anxious about it. Definitely what’s keeping me up tonight. Hope you guys can get some well deserved rest tonight.
Signal	Pretty much the title, but I'm so exhausted. After an hour, I wake up wide awake. I’m just curious if anyone else experiences this or can offer some advice because I feel like I’m going crazy. Thank you in advance.
NotSignal	Did I fuck up? Like is this dangerous or am I able to sleep tonight without a problem (I’m afraid to sleep so I need help:()
NotSignal	Whether it were self-inflicted with a bit of help (if you can call it that) from the 'hurry-up' poor man's packet (speed), one too many 'Cecil Gee's (Ecstasy pills) a proper bit of shovel..... or just could not sleep.... For no apparent reason. And list the above examples in best to worst predicament to find yourself in... Myself personally... the first scenario is by far the worst.. it was only the once..... and only coz we run out of shovel!! 😱😱🤪🤪🤪🤫🤫
Signal	I’ve been having sleeping issues since I was about 4-5 due to a childhood trauma. (It wasn’t anything huge. Just really shocking news.) I grew up with terrible anxiety and depression but I’ve grown to “deal with it” better now. I’m currently 24 it’s like not sleeping is what my body has grown to be accustomed to as it had been for the past 20 years and I’m incredibly tired but I still can’t seem to fall asleep at a decent hour. I’m writing this at 7.18am and switched off my laptop at 2.30am. I sometimes can’t help but think whether my circadian rhythm is off or it’s insomnia. And recently, just as I’m about to fall asleep my body would jerk me awake or weirdly my mind would conjure up a really loud noise like a scream or a bang, interrupting my sleep. I’ve tried many things like calming music, reading, sleeping pills (which worked for a short period of time until I needed a higher dosage which made me stop), alcohol (occasionally) and even breathing techniques (in my opinion was the worst. It made my heart beat so fast and I would end up with a panic attack.) The only sure thing was smoking weed but from where I live it’s illegal and don’t easily come by. I’m so sick of sleeping at 7am and it really messes me up when I hear the birds chirping outside and I’m not even remotely close to falling asleep. My body and eyelids are tired though. My brain just isn’t. What do?
Signal	Hi all.I've had insomnia for a few weeks now and I don't know what to do. I've been getting awfully anxious whenever I'm getting to bed and even if I calm myself down, I somehow pull myself out of sleep (out of 'excitement' that I'm about to sleep) and then suddenly any tiredness I feel is gone for a good three hours or so. I've been consistently getting at most three hours of sleep every night and it's killing me.To make matters even worse, I've also read on fatal insomniac disease and it's freaking me out.I've taken melatonin and it hasn't helped me in the slightest.Do any of you have any tips on how to handle this? I really would love to be able to sleep again.
NotSignal	With the hot weather I’ve been struggling to sleep, struggling to stay asleep and struggling to get back off to sleep, but last night I woke up from a dream and was fully in sleep paralysis. It was strange because I knew what was happening and had been through it before years ago - but it felt like I was on some of the most powerful drugs I’ve had in my life. Like a K hole.I was laying on my side with my hand by my face, my mouth was open and I could see my partner sleeping next to me. I tried to speak and my tongue wouldn’t move and my throat just groaned. I knew if I could move my finger and touch my face it would break the sleep paralysis but it was like a giant waterbed was weighing down all my limbs.Eventually after I strained, I moved my hand, touched my nose and immediately the movement came back to my body and I could turn over again. It took my almost an hour to get back to sleep because of how aware my mind was when It was happening. Very strange is all I have to say.
Signal	Hey guys... those of you who have been through severe chronic insomnia (6+ months or greater, I myself have been dealing for over 10 months now) and largely gotten through it and are sleeping mostly normally again...How long did it take for the cognitive impairment to go away and/or did it ever go away at all? My sleep has improved quite a bit in the last few months but it's still not great. I fall asleep around 11pm and sleep fine but often wake up in the very early morning around 4 or 5 am and struggle to fully fall back into a deep sleep... usually the remaining sleep until 7/7:30am is very shallow. Still have some nights where I sleep very poorly. Back at it's worst at the beginning of this year, I was barely sleeping at all for weeks at a time. So there's been a lot of improvement. CBT-I has helped tremendously.My biggest concerns have been my working memory and learning ability... I have pretty severe ADHD so my working memory has always been quite poor but I've been able to get through life just find for the most part. Since this insomnia however... I feel brain damaged. My ability to retain information and recall events are almost completely gone. I can be in a conversation with someone and have no idea what they are saying to me sometimes. I barely even remember the past few months of my life, hell I can barely even remember what happened yesterday.My verbal recall is horrendous, I am frequently afflicted by the "tip of the tongue" phenomenon when speaking or trying to remember something. There have been many times I feel as if I am in a waking dream and reality doesn't seem quite real, though that's been more rare as of late. A few months ago, there were points where the brain fog was so bad, I could barely function or interact with other people.I know no formal studies have really been done on humans with chronic insomnia (I believe) so we don't really know the full implications that long term sleep deprivation means for neurological health... but I gotta say I am terrified I have permanently damaged my brain from the lack of sleep. I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression too which has not helped whatsoever.Have other people been through this and did they recover with consistent sleep?
Signal	Hey guys!does anyone have experience with using melatonin for treating maintenance insomnia?no problem falling asleep but I often wake up at around 4.30am and can't fall back asleep for about an hour, sometimes 1.5-2 hours.**when trying to treat maintenance insomnia, should you take the melatonin when you wake up or should it be before you go to bed?****Is it better to use one form of melatonin over the other (regular vs slow realase) for that matter?**thanks ahead and sleep well!
Signal	I am really, really tired of my current situation. I would fall asleep after hours of overthinking and trying to shut my brain down, to begin having multiple nightmares about either loved ones screaming really insulting or hurtful things about me, or surreal, disturbing imagery of something chasing me.When this last one happens, i force my body to wake itself up. In my dreams, i am absolutely self-aware but i do not have any control over it somehow. All of my senses feel completely real, the threats too, even if i know it's just a dream. I get really frightened knowing this, and i start moving my real body frantically until i wake up really agitated, anxious and start shaking and crying uncontrollably.This lasts a couple of minutes until i calm down, but at this point i made sure to be really awake so i would not fall asleep right into the nightmare again that i can't be able to sleep for a couple of hours again. This got me getting up from bed at 3 or 4 am these last days, only getting either 4 or 2 hours of sleep at night. Of course i couldn't be in exactly a great mood after all of that, so i just spent hours doing nothing or listening to music because i can't bring myself to do anything. Then i start feeling sick, and decide to take a nap around 8 or 9 am until lunchtime, but i absolutely fail every single time though i'm trying really hard. I would realize it's 5 pm too late, and even then, it's a really hard time getting up. This is really affecting me since **i just fixed my sleep schedule after a similar problem i had the past weeks**. Not only that, i'm supposed to be studying for important tests i need to get done to finnish a couple of subjects left of highschool. But i'm failing every one of each of them because of this and a shit ton of anxiety i'm getting. I'm feeling like a complete failure around my family and friends because they believe in me to work hard and pass but i just can't bring myself to do anything right.Some of the nightmares just reassure these thoughts. And i can't stop feeling strongly guilty about it because i'm also making my mother worry about my health.The worst part is that this isn't anything new, i've been having sleep issues since a very young age. When i was a kid, around 5-9 years old, i would also have constant nightmares that woke me up but i could go back to sleep if i asked my older brother to stay with me for the rest of the night. I stopped having nightmares for a couple of years after that but at the time i developed a lot of anxiety that made me impossible to fall asleep in the first place, which it's still relevant until today.I've been reading this sub for a while and i've got a couple of tips i want to try out to fall asleep sooner- But i don't know if i can do anything about my nightmares anymore. I don't even know anyone that has similar experiences especifically like this, or years of struggle that worsened their mental health.I just want to know if there's a way to cope with this or make it less worse? It's been destroying me deeply for months now.I'm sorry in advance if this has a weird grammar or broken english, it's not my first lenguage.
NotSignal	I don’t know what’s up, but lately I sleep for 3-6 hours max, and when I wake up I am not always able to sleep. Does anyone relate?
NotSignal	I haven't had a dream in over a year and it's weird because I was always a very vivid dreamer and now I don't anymore. Does anybody else suffer from pains like pins and needles and joint pain from lack of sleep and really bad constant pulsating headaches and vertigo?
Signal	First post here, but lifelong insomniac. I have been med free for about two years, and was doing really well. But recently, my son expressed that he was having trouble sleeping. He specifically said he feared the part where you slip into sleep because he didn’t know when it would happen. And that was/is an age-old fear of mine. He unknowingly brought it all back for me, and my new sleep troubles began that very night. After struggling for a few weeks and taking Unisom (and some Valium, which did nothing), my doc gave me Trazodone. Night 1: slept 9 hours. Night 2: slept 0 hours. Was I just exhausted the first night? Does it take a few days for Trazodone to work consistently? Does it even work?
Signal	I started suffering from insomnia a couple of mounths back.. i have no problem falling alseep whatsoever but i always wake up in the middle of the night and cant fall back asleep.. this cycle is really starting to worry me and can lead to some anxiety and stress while trying to fall asleep.. I've been on Zoloft medication before because of obessive thoughts.. im thinking about starting on medication again because i have so much worries about this sleep cycle.. do you think this will help with my sleep?
NotSignal	Yeah. That happened last night. It's the worst my sleep has ever been. Trying to enjoy the day as best as I can.
NotSignal	I've never been that skilled at getting to sleep. I was a very anxious child, and had a fairly stressful upbringing where I was quite isolated and under a lot of pressure at times. This caused me to secretly self medicate with sugary foods, which were banned in my household. Now, after having moved out of home for almost a year, I still can't kick the bad habit of staying up late and indulging on sugar and caffeine. I've quit alcohol within a year of University, as one teeny tiny drop can cause me to stay awake until 8 or 9 in the morning. The past few weeks have been characterised by the worst sleep of my entire life. I just want it to get better. So I'm trying to have less sugar, and less light stimulation late at night. It's kinda hard though, as a university student. There's a lot of peer pressure to indulge recklessly to the same extent as others. It's so strange that what is viewed by society as shameful later in life is actively encouraged as an 'experimental' phase in youth. I don't know a single person that has a healthy relationship with alcohol or food. Maybe society and the economy (exacerbated by the events of this year) is too stressful to allow for normal human physiological processes to function well. I just want a good night's sleep, goddamn it.
Signal	Promethazine works, but I’m paranoid about taking meds...tolerance, withdrawal, whatever brain changes it’s causing, etc.The alternative is basically not sleeping more than an hour a night. Yes I’ve tried just about every thing else to help.
NotSignal	so it’s 4:30 in the morning. I used to have a mouse in my house who would scurry in and out of my bedroom and i would only ever see it out of the corner of my eye, and if I ever saw it directly it’s fast and jolting movements were strangely unsettling.And tonight it happened again, I have another mouse apparently. This shit is hell on my anxiety, I cannot have shit scurrying in and out of my room out of the corner of my eye.I just want one good nights sleep please
Signal	My normal schedule is like... Morning: EatRest of the day: Mundane activities (due to Coronavirus.)Then I'd try to sleep around 11PM. Constant pain in my head. I try again, and again. Most of the time I get this static sound that floods my ears and it gets painful. Also, the lack of sleep gives me headaches.I'd wait till 6AM, to where I'm extremely restless and the pain has become numbed. Then I'd sleep.Then wake up at 10AM. And repeat. A cigarette sounds nice right now! Reason why I'm posting this is because I promised a good friend that I'd get some sleep. But the same bullshit happened.
Signal	Hello, This week I've been suffering from insomnia. I slept one night worth of sleep this week. Summary: I'm dealing with many issues in my life. The home isolation isn't new to me because I've spent many years of my life in a some sort of exile from the outside world at home. I have depression for many years and all sorts of other problems. Before the Coronavirus started, I did have an improvement in my mental state but now I had to come back to my parents' house and it is very difficult for me now cuz it feels like I'm in square one. In my depression, there were times that I didn't eat, shower and stuff for a very long period of time.But only on rare occasions I've had cases where I couldn't fall asleep. In the past years, sleep has become less of an adventure and more of a "let's get this over with" kind of thing. Throughout my depression I've often switched hours to being a night person. I had and still have little control about this and many other things. I hate going to sleep late though.Before this insomnia started, I had a week in which I went to sleep everyday at 5-7am cuz I was depressed and playing video games uncontrollably. I tried 3 times to switch back by staying awake the following day and it didn't work because I either couldn't fall asleep or just kept playing and staying awake. But after the 3rd attempt, this week started. And I just can't fall asleep anymore. I got 2 hours of sleep on Wednesday evening and a few more on Sunday and Monday. But except that, nothing. My body feels very tired but nothing out of the ordinary for me so far. It is my mind that feels the tiredness and the mental issue that comes with it. I've tried some herbs or whatever yesterday and it didn't really help... What should I do? Thank you.
NotSignal	I would like to see a chat room where we can complain about lack of sleep and just talk about anything.
NotSignal	Which one is best for insomnia? And which one have less hangover feeling next day?
Signal	Every night I get in bed around 10, play some games for a bit, then around 12 get ready to sleep. I don't actually fall asleep lately till around 2-ish, as I toss and turn a couple hours before actually falling asleep. I just feel so cooped up, agitated and stuck. It takes me a while to calm my mind down, but I feel like I sort of going crazy here, and now when trying to sleep I feel like I could just jump out of bed out of pure agitation. I hate this!
Signal	I am extremely TIRED to the point that I cant keep my eyes open. I, however, cannot SLEEP!!??? cant even nap I need help it's so frustrating. Can U still take melatonin? I usually take 3 mg should I take 6 mg? also should I pair it with magnesium glycinate thank you.
NotSignal	its almost 4 and i dont know what to do so i guess i will have a staring contest with a fan to dry the crap out of my eyes and idk
NotSignal	I don't use Xanax often. It's for emergency panic attacks. Would it be useful at that dose in this situation or not worth it l?! I just want to sleep...
NotSignal	It helps for me to listen to soft music with lyrics because it helps me keep a sense of time so that I dont feel as if Ive been laying down too long. When I dont have music I am constantly checking the time. Does this help anyone else?
Signal	I'm on a very low dose of Cymbalta currently (only 20mg, but plan to move up) in the morning. My doc prescribed Trazadone to take at night to help me sleep (I'm sleeping approx 1.5 hours per night). She said that Cymbalta and Trazadone are safe to be taking at the same time.However, I have read that serotonin syndrome is a risk (although rare). Does anyone have any experience with taking both?
Signal	Hi ,I started to wakes up very early in morning ( never had insomnia) Can’t sleep more then four or five hoursThe issue is when I wakes up I am not fresh and During day I feel sleepy but can’t sleep againAlso feel little nauseous ( all symptoms when we sleep less) Nothing change in my diet or lifestyle.I don’t drink coffee , I always have tea with stevia around 9 .30 pm in last few years . This is not something new.Not any stress and made my room very comfortable to sleep and I take unisom pills in last few years before I sleep . Also I take at magnesium dinner . Please help meI don’t have health insurance to go to DR.
NotSignal	Title says it all. Right now I’m close on 2 months of not sleeping that great but my actual problems started around 4 years ago.
NotSignal	I have a call appointment with my doctor at 4:00pm today and i cant miss it. But its 4:19am now. Should i go to bed now and hope that i wake up before 4:00pm, which might be possible, but only if i fall asleep now, or should i try to stay up the rest of the day until the appointment, get through it, and then just succumb to sleep deprivation?
NotSignal	I am at a point at work where if I try to do sleep restriction my performance is going to suffer and I likely wont be retained?Any other highly successful tricks that dont include restriction?
NotSignal	Spouses/partners of insomniacs, how do you deal with the day-sleeping?! I never see him these days cos he crashes in the morning and doesn’t get up until I wake him at 4pm. He doesn’t help me do chores or anything and doesn’t work so I feel so alone. I’m starting to resent him...
NotSignal	hey y’all!my insomnia has been worse since quarantine started (as i’m sure many peoples have because is time even important right now?!) ANYWAYS, i feel like my lack of sleep / sleeping too late has impacted my anxiety and depression A LOT. i feel like i’m on auto pilot most of the time,is that even possible?
Signal	I've had a ton of stress. We all have. I've had more than I can handle for sure. Definitely starting to shut down completely and all I want to do is sleep. Except a muscle spasm there an anxious thought there and other issues and side effects to medications here and there and now the birds are chirping. I feel like I'm stuck in some gamers tiktok video listening to the birds every freaking morning. This has been going on almost a week now. I'm about to go insane and I can't see another doctor until Thursday and definitely not going to an emergency room because I'm sleepy but cant sleep.
Signal	I don't know if it has to do with insomnia but, I think very much, random stuff that doesn't make any sense. It can take hours until I get a little bit of sleep. Then it's like 5 in the morning to 9. Sometimes I talk to myself like random shit just to make myself tierd. I'm not sure why I write this down but it feels good writing.I'm 23 and I'm ashamed for not sleeping normally. I don't like this.
Signal	Hey fellow insomniacs! So for the majority of my life, I’ve feared falling asleep. Mainly because I *know* I will not wake up on time, or hear my alarms unless I drink a shit load of water before bed, or fall asleep 12 hours before I need to be up. When I was younger, it wasn’t to bad. But as of lately, it’s evolved into more of “I can wake up to a few different alarms if I sleep on my back, but my brain will not shut off, fuck.”I have ADHD, and my mind is always racing, my medication does help, but I cannot/ do not take it at night. So, because of this I’ve found myself on a rather odd sleep schedule. Throughout the week, I sleep every other day. Or I’ll squeeze in a series of 30 minute naps throughout the night. (Waking up every 30 minutes to make sure I won’t be late for work, or a day work was very physically demanding. some days I often burn between 2100-3000 calories. Not sure if this is exactly healthy, but it works for me, although I’m afraid to let my family in on my schedule, because I am worried they’ll assume I abuse my medication and force me to stop taking it. Plus I am a natural night owl, I wish my job operated at night, I would be set for life. Sorry for going a bit off topic, I tend to drag on with useless information lmfaoTL:DR I’m afraid I won’t wake up on time in the mornings so I sleep every other day and go to bed 12-14 hours before I need to be awake to ensure I naturally wake up on time.
NotSignal	Currently 20 and I’ve had it since 16; when I was 16 I told myself it would be gone by 20....; now not to jinx it but I really wonder the same with 24...it’s so fucking annoying especially when you’ve done everything to figure out what the fuck is wrong with yourself; I just want to SLEEP
Signal	I have a very strange relationship with sleep. I can fall asleep with my lamp on and 4 mg of melatonin perfectly fine but my eyes are never rested in the morning and I wake up so much during the night. When my lamp is off I can’t sleep by myself at all but when there’s someone sleeping next to me I can fall asleep really well in the dark without melatonin and my eyes are a lot more rested in the morning. I’m almost 17 now and the fact that I’m still afraid of the dark is really annoying. Last night I only got 3 hours of sleep because my eyes and forehead were too tense to relax and sleep which was most likely because of my lamp. When I covered my eyes with my blanket they felt better but I was too paranoid and afraid to sleep like that because of the darkness. And because i’ve had this lamp for years, I can only sleep alone with this specific amount of light on, and trying to slowly dim the amount of light in my room does not work and I still am too paranoid to sleep. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I should do? Because I’m never well-rested anymore.
Signal	I've been struggling with insomnia for the past few months, seroquel helps but sometimes that even won't put me to sleep. The thing is, right next to my house there's a church with a loud church bell that keeps me awake because it rings every half an hour and because of this i always am conscious about the time which makes the anxiety worse. I've masked the ringing sound with some background noise on my TV and i slept 7-8 hours the past 2 days without drugs. I'm so happy!
Signal	i used to be the type who couldn’t fall asleep or stay asleep, but i didn’t have to worry about sleeping through the weekends because i couldn’t stay asleep for more than an hour at a time. sure not fun but sure something. these days i’m off of benzos but pretty recently, on seroquel (highest dose i can be for sleep) when i started noticing i couldn’t fall asleep i went up to that and started taking melatonin again which definitely interacts and make me drowsy, but i still can’t get to fuckin sleep. my meds seem to make me able to stay asleep for 7-8 hours but don’t help me fall asleep whatsoever and i’m not sure what to do. weekdays i have to get up and i’m falling back into only sleeping for 4 hours just because of how long it takes me to fall asleep, and weekends i guess i can sleep in but not always and i just feel weird if i sleep past 11. i’ve tried literally every med on the market which is why i’m on seroquel, benzos help but again i just quit them, they’re expensive and i’m tolerant.. it seems sometimes i’m restless and other times i feel drowsy but still can’t get to sleep. ill often realise i’m finally relaxing and then jolt myself awake unintentionally and get struck by random anxiety thoughts. my symptoms of sleep deprivation are coming back and i can hardly type this.. fairly fed up. i don’t need help staying asleep or falling back asleep, i just need to fall asleep to begin with because this will fuck my life up. i’ll try anything honestly, i’ve probably tried it all already but i’ve got time considering i go to bed around 11 and can’t fall asleep until after 4 😂..
NotSignal	1:45am I've been awake over 48 hours, I thought I was going to fall asleep a few hours ago but my brain is having none of it! Yay!
Signal	Idk how many of you experience it but I'm often stuck in a constant loop where I sleep horribly (or not at all) until around 9am. At which point I have to get up to do stuff, but I know that it's the only time I'm gonna get a decent sleep, so I'm in bed snoozing until 1pm. I feel good and rested and then the realisation that I've wasted the day hits and within an hour I'm completely fatigued again. But once normal person bedtime hits, as tired as I feel, I know I'm not actually gonna fall asleep because I just slept during the day again.How do you get past it? Trust me, I've tried forcing myself to just get up at 9am and go what I gotta do. Turns out I can barely function the entire day and Im basically useless anyway because the brain no work.
Signal	I have struggled with my sleep pretty much all my life, I'm a guy in my 20's and have diagnosed anxiety and depression and have been doing CBT but avoiding medication (SSRIs do not agree with my body). Whenever I go through a stressful period my sleep and appetite are the first things to go. Things have been stressful lately and I often take OTC promethazine and diphenhydramine to sleep. I have taken zopiclone in the past but doctors won't give that easily (and rightly so). I find some of the drowsy antihistamines helpful, but obviously they build up tolerance after a few days. Does anyone know of a schedule of taking them that can help limit this? Could I take promethazine one night and diphenhydramine another to avoid tolerance to either one? If I take promethazine 3 or 4 times a week is this enough to make it stop working and how long would I have to stop taking it before I can take it again? I know taking medication isn't a solution but in times of crisis I need anything that can support. Thanks!
Signal	I fell asleep 4 hours before my original time I also slept like a baby. Whenever it’s a boring podcast or some boring Netflix show I find it very officiant and tbh my insomnia started since I turned off that tv. Is it just me?
Signal	Lately, I've been getting sleepy and falling asleep around 3am. Which is annoying, but at least it's been consistent so I can work with it. The problem is that it appears that overnight snow removal is also consistent. The city clears the parking lot for the community center across the street every night that there's snow (so lately, every night). Around 3am. By the time the flashing lights, plow clanging and back up beeping stops, it's been 45 minutes and I can't sleep anymore.If you need me, I'll be cursing at the weather channel until they give me some snow-free days in the hopes that one day I'll get to sleep.
Signal	Now 6:30am after another night of quarantine insomnia and this sucks :) I can’t fall asleep for sure with the daylight and the morning noises, today’s gonna be fun
Signal	I've had chronic insomnia for 11 years now (I'm 19), and have tried everything. I was sent to a sleep specialist who said they couldn't treat me because I didn't have special needs. I'm so exhausted to the point where I can't keep my eyes open but I still cannot sleep. It's so frustrating!
Signal	So, I've started having insomnia since the beggining of this month. I used to sleep well before, would sleep 10h straight easily but since a rough night where I woke up at 3AM and couldn't fall back asleep, my sleep quality has been going downhill ever since then.It started with simple difficulty falling asleep. It would take me at least two hours to fall asleep. Then I would wake up 4-5 hours later and would try to fall back asleep to no avail. It remained like this until recently. Somehow, I can now fall asleep easily but I'm waking up every single damn hour of the night and it's making me feel worse than before and I don't know what to do. While I'm definetly sleeping more hours, my sleep is extremely fragmented and broken.My question is: Has this happened to anyone else? If so, did you get it fixed? What should I do?I'm a college student and I can't keep going like this. Not only is this making me miserable, it's also ruining my studies and my relationships with people. I feel irritable all the time and have to stop myself from lashing out against everyone and everything around me. I just want it to stop and any help or insight would help. Also, please don't suggest melatonin. Just don't.
Signal	The past week I’ve been waking up every night at like 4am, I’m totally fully awake, and my mind starts racing through the most trivial thoughts (career, money, family, goals) except everything feels extremely depressing and pointless! It takes me like one hour to get back to sleep, and when I wake up again everything is fine and I’m excited about stuff. What the hell?PS.: don’t know if it matters but I was depressed for most of my life. Started therapy two years ago and now I can say I’m starting to resemble a responsible functioning adult 😂
Signal	I am pretty sure I'm extremely depressed. For the past month, I can't sleep more than 1-2 hours before waking up. I lay awake for a long time, and if I'm lucky, I'll fall asleep for another 1-2 hours, etc.Does anyone else experience this? I have read that insomnia can be a symptom, but I have been able to fall asleep lately. Just can't stay asleep.
NotSignal	So I’m on my 6th day of my insomnia, my doctor prescribed me a CLONAZAPAM but its side effects is learning impairment and slow reflexes. And I don’t want that. Now im stuck in the dilemma: - low my IQ down to sleep Or-preserve my IQ and insomnia will eventually go away. My family doesn’t understand me :( i hope you guys suggest of give me sum tips coz i want to fucking sleep. I wanna go back to the old times where i am constantly sleeping.
Signal	This isn't all the time but often when I have insomnia bouts I can't get to sleep until 6am or later. I've never worked 3rd shift. I don't get it.
NotSignal	Why is it we insomniacs have to fight for the basic things humans get its not fair and ppl don’t even care. Some say “It’s good you can’t sleep I wish I had that so I could do all nighters” as if we aren’t fucking tried too thinking about chugging a whole bottle of sleep pills as if that would help. fucking why and ppl say don’t cry over sleep yeah ok you try not sleeping for 3 days your Billie eilish fan girl ass would survive a day before bawling out to your songs.
Signal	Okay, I know what caused my insomnia. It was my anxiety!So, like, this is really weird. But i read an article once about what your brain does when your asleep and it freaked me out so bad! Then i was afraid to go to sleep, and nso i didnt for a while. and now i have insomnia!Wtf?!?
Signal	TL;DR: My sleep schedule makes no sense now that I’m quarantined and I can’t do anything about it.My sleep schedule is now nonexistent, and I’m suffering for it. I was doing fine when I was going to school, but now without anything to wake up to and the fact that my plethora of mental illnesses are getting worse under the strain of quarantine, my circadian rhythm makes no sense. For the past few nights, I’ve had sporadic naps that last anywhere from 9 PM to 2 AM (I’ll fall asleep at 10 and wake up at 12 one night and fall asleep at 11 and wake up at 12 another night, or any variation thereof, or it’ll be like today where I don’t nap) and then my body refuses to sleep until 5 AM, and then I’m waking up at 2-4PM. I’ve tried just staying up after the sun comes up, but I literally cannot do it, I pass out hard. I suffer from depression, GAD, PTSD and gender dysphoria, and I know that has a hand in this, but I still had these issues years before and my sleep schedule was fine. Ever since my state went on lockdown (we’re pretty much out now though, but my mom is too paranoid to let me go anywhere) my sleep has been suffering. My health isn’t the best either now because of all this, my back hurts like hell, Im getting headaches, I’ve essentially ceased to be hungry anymore, I feel weak all the time, my chronic GI issues are getting worse, and I generally feel sick. I’ve tried a few things to try and stay awake during the day and sleep at night, but not much has helped. I tried these dissolving melatonin tablets I had on hand and they did some weird things to me. I think it might have interacted with my medications because I couldn’t stay asleep and I had some crazy dreams. I tried zzzquil and it didn’t do much for me. I’ve tried energy drinks and caffeinated things like soda, coffee and hot chocolate during the day, but they either don’t do shit for me or make me feel very nauseous. I guess nowadays, at least for me, an unemployed high schooler with only Google Classroom assignments to care about, there’s no real need to have a consistent sleep schedule in terms of time management, but I’d like to have one for the sake of my mental and physical health.
NotSignal	Starting this month I went a whole six days without sleep and I felt terrible. Muscles twitching so often it became irritable. Abnormal heart rhythm, long story short I’ve been lucky to finally “fall unconscious” at night.I can’t really say it’s sleep because it kinda feels as though my mind is completely active but all the symptoms went into ease. I’ve made it an unhealthy habit of looking into sporadic fatal insomnia which is very rare, I know, kind of stupid thinking that I may have it since it’s so rare. Although one of the symptoms is vivid dreams when achieving sleep and that just so happens to be my case. If I do eventually get sleep I seem to recall the dream very clearly. Do you guys also get that? Is it nothing to worry about
NotSignal	He has the audacity to walk in, lay down, *and start snoring almost immediately.* It's like he's mocking me
NotSignal	On top of my dumb extreme weight loss I've also developed several AIDs and it seems that an early sign of said autoimmune diseases can be insomnia. I had a steroid shot at the er yesterday and slept and even had a dream.
Signal	I (27f) have had trouble sleeping since I was 15. It got worse when I was 17 due to some health problems (Celiac, food intolerances, etc) I developed, which are now under control. However, my sleep troubles continue to get worse.I can fall asleep, usually takes me 15-30 minutes though, but my main trouble is staying asleep. I wake up 5 or more times during the night and struggle to go back to sleep. It can take me anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to fall back asleep. If I wake up around 3am or later, I might as well kiss sleeping goodbye, because around that time my body refuses to go back to sleep. Sometimes it’s so bad I only get a few hours of sleep, which makes me feel like an exhausted zombie the next day.The only time I find that I have a good nights rest is when I go about 2 weeks of bad sleep, then take some Benadryl one night (tried it per doctor’s suggestion). The Benadryl trick only works every few weeks or so.I have tried melatonin at different doses, L-theanine, GABA, and even diffusing essential oil blends. Sometimes the essential oils help relax me, but don’t prevent me from waking up repeatedly.Are there some things I can try or things I should do? I’m sick of feeling so tired all the time.Also, not sure if this is a factor, but I have been told by my mom and my boyfriend that when i’m sleeping my breathing is so slow and quiet it seems like i’m not breathing.
NotSignal	Yesterday I didn’t sleep at all and stayed awake throughout the whole day. I thought that tonight I’ll definitely sleep because I’m sleep deprived but now it’s 2:20am and I just cannot sleep it’s horrible I’ve been awake for well over 30 hours.
Signal	I’ve been doing 30-50 hour days, I can’t fall asleep, not even with my strong sleeping pills (Ambien and others). I’m hallucinating regularly at this point. I see shadow people and hear voices. That’s how sleep deprived I am. If you have any advice please share! I would appreciate it so much! <3
NotSignal	I sleep on average 4-5 hours/night. Its been going like that for 2 weeks now. I have onset and maintenance problems which are probably psychological. I also stopped to take any kind of medication/supplement for sleep 2 weeks ago. Prior to that I had been through a really rough bout of insomnia (tons of sleepless nights or only getting one hour through the night) that got fuelled by anxiety.Is there anything that I could try that could make me sleep more? If I could get up to a constant 6 hours a night, it would be a blessing. I’d like to continue to sleep without medication/supplements.
NotSignal	I've been sleeping every other nigh, only 4 hours. Now I havent slept in 3 nights and my joints hurt and I have chest pain. Can't call the ambulance because of co vid. Im alone, im afraid to die alone.
Signal	And I thought it would really help with my bad mood because the night before I didn’t sleep and only napped for an hour in the day so I thought that part of the reason I’ve been so much more depressed and anxious was because I was exhausted. I slept last night for 12 hours (woke up a lot of times but went back to sleep quite quickly each time) and since I got up I’ve cried for 40minutes and thrown up from anxiety. I just don’t know what to do. Everything I do to help myself doesn’t seem to make any kind of effect on my life!? Really frustrated with myself and life. Really depressed. Really sick of it.
NotSignal	I’ve reading and reading books, yet my mind will not shut down.... I’m thinking about making my husband breakfast but he’s a cozy and asleep.. ohhh well..
Signal	Background: Struggled with sleep all my life (love/hate relationship), frequent all-nighters as a teen with video games. Last five years, occasional bouts of chronic insomnia, managed inconsistently with Trazodone. Throw in hormonal issues like testosterone replacement (which keeps me wired all the time), it got to the point where I was sleeping 3-5 hours every two days at times. My anxiety was through the roof.Finally decided to confront my fears about sleep, because I felt like shit, performed like shit at the gym (despite being propped by by testosterone, which probably tanked in the first place due to poor sleep habits), and long-term sleep deprivation wasn’t doing any favors for my physical and mental health.Picked up the book outlining the Harvard CBTi program. The first week sucked, and I had a couple of bad nights and got little overall deep sleep, even with Trazodone.I think I might have had a breakthrough. The past couple of nights, I had that familiar pulse of anxiety when lying down in my bed. I have just learned the “4-7-8” breathing technique, which I find very relaxing, and this has calmed me down the past couple of nights, along with daily and consistent meditation practice. The sleep scheduling and stimulus control is finally starting to work. My overall anxiety, especially bedtime anxiety, is starting to decrease. I obtained 5.5 average hours of sleep (per night) over the last two nights, and actually got a bit of slow-wave sleep last night (which had all but disappeared)!Two nights of decent sleep in a row is a small victory, but I’ll take it!!!
NotSignal	I suffered from disrupted sleep since I was 8, anyone the same? Do you think that it could stunt height?
NotSignal	I didn’t take a sleeping pill but even when I do it doesn’t work. I went to bed at 11pm woke to at midnight and been awake ever since!! I have to go to work today. I could go to the gym but idk lol not feeling it I’m lazy lol 😂 anyone else awake and want to chat. Message me or respond to this please save me im so bored lol Max
NotSignal	I find I'm only really sleepy during the day. I've always been this way. Anyone else.
NotSignal	What I firstly would like to share is that in the last few months I’ve been battling with anxiety a lot, however these last few weeks have been amazing, and mostly anxiety free. Well during that anxiety full period I could sleep pretty well, sometimes i had some nights when i couldnt fall asleep, but rarely. However, this week has been bad (sleep-wise). Allthough during the day I’ve been happier than I ve been for a long time, it’s the 3rd time in 4 days that I wake up at 2 am and cant fall back asleep. This has never happened to me... My insomnia usually is to be unable to fall asleep not to stay asleep, and that ‘type’ of insomnia would happen rarely, 1 time a week tops, (i havent had one of those sleepless nights in about 2 months). What should I do to stay asleep?a
Signal	So yesterday I finally visited my family doctor and told him I have been having sleeping issues ever since my mom has passed away (3 yrs ago) and told him that I have tried melatonin, and slowly moved up to nytol, unisom, any over the counter sleep aid available. I have also tried exercising which consisted of a personal trainer for three strength training sessions/week and cardio (run on the treadmill) weekdays evenings. Even with the exercising I was still downing melatonin. I have regular therapy sessions to regulate mood. The doctor was surprisingly very attentive and very caring, he ordered a blood test and told me to go back in a few weeks to discuss options .I felt so proud of myself to address this problem to a professional and finally feel like I am taking a step in helping myself further.Until my bf dismisses me by saying “well, you should’ve just exercised more, you’re not even trying to fall asleep on your own and only relying on pills” :/ I fking wish I had the energy to exercise lately (running on barely any sleep) and for fk sakes I have tried everything . Its so heartbreaking to hear someone you trust dismiss a a horrible thing and imply your just lazy. Sigh.
NotSignal	Anyone out there who regularly only sleeps about 4 hours each night? Sometimes I nap in the day and sometimes I don't - so not really sure if I count that more than 4 hours. But my sleep is just regularly poor in general. Quite often I might get a few hours at night and a few in the day (e.g. after work). I have no idea why my sleep is broken up like this. Anyone else?
NotSignal	I feel exhausted but wide awake. I feel like my brain is using my eyes as trampolines trying to knock me out
NotSignal	It's my first day at a new job in 5 hours. I don't feel tired at all, and i don't have anything i can takeSomeone tell me i can get through this
NotSignal	What do you all do to help calm this and get some shut eye. I’ve found myself in a situation where I just need to take it a day at a time , but it just happened. So my brain is just going off and worrying and just making me sad yet I can’t stop thinking enough to get some shut eye .
NotSignal	whenever there's any sort of event (holidays, end of school breaks, concerts, vacations, anything outside of what i'm used to) i can't sleep at all. i already have insomnia and it runs in both sides of my family, but nobody in my family experiences this. i just can't stop thinking about what's going to happen the next day whether im excited or anxious, and it really harms my ability to do well in these situations. i don't really know the point of this, just looking if others experience the same thing and what they do to try to remedy it.
Signal	i just started on 25mg of hydroxyzine for my insomnia. so far, ive noticed that when i try to go to sleep, i see this weird, fast flashing light behind my eyes and when i wake up in the mornings it’s almost as if my anxiety and depression are enhanced in a way. it also hasnt really put me to sleep like my dr said it would, if anything im waking up way more frequently throughout the night. has anyone else gave hydroxyzine a try and would you say it benefitted you in the long run? i’m also taking it with 30mg of mirtazapine if that matters.
Signal	Hello,I am a dolphin.I have applied the power of when schedule for my chronotype for 10 days.The wake up/sleep time are fully dialed in and I don’t have any insomnia. But I am tired all the time! And it is getting worse and worse. I am thinking about dropping the whole thing and getting more sleep. I am getting seriously sleep deprived. Anybody else is a dolphin and has a feedback on the power of when schedule?
NotSignal	From last few weeks I am not able to get 8 hour slee, I am only able to sleep for 4 hours, I always wake up after 4 hours. So I sleep 4 Hours in Night & 4 Hours in Evening. Can it affect my health? If yes then how can I fix this issue?
NotSignal	I am so tired of ema. So tired.I’ve done all my tricks to fall back asleep.I have to go on a trip later today. I got majorly confused in my relationship yesterday. I have family issues with medical stuff going on. The world is going up in flames, it seems.I just want to sleep though. So much.
Signal	My brain is legitimately preventing me from falling asleep I can feel it, it thinks about all these things to keep me up and all I want to do is sleep my body is tired my eyes are super tired but my brain runs and I can’t I took two melatonin pills nothing worked I tried guided meditation nothing I just took two Advil pm I don’t like the idea of taking these things to make me fall asleep and it’s not even that effective I don’t know what to do. 🥺
NotSignal	2months ago my sleeping issues started... I wasn’t able to fall asleep, like at all, and this seemed weird to me because I never had this problem.It became worse and worse and now I’m still not able to fall asleep AND if I do it feels like I’m awake the whole time. Im so scared i might have fatal insomnia..... please help.
NotSignal	As you struggle through something that you find challenging, you may just wish you could go to sleep and simply wake up wherever you are headed. But even then, if that were even possible, something important would be lost. You may arrive in a calmer state of mind, and it might be easier, but you would have lost the opportunity to learn and experience something that you will one day look back on with great pride. Don’t lament the experience. Embrace it. I’ve been struggling with insomnia for years, and now my family and friends have been coming to me for help. Shittee.. lately I’ve been sleeping like a baby.. maybe it’s because of all my anxieties have come true.. Ima over-thinker and have always been thinking worse case scenarios my whole life.. and now since CoVID-19 people now know how I’ve been feeling my whole goddamn life.. welcome to my nightmare family and friends.. No Sleep, Anixety, Stress, & overwhelmed af
NotSignal	I was finally at a place where I was falling asleep. I think it may have been 2ish. My girlfriend and I had a tense evening. We got into a bit of a scuffle but seemed to resolve it for the most part. We had dinner and watched Netflix. We went to bed and she wanted to connect physically, not necessarily sex, but she just wanted some type of contact. I wasn't really in the mood and started feeling tired. I told her while we were ok for the most part, I was still feeling a little sour from our scuffle earlier. She got upset and started venting. She started pacing around the apartment as I was falling asleep. She's with me every other week and is going home as she's picking up her daughter tomorrow so our time is limited and she wants to ensure we're at a good place before she leaves. Fair. As soon as she decided to calm down and get into bed, of course my body is wide awake. The sleepiness was literally snatched out from under me. I tried to get it back, but I couldn't. I ended up yelling out of frustration and punched the wall. I told her I haven't been able to sleep all week and for the first time throughout the whole week I finally felt sleepy.She went on to tell me that I was able to sleep in this week while she got up to work. I told her we essentially got the same amount of sleep, but mine was in pockets. 3 hours sleep, wake up and stay up for a few hours, back to 3 hours.I'm bipolar and I told her that lack of sleep can cause me to become hypomanic, which she's never witnessed before. If I don't put it in check, it can be really dangerous. Right now I can't sleep and I am in physical pain because of it. I'm so goddamn frustrated. She's still awake next to me, but we're not speaking. I can tell she feels bad. I'm not really looking for advice, I just needed to vent to people that understand. I love her to pieces, but I'm glad she's leaving tomorrow to be with her daughter. I hope I can sleep soon.
Signal	Last time i tried trazodone from what i read looked so promising, but then i got very bad stuffy nose which made my insomnia worse. I tried ambien and it worked like a charm but obviously i cant take it long term....I know i should ask a doctor first but can i be allergic to histamine? Because almost all antidepressants used for insomnia seem to contain it. Thank you
Signal	So, a few nights ago I was laying in bed and normally I can fall asleep in seconds and always feel tired but all night I hadn’t felt tired and had to almost force myself to relax. I took to benadrly the next two nights which made it so much worse so I cut it out all together and started taking melatonin. It’s my second night with it and I cant really notice a difference yet of course. I’ve tried moving around a lot throughout the day and keeping myself busy, even trying to drink a monster so I could crash (didn’t work). I’m really new to this feeling of no sleep so if anyone has advice I’d appreciate it. It sucks so fucking much that I can’t lay down like I used to and get a good nights sleep. When I do get those 2-3 hours of sleep I wake up soon after for no reason and can’t go back to sleep until around 5-6 am.
NotSignal	I’m sure many can relate. What are your techniques to combat it?
Signal	Does anyone go through cycles of insomnia? I’ll sleep perfectly for a while and then all of a sudden I’ll have a week or so with little to no sleep. I’m sure the trigger is anxiety but even after my anxiety is under control I can’t sleep. I’ve tried all natural options and I can’t take any OTC meds or Rx meds as i have a really sensitive body . I’m on night 4 and I’m starting to feel delirious, emotional, nauseated and jumpy. I’ve had about 2-3hours of broken sleep per night. It took me way too long to write and edit this post.
NotSignal	I know you're not supposed to use screens before/during bedtime. But insomnia is so boring and frustrating and sometimes I just want to give up on falling asleep and I want to do something interesting. It's the 3 hour mark that gets me. :(
NotSignal	On work nights, ill wake up every 2-3 hours thinking I’ve missed my alarm and I’m running late for work. I’ll realise after a few moments of checking my phone (and the fact that it’s pitch black outside) that I’m in fact not late. It has happened to me twice in the past where I’ve turned off my alarm and fallen back asleep without realising and been late for work, so I think I’ve been traumatised by these incidents and my brain can’t move past that. Though recently when I do wake up, I’m not necessarily in a panic as much, but my body has gotten so used to waking up every couple of hours that it seems as though it’s become a habit. Has anyone had a similar experience and been able to overcome it?
Signal	Please help me I have not been able to get a good night's sleep in 5 days please I can't go on anymore my body is in pain it feels like I'm gonna die
Signal	just learned about ffi and idk if i have it or not but i think it would make sense. a lot of things line up. i’ve had terrible insomnia constantly building for the last year or so, coupled w/ intense physical fatigue at all times of the day regardless of sleep duration, frequent neck stiffness, random spikes of elevated bp + heart rate typically at night, impotence during sexual encounters, and quickly degenerating memory.thing is, i also have a multitude of mental health issues, specifically mdd, borderline personality disorder, and generalized anxiety, as well as very low testosterone for someone my age (22 male). these symptoms have been steadily building for about a year now, and ik that (statistically) im probably overreacting, and my symptoms may be a result of my diagnoses + medication. however, none of my meds are known for these side effects, and its constantly getting worse.i’ve been awake for newrly 30hours now feeling exhausted but unable to sleep even a wink. laid in bed for 2hrs 45min earlier and nothing. really just wanna know whats good w/ me so if i do have it i can just ease into it and rest for once.does anybody know what types of resources (ie, medical professionals) i should contact for a follow up to my concerns?ps: drugs, even weed, are probably not a solution for me since i am still (technically) a recovering addict
NotSignal	So what I have read and understood from most of the posts that cutting out the negative thoughts can really help in cutting out sleeplessness. Although I have used a few techniques of mine, I’ll keep this in mind as well.
NotSignal	Im so sick of this :( last night I got 3 hours and today 1,5. ciaoIm hoping it gets better cause my eyes hurt and are bloodshoot from the lack of sleep😫😫
Signal	My insomnia is back now that I don’t have to wake up early. Is it time for new sleeping meds? New anxiety medication? Who knows? I don’t.
Signal	I'm going to list a bunch of things and ask is it safe. 150mgs of seroquil, tanzapam 30. Those little yellow sheild with the 10 on it will post name in comment section, melitolan, I'm also on some government manufactured speed at night they use the lab to cook in a pharmicyutical company.Just kidding just those adhd meds.Is all this safe? Also a little cocaine for depreshion its legal in Canada! XD google it?BUT all bullshit aside, cocaine, speed, tanzapam, cyclobenzaprine. Seroquil gabapentin also 150 mg melitolan. I know the benzo mustle relaxants will be calming If not tireding and drunkin like with the gabapentin I have high tolerance to that. One time woken up seeing doubble. But it's still going to play a roll with the others in CNS depression. Well the cocaine, amphetamine combo will keep me awake. If u didn't know a little coke and some speed with a little L-Theanine cut the two amplify but the theanine calms at same time so I feel like it's really more safe then the two together. With all this mix.. I know I won't die. I just want to know, should I do something to counter act the depression before falling asleep. Would u guys recommend taking a lesser dosage of seroquil? Because I already took the other two and the seroquil isn't optional, I have dependance to its not intense without it but I need it not in a Winnie drug addicnway but in a way that I know I'll wake up better feeling then when I went to sleep and the dragon won't be there but the girlfriend will. Just kidding on that but you get the picture. Iv just never taken so many anti-anxolic and I Dont want to stop breathing so should I take a small CNS stimulant before I go to bed?
Signal	17F and a history of depression and anxiety. Idk i just haven’t been able to get a good nights rest since January. Sometimes im out by 3AM sometimes It’s an all-nighter. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore - i’ve been taking melatonin pills (3mg, two tablets) if I hit the 4:300 mark, but it honestly doesn’t do much. The last time i remember actually feeling sleepy before bed was January before this whole pandemic even started, but sometimes i’m not even stressing at all I’m just unable to sleep. Exercise before bed, reading, music, pills, not working on my bed, i’ve tried it all. All useless. It’s 5:30 right now and I can hear the birds and see the sun rise. It’s amazing how I can be so tired and yet not he able to sleep.
NotSignal	For the past two nights now, I have been dealing with insomnia. Last night, I had trouble sleeping because I would exhale loudly through my nose just as I am drifting off. That would cause me to get scared and prevent me from sleeping. It's happening again tonight. I need answers...
NotSignal	I lay down in bed, with the lights on, I face my wall. But I cannot sleep. There's an overwhelming energy, or a force that makes me believe I'm being watched. It's like a magnet, an invisible attraction. I stop thinking about anything and everything, and only about what is watching me.Don't say it. Don't think it. The less I try to think about it, the more I think about it. I lose sleep over it every night. Does anyone else feel this too?
NotSignal	My anxiety keeps me up a lot. My paranoia terrifies me and I find my self full of adrenaline when I should be sleeping. I've had a bad trauma that happened at night and I feel like I should be awake to protect me and my family. It gets worse when I'm in bed with my thoughts and my brain doesn't seem to shut off. I am no stranger to delusions and a lot of nights, I experience auditory hallucinations which put knots in my stomach all night. I'm on edge all of the time and constantly alert. If I somehow do get to sleep, my dreams are vivid and disturbed. It's horrible and I feel exhausted everyday. I'm only 19 and I feel ridiculous taking so much responsibility onto myself, but I feel like I have no other choice.
Signal	So the last three weeks my sleep had gotten even worse. I was down to 2 hours of sleep. I’ve been miserable. Ive been so exhausted, depressed, and sick. I just vomited and laid down around 11p.m. Next thing i know it’s 6:30a.m and i’m late as all out doors for work. lol. I have a love hate relationship with “crashing” because I slept so good, and finally feel better but i know i only feel this way because i’ve been suffering for weeks. I have to suffer to get to the crash..
NotSignal	Hello, as many of you here are complaining of the same, yes the pandemic has screwed with my sleeping schedule completely. However, from that came a brand new issue for me.A little while back I attempted to stay up all night and the following day in order to reset my circadian rhythm, which worked for a short term, but my sleeping schedule went back to complete randomness. As of last week, I started to go to bed and not be able to fall asleep for hours, for the first couple nights I figured that this isn't new to me as I struggle with anxiety sometimes and get bad nights of sleep because of it, and I was having some of it. However, this is starting to get annoying. Even though I went to bed perfectly fine the last couple nights, tonight, I've been lying in bed for almost 4 hours, tired, ready to go to sleep. I just can't. I'm not exactly anxious, except really just annoyed at the fact that I'm probably gonna feel like crap tomorrow, but every time I feel like I'm close to falling asleep, my body suddenly urges me to wake back up, like I have a sudden rush of adrenaline. I've never felt more and more annoyed in my life. :)I wanna take a wild guess and say that because of the quarantine forcing me inside, the lack of going outside and doing shit is messing with my body's ability to tell night from day? I honestly don't know at this point.So I'm really wondering here whether this is something worth getting checked out by a specialist, or if this is some phenomenon I can trick myself into getting over, because this pandemic isn't doing me any justice. Please let me know.Thank you!
NotSignal	Been 6 months since my stomach cancer surgery and I don’t know what sleep is anymore. All I could think of everyday is “will I die from insomnia or cancer reoccurrence?” My life is horrible and I’m only holding in for my 3 year old son.If I could just sleep like a normal sleeper I wouldn’t think about cancer coming back and would live my life to the fullest.
NotSignal	I’m 23F, I don’t want to live anymore. I have had severe anxiety since I was a kid and depression as an effect of this. It’s all genetic, mental illnesses running deeply within my family. The long term physical anxiety has led me to have health issues, including my period stopping for over 2 years and doctors have no answers. I tried birth control which made things worse. And now I am finally off everything. I tried neruofeedback, which helped a little bit but didn’t do much more. I tried keto diets, carnivore diet, multiple psychiatric meds, acupuncture, exercise, cutting out sugar, meditating, goal setting, gratitude journaling, therapy, psilocybin. I mean, pretty much anything that I can try I have. I have severe insomnia which makes my life super difficult to navigate, medication doesn’t work or stops working so please don’t suggest it. Trust me, I have tried to every class of pills. I have an amazing boyfriend and live in a wonderful location at a beautiful school. My life isn’t bad, I like it. But my hormones not working at all and not being able to sleep is killing me. I can’t think or anything else to try to help. It’s been 3 years since I’ve been trying to tackle this issue and nothing works. I often think of killing myself. And I’m not looking for, “you can do it just push through “ comments. Or “your life is worth something” I know it is. I value myself at a very high level. I think I am worthy of living. But with these debilitating health issues. Because I actually have health issues. It’s not I hate my life for no reason. I haven’t gotten a menstrual cycle in 2 years and the doctors I went to couldn’t help. If anyone actually has good suggestions, please let me know. But please do not recommend psychiatric pills or therapy. If you read above, I have tried those for well over 2 years. And CBTI I already tried as well. Looking for new things I can try, not the same things over again.
Signal	I literally can’t sleep without Seroquel. If not Seroquel, I require some other type of sedative. I’m afraid this is a lifetime thing and kinda worried cuz I’ve been dealing with shaky hands for a while. I’ve only been taking a low (25-50mg) dose on and off for 3 years but the side effects seem to be getting a tad worse over time. Maybe I can’t handle it? Idk, nothing else works and I’ve tried a lot with my psychiatrist. Any advice on how to deal with the shakiness or reduce it?
NotSignal	I rarely get insomnia this bad, but I haven’t slept in over 50 hours. What are the chances of walking into an urgent care and telling them this that they give me a benzo to knock me out?
NotSignal	Hey,It's around 3:30 am, wide awake and have no intentions of sleeping. I'm almost 100% sure its anxiety, but I dont have any way of getting rid of it. Something is coming up in less than 2 days and honestly I dont know how to feel about it. Sometimes I believe it's my (at this point) addiction to caffeine/coffee that I'm so awake, bc at round 2 pm usually I drink a "Starbucks Triple Shot Coffee" (which if you dont know has 225 mg of caffeine) which I dont feel anything after I drink it but maybe im immune; i soon realized that's not the case, seeing as i didnt have one today, I had coffee but it was a VERY small amount, less than a cup. Yeah I just wanted to vent, thanks :)
Signal	I don't really like to drug myself to fall asleep more than the minimum on my prescription but I've found the past couple of nights Im so desperate for sleep, I end up taking more around 3 am (and often still end up in twilight instead of sleep). So tonight I took them preemptively and I'm still wide awake. Why can't I win?
Signal	I've been on SSRIs (escitalopram / sertralin) for 7 years. I discontinued them 2 years ago. Ever since I only get a couple of hours of sleep most of the time. I tried various sleep aids, melatonin, magensium, sleep hygene... It does help to fall asleep most of the time (although it doesn't happen till 1-2 am anyway), but I wake up at around 6 am and can't fall asleep afterwards (just get that instant feeling of cortisol in my system and that's it - no way to get asleep). If I don't get at least 7.5 hours of sleep I feel like drunk all day and next night is usually even worse. I sometimes feel like it's just not comfortable in the bed for some reason, and I never able to find a comfortable pose for sleep (I can't sleep on my belly due to disc hernia). I'm sure the problem is lack of seratonin in my system which doesn't convert to melatonin and thus I just have a lack of chemistry that will make me want to sleep. I'm now trying 5HTP, took a capsule yesterday at around 8-9 PM. It didn't help at all.&#x200B;Is getting back to SSRI and being on them for the rest of my life the only option? Any advice please.
Signal	Indica 10mg marijuana gummies. Life changing. And the dreams are bonkers! No drowsiness/hangover. Fall asleep within 1/2 hour. Stay asleep. RSL went away too. Life changing. And the dreams are bonkers! No drowsiness/hangover. Fall asleep within 1/2 hour. Stay asleep. RSL went away too.
Signal	Please if anyone can recommend me sth tha worked for him/her anything ... like every night even days are becoming awaken nightmares._. Am i the only one that insomnia comes with :Stress , anxiety, can’t breath .. ( like when I finally get to sleep I just stop breathing) wake up again ... , and other sh*t!!??
NotSignal	hey im mad at ... i dont know at who or what but wanted to leave something written now that i found this subreddit, i wake up at 6 everyday, today aswell, i dont even take naps so i can sleep early at night, but no, my body/mind doesnt want to fckng shutdown early and here i am, a 2020 zombie walker, cant even smoke weed to go to sleep because ill wake up even more tyred, i would love to be a cat.
NotSignal	The last 3 or 4 nights I have got maybe 5 hours total of sleep, if that! It feels like I sleep for like 30 minutes at a time throughout the night but I’m always unsure if I’m actually sleeping or not because the sleep is incredibly “light” and I have dreams that I remember so easily which is the the only indication that I am actually asleep, but it doesn’t feel like I am! And I sort of just “fade” out of the sleep and go right back into laying there just thinking of things, so that confuses me and makes me think I wasn’t actually sleeping. It’s so frustrating! It happens all night long to the point where I don’t feel like I slept at all. Is this normal with insomnia? Anyone experience this as well? Thanks in advance for any replies!
Signal	Sometimes when I feel really anxious and I can’t sleep I take .5mg of Klonopin and 100mg of trazodone to help me sleep. Is this okay to take together? Or is it dangerous. I couldn’t really find anything on the internet about the interactions between the medications. I have a doctor appointment soon and plan on asking then too, but just wanted to know in the meantime. Thank you!
Signal	I know this pandemic is just causing a ridiculous amount of exaggerated hysteria, but my insomnia is kicking into high gear for the second night in a row while in quarantine and my brain is on fire. I feel like I’m swimming upstream. I’m doing the same shit I always do except I’m not going into work. Im working on projects that might end up meaningless depending on the state of the world/economy after all this is over. I’m working on health goals that won’t matter if I end up sick. Every morning, I think to myself “business as usual,” but it feels weird. All I can do is keep moving forward, trying to be the best person I can be. How ironic it would be if I finally got it all together and have it all be for nothing.
Signal	i’ve only slept for 2 hrs total in the last 2 days and now im extremely tired but i dont want to sleep I FEEL LIKE IM GONNA DIE IF I DID my whole body hurts im in severe pain i dont know why but i dont want to sleep i can liteyatlly feeli tmist it im gonna fucking dievtonight. im about toh ave a panic attack
NotSignal	I just started taking abilify and have noticed I get about 45 minutes of sleep versus the 3 to 4 hours I used to get. Has any one else experienced this?
NotSignal	I only manage to get 2-3 hrs of sleep a day. I’m afraid at some point my eyes are going to be so red that I may develop some kind of eyesight problem.
NotSignal	I’m about to embark on this after reading that histamine reactions can cause insomnia, anxiety and depression. Some foods high in histamine are alcohol, kombucha, soy sauce, aged cheese, processed meats and any leftovers of any kind in the fridge. I’m willing to try anything at this point.
NotSignal	I get these really scary dreams like 3-4 times a week and when I finally get I in comfortable position and fall to rem sleep the dream happens and I forced myself up by forcing myself to shake my head and then I can never fall back to sleep and the next day is destroyed. Does this happen to anyone else?
Signal	I've spoken up in the past about hating trazedone because it gives me wicked migraines and ridiculous dry mouth. HOWEVER...in addition to intractable insomnia, I also have ulcerative colitis that has decided to flare up and rear its ugly head yet again. My drs in the past have prescribed hyoscyamine along with pred but for whatever reason (and infinite wisdom, I'm sure) hyoscyamine is no longer permitted in the U.S. per the FDA. But trazedone has shown potential in also slowing GI peristalsis.&#x200B;SO here's the question: Does anyone have experience with trazedone being a primary insomnia med with the added benefit of slowed GI motility?
Signal	i don’t even know what’s real at this point i’ve done so many drugs and now i’m sick and i just got a taco bell party pack hopefully i’ll get some sleep after i eat some tacos man i don’t even know don’t do coke that shit is the devil but i had insomnia before i did it i’m seeing things and my heads pounding so yea idk jus thad to get this off my chest
Signal	I also have extreme anxieties and it effects my sleep.
NotSignal	I remember coming home after work and my little sister asking if she could stay home with me while our parents went out for a bit and of course I didn’t mind. I went to the bathroom and must’ve fallen asleep for a few minutes because I think I woke up (? I have no idea if I was asleep or just in a weird daydreaming state) and quickly ran downstairs to see if my sister was alright. (She’s 11 and very capable of looking after herself but I still felt guilty)She assured me that I’d only been in the bathroom for about 5 minutes when it really felt like it’d been over an hour but whatever..After that I sat with her for a short while and then I woke up in the bathroom again, this time I was laying in the shower with no pants on. When I found my pants, I realised that I’d peed myself which is embarrassing but I have no recollection of it happening. I have no idea how I got myself to the bathroom or even leaving my sister. I asked her if I’d even come downstairs at all, doubting that the first time was even real but she told me that I did and that I was acting weird and mumbling to myself. She also said that I asked her what time it was a few times in the same minute. I don’t remember. Embarrassing experience but I’m worried about it happening again. I left her alone for too long and I’m ashamed of what happened and idk if this even makes sense. I’m so lost right now. I’ve never had this type of experience before. Like I literally don’t remember anything..
Signal	I have had bad insomnia for as long as I remember. As a child I cried multiple times a week because I was so tired, wanted to sleep but I couldn't. Many years later and it got worse and worse. Many days staying up 50+ hours and sleep for 4 hours and do it all over again.Weed improved it a bit. If I smoked so much I passed out.Unfortunatly I had to quit this habit and sleeping has become a bigger battle.After quitting weed it was really bad for the first few months.But it became better by time. After a while I even was able to sleep everynight for at least 6 hours.This lasted for a few months. Some better than others.Out of nowhere, it is even worse now than before. In 7 days I have slept like 10/12 hours. :(
Signal	I’ve suffered from insomnia since I was young. I can’t remember if it started in middle school or high school. I’ve been taking diphenhydramine started off with 25 mg then taking two pills. I switched to unisom 50 mg. The problem I’ve had with diphenhydramine is my body gets used to it or doesn’t keep me asleep. I’ve tried melatonin through hs and it’s the same thing. Messed up my sleep schedule and wouldn’t keep me asleep. I also had prescribed sleeping pills but they drained me out and made me depressed. I have also tried Sleepy Tea, it doesn’t make me go to sleep all the time. Does anybody have any suggestions? I’ve been looking into valerian root and sleeping pills with melatonin, lavender, valerian root.
NotSignal	I don't want to be awake and I don't want to sleep, and I don't really know why. And it seems my mind is in too much control. That my body and eyes are heavy doesn't seem to matter at all. For once I want to sleep without the aid of chemicals, but without them I'm restless. My brain fires off thoughts and questions that I then try to figure out the answers to. I slowly get more and more angry at myself for wasting precious night hours, making it even harder to sleep. It's stupid.
Signal	I have had sleeping issues and anxiety since high school. I'm now 29 years old. I've also had heavy periods since puberty.I recently had a blood test and my doctor found I have extremely low iron, due to my heavy periods (and possibly endometriosis).I looked into it - there's strong link between iron deficiency, anxiety and insomnia. Insomnia also occurs in iron deficient people without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Deficiencies in magnesium and B6 are also linked.Since making an effort to increase my iron and going on the pill to reduce my bleeding, my sleep and mood have improved a lot. I'm still building my iron stores and I wouldn't say my sleep is perfect, but I can now sleep 7-8 hours without needing sleeping pills. :) I'm not suggesting the cause of everyone's insomnia is due to iron deficiency, but it's helped me, and it's an easy fix. Perhaps it can help others here. Has anyone else had similar experiences when addressing nutritional deficiencies? TL;DR: addressing my iron deficiency helped improve my sleep and anxiety.
Signal	because i am an introvert, my mom doesn't think i have insomnia, and its just because i "don't go outside". my sleep schedule is around 7-8am to 12-1pm (homeschooled). this has been going on for months now, starting with 2am to 12pm, slowly getting less and less sleep. one day i spent 6 hours working outside, and still had sleep problems. i try my best to stay off of electronics right before bed, i usually spend an hour or two doing nothing but staring at a pillow. melatonin doesn't work anymore, and i dont drink anything with caffeine. i had to vent, because i have nobody else to vent with. maybe my insomnia has something to do with my depression, or suicidal thoughts?
NotSignal	As the title says I just found Out I have insomnia it explains a lot actually
NotSignal	I have CPTSD and relational trauma from childhood. Now an adult when I go through bad breakups or relationships I get really bad stress/anxiety. I see a therapist for IFS but curious how to fix insomnia as I think my inflammation and anxiety would be gone if I could sleep. What’s worked best?1. Meds2. CBTI3. sleep restriction4. Combo?Help I’m dying
Signal	I had a really bad bout of insomnia last night. I woke up at 3:00, took 2.5mg of melatonin and fell back asleep at around 6:00. I woke up at 10:30, but I feel like absolutely shit right now.What are some things that actually help you fall asleep? I usually have no problem actually falling asleep (I have a weighted blanket and I wear a sleep mask and earplugs), but rather STAY asleep.
NotSignal	I’ve (20f) always taken at least a could hours to fall asleep as long as I can remember. When I was kid I would be getting up at 6 in the morning to go to school, be told to go to bed at 9 but unable to fall asleep until midnight to 2am. This lasted pretty much all of my life, and I’m reading this subreddit and realizing it might not be normal. I’ve had issues recently where I will be dead tired and won’t be able to fall asleep for up to 3-4 hours where I’ll be staring at the ceiling. On average I take about two and a half hours to fall asleep every night. I’ve also seen that some people have sleep disorders that cause them to fall asleep naturally at 6pm and then not be able to sleep the rest of the night, and I it blew me away because I thought that that was also a normal thing. I’m kind of in between though because my parents have never seen this as like... an issue? They’re the type of people who can fall asleep in less than 20 minutes or straight away, and I always just thought that that was lucky. Now I’m looking it up and that’s the AVERAGE TIME? I’m honestly so confused. It doesn’t seem as severe as a lot of people who can’t ever sleep, so I’m torn about it. What do you guys think? Is this really an issue? I’ve kind of just dealt with it. Really it’s mainly just blowing my mind that most people can fall asleep quickly..... like how did I go 20 years of my life not knowing that haha.
Signal	I had suffered from bad insomnia a few years ago (stress and negative sleep conditioning/anxiety related). Usually can’t sleep for multiple days at a time. Most I got up to was seven which was awful. I mostly have been able to keep it under control taking the occasional ambien but have had a bit of a relapse given the pandemic and the break from normal routine. I’m lucky if I get a broken hour or two of sleep a night and I’m getting desperate. Any recommendations for a good sleep medicine specialist in DC? Preferably one that has an in house CBT therapist. Thanks in advance!
Signal	I've been taking 5HTP and Tryptophan 1000mg for a couple of days. No effect from what i can see so far. I also have been taking 1mg of Melatonin for close to 3 months now. I currently suffer from sleep fragmentation. I wake up around 1 AM if I go to sleep at 11:30 let's say. Then i would wake up around 4-5 AM then at 7-8 AM.I just can't get a good deep sleep. Another thing is that i have IBS, which is known to cause some insomnia due to bathroom habits or pain. I have both under control so I'm not sure what's keeping me awake. Sleep can make IBS worse and in turn worse IBS can make sleep even worse so I'm looking for ways to improve sleep quality.I also have this random minor palpitation/spasm type of feeling on my body every few min on my body. Not sure if that's worth mentioning.Sorry for the rant.....Anyone know if Tryptophan and 5HTP worked for them? Thanks.
Signal	I recently started changing my sleeping habits about 1 week ago. **I stopped smoking pot and changed my bedtime from 4-5 AM to 2 AM.** This sounded a whole lot better than getting about 5-5.5 hours of interrupted sleep. Only on the second night did I start having issues with this new regimen. I hopped in bed at 2 AM, woke up at 4 AM, and stayed up for a couple more hours til I decided to start my day. Then the next day, I was able to fall asleep at around 3, wake up at 8, and fall back asleep until my body woke me up around 11. I felt refreshed. Now I can't keep track of exactly how many days this has been going on, but it's seriously taking control of how I operate. One day I feel like shit. The next I feel great because my sleep is semi-normal. **One big stressor is how I think about how my life is affected from not having sleep and then I have anxiety while I lay in my bed.** Breathing techniques and overall exhaustion luckily knocks me out cold in about 30-45 minutes.&#x200B;*Benadryl seems to do nothing for me and neither does melatonin.***Some things to note:*** **Caffeine never affected my sleep this badly in the past.*** **Electronics don't seem to be the culprit since I never had less than 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep no matter what.*** **My diet is relatively clean - enough protein for the gym and enough nutrients to feel good.*** **I assume I'm biphasic - I've always woken up in the middle of the night to pee.*** **I wake up and pee every single time - even if it's 10 seconds of pissing.*** **Dreaming is completely vivid and I have them almost every night now.*** **I was thinking of hopping on trazodone since I know that's commonly used for treating insomnia.**
NotSignal	So this is my first r post and it's really late right now and my brain doesn't seem to want to shut off and sleep so I was wondering if I could just...Talk. I was never really sure how to start one of these things but I thought, "Hey, let's talk about why you can't sleep." Theories and conspiracies take up my headspace where silence should be and why are things just so...Relatable. You know? Like that theory of when you come close to death or die, the universe splits and one alternate universe you are alive and one you are dead. Its just... For example, a few years ago, I was in the car with my ex (we were together at the time) and they were in a bad mood and traffic did not help. They were in the drivers seat and I was in the passenger and.. I think we were arguing about something, and they hit the gas to turn into a parking lot and another car hit us T style. My head hit the door by the seatbelt and my ears rang and it was mostly a blur. I died then, but in another alternative reality. But did I really? Conspiracy theories are conspiracy theories in themselves.
NotSignal	I haven't been able to sleep much for the past week. Is started this Monday. I try to fall asleep but as soon as im about to my brain kicks me back up and im wide awake again. I get stuck in this endless cycle for hours until my bodys exhaustion beats my brain. This happened again on Tuesday. Not on Wednesday or Thursday. But now it's Friday and it happened again. Can someone give me any information on if anything is happening to me?
Signal	I just got woken up with the most irrational anxiety... took a midnight nap I guess because I cannot get to sleep... might just got for a run and see what happens cause this some ole bs. In need of a hug too afraid to ask and get a no
NotSignal	Been struggling with the awful racing thoughts before falling asleep again. I was doing really well for a while, if I had any racing thoughts they were more positive or exciting thoughts and easier to manage. Now my anxious mind has returned but of course it’s here before I try to sleep! It’s annoying that these thoughts have to come in at night rather than during the day, guess I have things to address lol. It sucks to be scared to even try to sleep when you’re actually tired because you don’t want to meet those thoughts. It’s like trying to leap over a giant pit. This is really just me ranting my frustrations so thanks if you read :)
Signal	I am 18(f) and this last year for me has been of restless sleep. I do not have a problem falling asleep at night, but I have a problem of staying asleep. It seems I wake up every hour of the night for no reason. I have always been a light sleeper, but this is more than that. I am considering looking into taking melatonin supplements, but I don’t know if this is the best option or where to even start with that. Any advice would greatly help!! I am so tired.
NotSignal	I have extreme hypnic jerks , shocks after shocks ,jolts muscle contractions , as if a fucking dynamite explodes in my head , feeling that my heart stands still and breathing .. some times i smoke some hasjies , very little i think it worsens the jerks so bad . Any one have an idea ?
Signal	I took my sleep meds at 1233am. I got drowsy.Did not sleep.It’s 1241am now.I want sleep.Please give it to me.
Signal	I don’t know if I have insomnia or not but I’ve always had trouble sleeping since middle school. Every method I ended up using (melatonin, various sleep aids, etc) only worked for a while before my body got used to it and it lost its effectiveness. Recently I’ve been using marijuana at night to knock me out but I had to stop because my tolerance was so high it wasn’t doing anything anymore. I also have chronic back and neck pain that makes it that much harder to fall asleep. The past 2 weeks have been unbearable, I can’t fall asleep until the wee hours and even then i never stay asleep and always end up waking up every other hour. The problem is I’m so unbelievably exhausted but my brain will just not let me go to sleep. Last night was the worst of them, I tried for hours to fall asleep and ended up just laying there in pure exhausted agony, and ended up sobbing on and off for the whole night because I was so tired and just wanted to sleep but couldn’t. I can’t take any heavy duty sleep aids (or just any sleep aid for that matter) anymore because they make me feel so groggy and awful the next morning that it sends me into a bad depressive episode. I feel so powerless and helpless, like I have no control over my own body. I don’t know what to do at this point, I’m so exhausted I’m tempted to just take a sleep aid tonight and deal with the depressive episode. I feel like I’m totally out of options and I just have to suffer. I don’t know what to do.
Signal	so after weeks of going thru crazy insomnia going to sleep around 4-6am i finally found a fix. 3mg of melatonin and benadryl taken toghther will def put you to sleep. make sure you take it 1 1/2 before desired bed time. just to make a mention of it it will not give you quality sleep but will def put you to sleep.
NotSignal	i can’t sleep during the night, i’m either not tired or when i am tired i get super sweaty and then annoyed by that and i’m not tired anymore. i can only sleep after i’m completely exhausted, and only up to 2 hours at a time. i used to be a very heavy sleeper, and now i’m a very light one. it’s affecting my work, and i’m a young healthy male. one example of this is not going to sleep for 1-2 nights, then getting 2 hours of sleep one night, and not being able to sleep for at least another 12 hours
Signal	I did these supplement I have had insomnia for over 4 months . Sorta finally sleeping 6/7 hours . This is the only thing that worked for me I need to share it Magnesium citrate Mugwort Yogi brand - stress down teaGotu kola Lemon balmSometimes add melatonin 10mg This recipe has been able to make me sleep
NotSignal	I’ve had a bad sleep schedule for my whole life, but now I like actually can’t sleep.I woke up at 6 pm today. I’m used to forcing myself asleep when the sun comes out and waking up at 2 pm. I actually need to fix this.
NotSignal	I cannot sleep to save my life right now. I can’t seem to relax in my own home.
Signal	Every night I go to bed around 3 am. I can’t stop. I don’t get tired but I force myself to go to sleep but only have light sleep and vivid dreams. I sleep in until 12 or 1pm in the afternoon waking up exhausted. I can’t seem to get out of this terrible sleep cycle. I am getting 9 hours of sleep every night but I still feel so tired. I don’t really do anything during the day because of quarantine and I’m not stressed about anything. Am I depressed or is it a health concern? Also how do I fix it? 🤔
NotSignal	Hey I haven't had good sleep in the past month, the past few days in getting back on track with 4-5 hours of sleep, luckily.Since this happened I ve had issues with my balance while walking sometimes and it's really annoying, is it because of the lack of sleep, and will it go away over time?
Signal	So I've been on Temazepam (20-40mg nightly) since I was 18/19 (28/29 now) and around last year I decided too give up Temazepam after I gave up pregabalin (900mg daily) and diazepam (15mg daily) the year before.At first my insomnia was horrible but falling asleep became easier and easier, though I never felt like I slept, like ever. Always waking up several times throughout the night and even if I never recalled waking up throughout the night, I never felt like I got any sleep. I am using 2 grams of sensoril ashwagandha, 3 grams of L theanine and I have a protein shake consisting of ether bone broth or marine colegen (or both) and I no longer feel like I dont get sleep, but falling asleep when I need too sleep and wake up at a certain time is very difficult so I am trying too figure out a knock out combo with no withdrawl effects, tolerance, negative side effects.I just started using Kratom and after a few weeks I now feel withdrawal effects at night, which is what I wanted too avoid, so scrapping the kratom idea.Ive used passion flower but it never really done much, I am a male and avoid anything that can affect my testosterone so I avoid camomile and valarian root and lemon balm for the thyroid issue it causes.Next I plan on maybe trying a mix of magnolia bark, blue skull cap and passion flower, but ultimately I feel like I am just drawing at straws, knowing they are all the short straw and nothing is going too work as well as Temazepam ever did.. I've tried the Gaba B3 combo molecule, I am unsure if it worked well or not.Melatonin powder is something I plan on buying from ebay and hoping the addition is useful.I need too find a CBD isolate though if only I could use low dose THC with high dose CBD (1mg/10mg) but UK so we don't have access too anything like that currently.Anyone in the same boat or gotten off the boat? Id love if something like gaboxadol was available, or a hypnotic with less issues than our current solutions.Id love a hypnotic plant.
Signal	I really haven’t slept for more than 2-3 hours in months. I am so fatigued during the day, I can’t socialize normally with my roommates or friends. I just want to be alone at all times. I’ll feel okay around 7pm - 11pm energy wise, but can’t sleep. 4am hits and I get anxious. 5am hits and I just get sad. The sleep aids I’m using don’t work. They’re called Sleep 3 and have melatonin in them. I need help!
NotSignal	Think of your mind as a phone When fully charged(awake) it can perform its task normally during the day but as the battery goes down(like someone getting tired) it starts to get slow and harder to use. someone without Insomnia can turn the phone off when they want to. people with insomnia that off button doesn’t work you only turn off when the battery fully dies (you pass out from lack of sleep (please make a better Analogy if you want)
Signal	You get a lot of blood draws when you're pregnant, and I (being the obsessive person I am) like googling every single number on the tests to find out what it means. I don't know if these numbers will remain the same once giving birth, but I still feel like I've gotten some useful info that I'd like to share.My white blood cells are elevated, and my red blood cells are low. A few other numbers related to these are also correspondingly low or high. None of this concerns my doctor as the levels crucial to pregnancy are normal and these few areas are close enough to not warrant any major red flags, but after googling, I feel like I'm a few steps closer to knowing my body and why I've struggled with sleep for so long.Apparently the numbers I'm seeing can show up as a result of B12, iron, folate and vitamin D deficiency. I'm pretty sure I remember a routine blood test from a standard physical a year or so ago that showed similar results and my doctor suggested taking these vitamins as supplements. A deficiency in these areas can cause fatigue and insomnia, apparently. Of course, it's hard to tell if that's the case, because stress and insomnia can also cause deficiencies in these nutrients (what comes first, chicken or egg?).Anyway, I'm motivated to start taking vitamins and eating more dark green foods, and I hope that will help me. It might help you all too if you give it a try.
NotSignal	Rolling onto my 4th consecutive day now, and the hallucinations, both auditory and visual are starting to become even more and more intense and cause of my age the doctors are STILL reluctant as hell to give me any medication, just wondering if anyone had any advice on how best to cope with them until i eventually do manage to get to sleep. Atm the worst of them are the auditory, so im blasting ym music through my headphones, but even thats starting to seem futile.
Signal	Some days I can sleep 6/7 hours/night (fragmented sleep though) and there’s other nights where I struggle to get 3 hours of sleep (also very fragmented). The past few days i’ve been getting less and less sleep, (got 2h30 total last night) after a week of getting a decent amount of sleep. It bothers me that I don’t have a pattern. I never know what tonight is going to bring me. I try to just let it be and not be too anxious about it so maybe it passes, but it always takes a week or a little bit more before I go back to a decent sleep duration...
NotSignal	For the first time in a month I'm sleeping. Real genuine sleep. Unfortunately it's happening at 3am until 12pm. I'm finally getting interview offers but I need to be awake for the actual interviews. How can I change this without going back to losing all of my sleep? Any ideas?
Signal	I’m going through a lot right now I’m trembling and shaking at the moment I been in and out the hospital I havid covid 19 and I was already suffering anxiety and depression and it has got worse I’m afraid to sleep no sleep meds is helping me I’m so terrified and exhausted from not sleeping ever time I take some to calm me down it makes me even more anxious I’m wondering am I alone and what do y’all suggest
Signal	He’s usually stressed, but normally he gets 5-7 hours of sleep daily. However, his father (my grandfather) passed away two weeks ago and he’s beyond stressed now having to deal with my grandparents finances/bank/their money, and he told me thats all he can think about, his mind is racing constantly and doesn’t quiet down. He was prescribed Valium and it is not working for him. I’m genuinely concerned for him. He hasn’t slept not even 30 minutes in a few days. Does anyone have any recommendation ?
NotSignal	After 8 months of battling this shit I am finally ready to say I got over it! If you want any suggestions PM me or ask here.
Signal	New to this thread so hello my fellow insomniacs. Going on night #3 in a row of not being able to sleep and I just wanna cry. I was soooo freaking tired all day today that I couldn’t even function. I was in a daze all day today because I was so tired from only getting 2 hours of sleep the past couple of nights. I was shaking all day I was so tired and felt absolutely sick to my stomach. I tried to take a nap around 6 pm and couldn’t fall asleep. So now here I am, having took Zzquil, after have been trying to fall asleep for 3 hours and still can’t sleep. It’s like the second I “try” to fall asleep my body knows. I know I have anxiety (I take Lexapro)... but the problem is I don’t feel anxious ever unless I’m trying to fall asleep. My heart will pound, my breathing will become rapid. This happens to me so much now-a-day’s. I have started going from my bed, to the couch, back to my bed, and sometimes even resort to falling asleep on the floor. I use a white noise machine which helps some but not a ton. I have black out blinds. I try to workout regularly and not have caffeine past a certain point in the day so as to not affect my sleep. Have tried melatonin in the past to no avail. Nothing works. I know I could get on a sleep medication, but I’m a doctor and just know too much about the stuff and really don’t want to become dependent on a medication to sleep. I’m mostly just hear to complain that insomnia is a real bitch and I wish there was an easier fix for this. On a side note - I never had sleep problems until a few years ago when I started medical school. I think the constant anxiety over tests and assignments and constantly needing to give 100% did a number on me. I would sometimes go a week or 2 in med school without getting more than an hour or 2 of sleep a night. I don’t know how I passed my classes cause I was so exhausted 99% of the time. I think my body has continued to stay in this state even though I’ve graduated.
Signal	short and sweet: I had been sleeping very well on a decent schedule for the last two weeks. I was going to be anywhere from 10 pm to 3 am and sleeping until about 9 am to 1 pm. aside from a little of the usual depression, I was feeling fantastic. was productive and in high spirits most days after I convinced myself to get out of bed. it was the most relieving two weeks I've had in a while ...then I had an extra cup of coffee to make it through my research paper today. now it's 5am and sleep is no where to be seen. for once I did this to myself. let this be a lesson to every other self induced insomniac on this sub 😂🤷‍♂️
Signal	i heard about it from here, does’t really helped u with anxiety and insomnia? or i will waste my money?
NotSignal	12:11 - pee, go to bed.1:11 - gotta pee.1:45 - gotta pee.Like half an hour, I think: sleeeeep.2:53 - gotta pee, also shit.3:38 - gotta pee.4:40 - gotta pee.5:53 - gotta pee, also sun.6:02 - staring at ceiling, surely there are no more fluids left.Like, an hour or so: sleeeeep.8:21 - wake up nine minutes early, gotta pee.
NotSignal	Do you guys sometimes experience this at least 3-4x a night? Just a second before you were finally to fall asleep then this happens then you have to try to fall asleep again
NotSignal	I don't feel like I have insomnia because I feel like I could sleep if i absolutely needed to, but I just don't feel the urge to and much rather stay up and skip sleep that night. Sometimes i do this 2-3 nights in a row until i finally get tired enough that i naturally nod out. As anyone else have this problem and what can I do to fix it? Or should i even worry about it?
NotSignal	Fell asleep around 9....woke up at midnight, haven't fallen back asleep. I'm up now to drink some hot tea, maybe that'll help idk. If not maybe if I'm up all night, I'll sleep tomorrow?
Signal	Hi:Ive been an insomniac for 2 years now and ive previously tried trazadone, seroquel, and zopilcone for sleep, and non of these have worked. im trying to search for other options to bring up to my GP so if you know of any meds that have worked for you, please reply with their names.thanks!
Signal	for the past few weeks ( probably almost a month now ) i havent been able to sleep with out taking multiple meds. i was perscribed by my doctor to take 25mg of something ( i dont really remember what its called since im writing at 5 am ) and i only take it when i need it. the problem there is that it doesnt make me sleeply it just helps keep me asleep. when i take the pill i can sleep anywhere from 8-12 hours, so i've stopped taking it since it has done nothing to help. ive also tired meditating and taking 6 mg of melatonin and both have done nothing to help. after i started taking the pill my doctor gave me i've been feeling very dizzy and light headed anytime i stand up ( its not from not enough water or food ). my problem is that i either sleep the whole day or i stay up until i can see the sun and hear the birds chirping. im so tired yet im unable to sleep. is this insomnia or a different problem? ( this is my first post here so lmk if there is a better place to go )
Signal	I feel like nothing will help my insomnia. Over the past few months, I have tried and failed trazadone and gabapentin for sleep. I am now on doxepin and no luck with this either so far. My doctor is concerned about putting me on a controlled substance, as my mother is an addict who is currently in rehab for alcoholism. No matter what I take, I still lie awake for hours and end up getting 2-3 hours of sleep per night and then being a complete unproductive zombie all day at work. This is so miserable and so frustrating. (I also practice all recommended sleep hygiene and go to therapy)
NotSignal	What is the difference between someone with chronic insomnia that can return back to natural sleep with CBT-i or sleep restriction compared to someone who has chronic insomnia and nothing works, this is really scaring me that I could turn into a chronic insomniac were nothing works, is there something off in the brain? Is one insomnia and anxiety disorder and the other an actual chemical imbalance? I don’t even have insomnia I have OCD and am currently stressing about thisPlease answer
NotSignal	I’m so depressed at this point. I don’t sleep anymore I can’t think straight. I feel like my mind isn’t mine anymore. I don’t know what else to do
NotSignal	I’m feeling super loopy and not sure if this is even a thing! I’ve tried sleeping or resting my body and mind with meditation. However it just didn’t seem like is enough. I don’t really want medication but I’m afraid this might be too much. Do I go to the ER??? I’m not sure what’s real or not?
Signal	I've been taking clonidine and melatonin for a while and hasn't helped. I want to try CBD, but I don't know if it is okay to mention to my doctor. I want to try the bud form because I used to smoke normal weed and it would be very helpful. My goal now is to be able to sleep on a safe and legal drug like CBD. I don't know how to mention it to my doctor. Any help is welcome, whether insomniac teen or not. Thanks!
Signal	I’ve hardly ever had any trouble sleeping before tonight. I’ve had around 3 maybe 4 hours of sleep tonight but that’s not good since I’ve been up 2 almost 3 days now. I’m scared that every day it might get harder to sleep. I just wanna have a long sleep but I just can’t. Melatonin makes me tired but after I sleep I just wake up after 3 hours or so. This is really worrying me. Sorry for venting again I’m just really scared that I can’t sleep.
Signal	I’m in my mid 20’s and a few years into being a software developer. I only just realised how much my insomnia shaped my career choices. I’ve always thought my dream job was freelancer who could work whenever they want to, wake up whenever they want to. I’d shun working for a company and made up so many excuses of why it wasn’t for me. Now I’m realising that I want to just be able to work a normal working day like everyone else and I was just doing mental olímpics to enable my insomnia.
NotSignal	I been hearing fluffy stuff like CBT-I has more than an 80% of working with long effects. Then you also have meditation which could be time consuming. I already work out and eat well.&#x200B;Any experiences? Thoughts? Things I should be aware of?If it works so well then why do so many people have insomnia still?
NotSignal	Hi. I've been struggling with getting more than 3-5 hours of sleep for a long, long time now. I'm 19 years old, and my sleep problems have been going on since I was about 13. I have always avoided sleep medication in any form due to horror stories of dependence and addiction from people. I once tried benadryl (I was allergic that night), and it knocked me the fuck out. However, I felt absolutely awful upon waking up (drowsy for hours). My sleep problems are singlehandedly the biggest source of stress for me right now, and they impede on every aspect of my life. I'm sure many of you can relate.I came here to ask this: is there a safe sleep medication that I can try that has a low level of dependence? I understand that not all drugs work the same for all people, but id greatly appreciate your help. I'm happy to discover this community. It's nice to find people that suffer similar issues. Thanks for hour help!
NotSignal	I don‘t know why, but I‘m a little afraid of falling asleep.It keeps my awake for long times and I‘m struggling with falling asleep itself.Does someone know a way to get that out of my life?
Signal	I've reached my limit.It's almost 5:30 am and I'm watching the sun lighten the sky for the fourth morning in a row. I took some nyquil and even it had no effect. I've been trying to read for an hour before bed, I've been leaving the bed so I don't associate it with restlessness, I've been working out and working myself to the bone in any hopes of exhausting myself to sleep and NOTHING.It's been one thing to do this during quarentine, but I start a new job next Friday and I can't just crash whenever my body and brain finally say "okay".I don't know where to start. Do I go to a therapist or a GP? I don't have either here, yet. We only moved to town a little bit ago.Could I go to the local clinic and start there? I am just so tight and irritable and tired, and I don't think I can handle going to the wrong kind of doctor. I don't think my anxiety can handle the thought of "wasting someone's time" with my insomnia when they could be talking to someone who need it more, so I want to make sure I'm going to the right place.SOS, where did you guys start when seeking professional help?Many thanks and best wishes.
Signal	So no one really talks to me which is why I’m rather annoyed that I can never sleep in fear that I’ll miss something important from someone, like it’s 2 am no one is sending sos messages to me at 2, in fact no one is sending any messages to me at 2.
NotSignal	I slept 4 hours last night and dont think I’m getting any sleep this night. This thought is kind of making me panic... I know all the health defects that come with sleep deprivation and how it speeds up the age dementia hits- also have adhd, already have enough trouble remembering things, anyone out there?
NotSignal	I still stand by the thought that feeling sleeping but being unable to drift to sleep is worse than not feeling sleepy at all. You’re eyes keep closing but your brain won’t.
NotSignal	I have been struggling with nasal congestion, reduced lung capacity and sinus infection for many years now. I was always tired and foggy when I wakeup.The lockdown due to covid-19 has eliminated air pollution in my neighbourhood and it has drastically curtailed my ailments and improved my sleep quality. I am hazarding a guess here that I am adversely senstive to diesel emissions. Now that lockdown is coming to an end, I am worried that my ailments will revert back. Air pollution is prevailing everywhere across the globe. As a matter of fact, I lived in many cities across India, but I never felt this better. How can I get away from it to have a decent quality of life?
Signal	So over the last couple of weeks my sleeping experience has gone like this:* Go to bed between 1-1:30 AM.* Sleep until roughly 5-7 AM, at which point I will wake up to use the bathroom.* After using the bathroom I return to bed, and am generally able to get back to sleep very quickly.* However, after returning to bed, I will then proceed to wake up at least a dozen times between then and whenever I get out of bed for good, usually around 11 AM.I only wake up for a few seconds, and go right back to sleep after waking up, but again, it happens a dozen times between the time I go to the bathroom and the time I "wake up" for real, and it usually feels like more. I'd make an attempt to log how many times this happens, but usually I'm only barely aware of it. I maintain "dream continuity" during this time, in that any dream I'm having when I wake up will continue where it left off once I fall back asleep; I'm not sure if that means anything. I know for sure that I am waking up, and that these interruptions are not part of any dream I may be having.I'm really at a loss as to what to do about this. I have sent an email to my psychiatrist (currently I'm without a PCP as my former one recently relocated) to see if he has any ideas, but I figured asking here too couldn't hurt. As far as meds go, I am currently taking 40mg of Vyvanse in the morning, and 100mg Trazodone/7.5mg Mirtazapine at night, along with usually 10mg melatonin, though I have tried taking 5mg, 2.5mg, and no melatonin at all with the same results. I've been having issues with sleep for some time now, but things got really problematic around this time last year, when I woke up randomly at 6AM and was unable to get back to sleep -- I then spent the next week and a half unable to get more than 3 hours of sleep at night, which only got better once I started taking Trazodone. I'm still unable to sleep without taking medication. Any advice or info about this is greatly appreciated, at the moment I'm looking for work so I can afford to have a few days where I'm just an exhausted lump, but (hopefully) soon I'm going to need to start sleeping better.
NotSignal	I had a strong coffee at 11 a.m. yesterday, and it stopped me sleeping until about 2.30 a.m. / 3.00 a.m. last night. I mean, its \*one\* coffee!!! Why can't I just be normal!!!
Signal	I had another night of only getting 2 hours of sleep. I got up to use the bathroom and my face looks grey and starting to get red splotches of broken blood vessels as well as covered in pimples. I am so tired and now my self esteem has taken another big hit. I wish I could sleep normally
NotSignal	who would lay awake with your pillow over your head trying to shut out the sounds of all the other kids snoring for God knows how long? I also remember frequently spending the night at one of my friend's houses when I was a kid and the ticking clock that would just keep me up..."Tick...tick...tick.." Once I heard it, I tried so hard to un-hear it but I always dreaded when I would hear that damn clock because I knew it meant sleeplessness.
NotSignal	This whole quarantine shit really messed me up. For the first couple months I went to bed at 2 am and was out by 3. But a couple nights of MW caused me to stay up till 5 and that’s what clapped my cheeks, it stared hell. From then I would not knock out till 6 even though I was in bed by 2. This was so frustrating because laying in bed for hours for a week straight kills you mentally. I nearly snapped when one night I stayed up till 9 am (in bed since 11 pm). I had to hit up my doc and cop some sleep pills, this was my last plan I was afraid to get addicted,I tried everything in one night I took 4 melatonin gummies 2 sleeping pills and 1 sleep tea and it made no difference... Did I mention I was smoking enough weed too put a elephant in a coma? If not then now I did lol anyways the night before I had to pick up the pills I said fuck it let me try anything, I just went on yt and searched “sleep music” and tapped the 3 hour one. This was the best thing I’ve ever done. It’s damn near a psychedelic experience every night, especially when you are faded. It put you in a trance to the point where you are just living through the music and before you know it you are out all night. Through that time I also would wake up every hour and it took like another to fall back asleep and that was fixed. The only thing it really didn’t fix is my whole sleep perception thing (I don’t know if I slept sometimes, I’ll b chilling for a lil and I look at the time and like 5 hours passed and I legit don’t know if I slept) but it’s what ever definitely try this out but listen to a 3 hour one so it stops playing and your phone don’t explode.
NotSignal	I've never suffered before but the last few days I have had severe insomnia. It got to the point today where I fell asleep in the middle of a (text/messaging) conversation and not a boring one either! It's almost like there is something in my brain which when I hit the bed acts like an alarm clock and wakes me up completely.Any ideas?
NotSignal	i get the feeling this is gonna be a nightly thing for a while so we're gonna have a little story time :)sorry this doesn't really have to do with insomnia and I can move it if needed, new to reddit so Im not sure how strict y'all aresorry for any spelling mistakesso I had a teacher last semester we'll call her Dra bc she had a huge ego and insisted we called her Doctora [Insert Surname]. According to her she was one of only two people with a doctorate in the building and took great pride in that. Also this class was 8th period Spanish.Anyway, there where multiple incidents in her class and I'll write them as I remember em so they won't be in order, sorry for jumping around.There was this one girl, we'll call her Mike bc idkSo Mike came back to school late, this was the second week of school and she showed up, sat down behind me, and waited for Dra to pass out work. Once Dra was done with instructions Mike walked up to her desk and politely asked for any work she had missed. Dra refused to give it to her, telling her "to come in tomorrow morning for work", which is a vaild response I will admit. It's still a bit snobby but oh well. I don't remember exactly what happened cuz me and my friend where talking about the work she had handed out. (Side note: later in the year she gave us a packet of 347 questions and told us to finish it during class). All of a sudden in the back of the class we hear mMike start raising her voice:Mike: I'm asking right now if you can please give me the work, I was out because I had brochitis and my sister had complecations with cancer.Dra: And I'm asking that you please work on the class work you have today and come tomorrow morning to get the work.Mike:(raising her voice again)I don't understand it, I need the work from the past week to be able to understand what is required of me!It went back and forth like this for a bit til Dra nearly shouted: Go back to your desk! I will talk to you when you can calm down and have an adult conversation!At some point during this exchange Dra had grabbed Mike's wrist and no one knew til Mike told us later.Later that week Mike asked Dra about a missing grade that she had turned in, Dra started getting upset and saying "well I don't have it so you didn't turn it in!" later that class Dra walked up to Mike's desk with a large stack of papers and slammed it on Mike's desk making everyone jump and turn around to hear Dra say "Here, this is all the work that's been turned in since school started. You can check through this and find your work." then she went back to her desk and ignored all of us staring at her and whispering.She also got upset with the special ed kid in my class. I'm friends with his sister and I know his family so I knew this kid. And he's a really smart kid, don't get me wrong. He just stutters and forget things but he can tell great stories on scout campouts! I digress, no really interesting stories about them, she just got visibly annoyed whenever he asked a question, even if it was a valid question.We never really learned anything in her class she'd just tell us as vaugue as she could what we needed to do then hand out one of her 150 question packets and stare at her computer for the rest of class.TL;DR I had a crappy spanish teacher that got fired for stealing supplies :)
NotSignal	I have no magic wand to cure my insomnia for good, but I kind of wanted to share with y’all what has worked for me a little bit. My insomnia is completely psychological and I don’t want to use any sleeping pills, so this will not be helpful to everyone. My insomnia has been going crazy in the last 2-3 weeks. It used to be once a month sleepless night here and there but now it’s the norm. I’m not working right now and my living situation is very difficult and complex and it creates a lot of mental weight on me. I’m not happy how I have to live right now, but me and my husband are saving to get our own place eventually.. The groundhog’s day life is definitely amplifying all this. Every day is the same. With same limitations with same weather. With same toxic people. I feel mentally numb. My insomnia manifests with not being able to fall asleep, busy mind, body shakes you awake when you start drifting off to sleep etc. It got a bit more of that ‘waking up in the middle of the night and not able to fall back asleep’ spice too. What I started to do; -meditate every day. Did it help? Not really, at least not considerably. I still continue to do it because my ‘wake up’ life is more balanced thanks to that. -writing down my worries during the day and solutions next to each worry. Did it help? Yes, quite a lot. I call this the ‘worry time’. -I told my husband to sleep upstairs. Not happy about this at all, but he falls asleep in seconds which caused me more anxiety. My brain went wild : “ why can’t I fall asleep that fast? What’s wrong with me?” It helped a lot to be honest. -waking up at 6-6.30 am no matter what. It kept me in constant sleep deprivation because I usually fall asleep around 11-1am and that’s just not enough sleep for me. Regardless sleep was much less it started to become much better quality and I did not wake up during the night. Unfortunately I got another sleepless night few nights ago and I had to ‘catch’ up, I took the alarm off for 2 nights. Next night I’ll go back to waking up at 6am. -watching tv in bed. Yes, it’s wrong and horrible and against all the rules. But it empties my mind, and I usually let it run until my eyelids close. Then I drift off to sleep pretty fast.-I stopped panicking about exercise and diet. I took the mentality of being ‘relaxed’. I do not need to run 10 miles a day. I can exercise 20min at home. I can have healthier relationship to food. Not obsessing about intermittent fasting anymore. A huge difference in my mind. -the end goal in mind. This is not forever, reminding myself this too shall pass. The quarantine, insomnia, sleeping without my husband. Everything will get back to normal. Life goes in cycles. Take care, everyone. We can get through this. This reddit is such a great place for support
Signal	Not sure if this is bothering anyone else, but suddenly not having any stores that are open 24 hours is extremely hard on me due to my increasingly bad insomnia. To make it worse, the stores in my city all just bumped up their closing times 1-2 hours.
Signal	Does anyone manage to get their insomnia under control and in a place where they are sleeping 6+ hours of quality sleep... then they go on holiday and they are unable to sleep??I have been sleeping well recently but then spent a few nights away on holiday and I feel shits hit the fan again. I couldn’t sleep😢
Signal	Last week I went four days in a row without sleeping, it was hell. Though, this night I slept like a baby! I only woke up to my alarm telling me it was time for my online classes.I'm still anxious and tired, but, ay, at least I'm not gonna die from not sleeping for to long. :))
NotSignal	I tried sleeping while being seated and it worked for me even though it took about an hour and a half before i could fall asleep. I still got to bed once i started feeling too sleepy though but sitting was a huge catalyst to the process. Has anyone tried it?
NotSignal	A little pissed I have to learn how stupid and shitty my body is before an intense training day for work but at least I guess I know. I had a feeling this may have been the case a year ago, and as I look in my food journals I see that any time I had eaten eggs, I can't sleep at ALL that night (same goes for whey protein.)
Signal	So this is kind of hard to explain, so please bear with me here. For several weeks now, I have been finding myself wide awake between 2-4am. My eyes are wide open and I’m deep in thought, the only thing is, I have no idea when I woke up?! And it dawns on me “I’m awake! Since when?” It takes me anywhere from 1-3 hours to fall back asleep, and I’m finding myself constantly exhausted. I’ve always been one to have very vivid dreams, I also experience sleep paralysis, and lucid dreaming. So what I’m wondering is if I’m transitioning from lucid dreaming to awake? But I don’t actually recall a dream, but I also don’t recall waking up at all! And I’m WIDE awake, not groggy or foggy at all. Has anyone here experienced this?! I do have a high stress job, who doesn’t? But I’m exhausted.
Signal	It’s too late to take melatonin( I have to be up around 7:30. I’ve tried counting down from 100, listening to a Birmingham YouTube video, and reading boring news articles. My brain just won’t shut off -.- Any hell would be greatly appreciated
NotSignal	Im in a really weird spot with my Insomnia rn. I dont even really know if you could call it that.So basically, everytime i go to sleep, i battle with Anxiety about losing consciousness and having to dream. I get extremely Anxious thinking about that i have to lose my consciousness and endure extremely vivid and weird dreams every single night. But, when i actually do fall asleep, i usally sleep through the whole night peacefully and wake up pretty refreshed, its just that i have these near panic attacks every night because of my fear of the state youre in while sleeping itself.Anybody got some Advice for me or is maybe experiencing something similar aswell?I appreciate any Reply from you guys!
Signal	For the last couple weeks or so I have had trouble staying asleep. I am a 21 year old female college senior and “graduate” this week. This is exhausting me mentally and physically as I can’t sleep for more than 3-4 hours at a time. I’ve tried what feels like everything. Melatonin, essential oils, klonopin, Benadryl. Nothing has been able to get me to sleep through the night. I consistently fall asleep around 11 (I don’t have trouble falling asleep) and then wake up at 3 am in a panic usually from a bad dream/night terror every night. Then I stay up usually til around 7-8 and can maybe fall back asleep for a few hours but I just wake up more exhausted every day and just feel like crying because I’m just so tired. I just want one night where I sleep completely through the night, and suggestions or options would be appreciated!
Signal	I went to bed at 10:00 and woke up at 3:00. I've been unable to sleep since and tried everything under the sun - melatonin, taking a hot shower, Benadryl as a last resort. Usually, Benadryl helps me fall asleep but it's just making my heart race and I gave up on falling asleep tbh. Probably going to go for a run, start my day and try to nap a little this afternoon as I woke up last night at 3:00 as well (got some sleep from 6:00 to 11:00 that night though).I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do. I usually sleep 10 hours a night...
Signal	It’s been rough folks, had a talk with my doctor a while ago and he said take melatonin or Zoloft. I took melatonin and I didn’t even feel a difference. Stood wide awake the whole night with my eyes closed. It’s been over three weeks now with this problem. He recommends to take Zoloft for the next 6 months. But I did my research and I saw that there’s a chance it could destroy your libido. For a long time or forever. What’s the point of life if you can’t have your big PP? The search for sleep continues
NotSignal	My IG is @itsfaithlow if anyone wants to check it out. If you vibe with it cool if not no worries I’ll still love y’all anyways. I’m also on Spotify and iTunes. I’ll go hide now guys 🙈[Letting Me Go ](https://youtu.be/yOmwxTuOBDA)
NotSignal	So every night I would try to go to sleep I would wake up every 3 or 4 hours, but for some reason I can't tell if I am a sleep or not or just really deep in thought. Last night I thought I slept a decent 6 hour but felt horrible the entire day like I haven't slept at all. So I am questioning if I really did sleep. Is this normal with Insomnia and does it eventually go away?
Signal	I haven’t slept well in probably a year.. Biggest habit in the past was waking up in the middle of night after sleeping 2 or 3 hours and either not going back to bed up staying up for a couple hours before going back to sleep. After awhile that stopped. Then the struggle was trying to sleep more than 4 or 5 hours a night. Honestly don’t even remember how long that went on, maybe a couple of weeks when I was beginning hypothyroidism medication.Now with the quarantine and noise at home I sleep 3 or 4 hours at a time, get waken up by early birds in the house, then go back to bed for another 4 or 5 hours. Sometimes when I’m stressed even more than usual again I struggle to fall back asleep.This dreaded video of a ted talk always crawls into my head when I’ve had a particularly difficult time sleeping. The guy explains he had unhealthy habits and only slept 4 hours a night in the past. That alone gives me anxiety because I can relate in a way but obviously not entirely. Then he continues to explain a horrifying panic attack that sent him to the hospital, where a doctor tells him he’s fine but a guy with an identical or similar case died recently... you can see where the nerves kick in...Then, My anxiety and ocd take care of the rest... I’ve had an obsession with death for the longest of time. I often have nightmares that scare me awaken or make me afraid to ever sleep(family raised me superstitious)... dreams of skeletons, people dying, etc..And lastly the sheer guilt of not sleeping just makes everything else above worse... I don’t recommend being a hypochondriac... or an anxious person... who’s also depressed... 😅Sorry if I am using the wrong subreddit, I thought it was best to reach out to people who could likely relate and are experienced in these issues.
Signal	I have insomnia brought on by antidepressants (Sertraline 100mg). My doctor gave me leaflets on dealing with insomnia but none of the methods have helped me. I am waiting for my upcoming appointment to discuss this, but in the meantime I was hoping an antihistamine would help. I've looked around and the most recommended ones seem to be PIRITON (chlorpheniramine maleate) or BENADRYL (diphenhydramine). Has anyone used either of these to treat insomnia before, and if so which one did you use?I have taken Phenargan (promethazine) in the past but I'm not able to take it with Sertraline so that's not an option for me.Thanks in advance :)
Signal	My roommate is sick and so our place is hot as hell. Very uncomfortable. Looks like tonight is gonna be hell. Honestly this is the original cause of my insomnia. Really gotta go buy some earplugs and a fan. Is there a particular brand of earplugs anyone uses that you you recommended?
NotSignal	Anyone had any experiences with Ashwangandha? I read that its often used for stress and also some people cured their insomnias with it.. Lavender and valerian root don't do much for me, i wonder if Ashwagandha is any better :/
NotSignal	I'm a Fine Art and Psychology Major at University. I try to combine my two majors as much as possible. Thus why I am doing an art concentration on insomnia and other sleep disorders. I also suffer from chronic insomnia so this project is pretty personal. If anyone is willing to share how chronic sleep deprivation has affected their personal lives, mental, and physical health, that would be greatly appreciated. More specifically, what are the major/daily differences between poor nights rest and your disorder? I also welcome any idea/tips for my art. Thanks for any replies!
NotSignal	I’ve posted on this board before, as I’ve been suffering from maintenance insomnia for over 2 years. Many times when I wake up in the middle of the night, I feel nauseous. At first, I was attributing the nausea to anxiety, but this past week, I’ve felt nausea and I definitely knew I wasn’t anxious. I even felt a really bad taste in my mouth. I’m starting to wonder if maybe the source of my insomnia is a gastrointestinal problem. Has anybody had stomach problems be the cause of their insomnia? And when I go see the doctor, what should I suggest they look into (since most doctors I’ve met aren’t knowledgeable in insomnia)?
Signal	I have insomnia: takes me 30 min to 2 hours to fall asleep, and I wake up 3 to 5 times usually. To compensate I just sleep longer: 10 hours, because you need 7-9 hours which I don't get because I can't fall asleep and I wake up. But maybe 10 hours of sleep is the reason I have insomnia in the first place...I've read that oversleeping is very bad. Yet I don't wanna test this myself because if insomnia wasn't caused by oversleeping I'd just deprive myself of sleep further aggravating my situation. So hopefully some of you have tested this, or know this.
Signal	Slept 3 hours last night and kept falling asleep while driving to work, I don't know what to do. This has happened twice in the past week. I fell asleep 10+ times while driving.
Signal	Yesterday I have taken trazadone for the first time and I got a bunch of side effects. For the first hour my sinuses got swollen and it was difficult to breathe. Other than this the night went pretty well. I actually got a much better sleep that usually.In the morning I felt a little groggy but that's normal for me and I'm used to this. What is completely new to me is a constant migraine. I've had it all day today. I read this is a common side effect and I'm not sure whether I should stick with the drug and push through or give it up. I can't imagine having a headache everytime I take it. Did anyone have a similar experience and did the side effects eventually go away?
Signal	Has anyone tried combining the two? I've heard that using a low dose of thc with cbd can be more beneficial than using cbd alone. I'm not looking to get high, I just want to be able to stay asleep and reduce my anxiety. My friend is giving me 5mg thc gummies and I have 500mg (per bottle) cbd... if I took only a small bite of the gummy and 1ml of the cbd do you think that would work? I have no real knowledge on this topic so I would like to see it anyone has actual experience with this combination.I'm also on zoloft 50mg for about 6 weeks now... I never used to have sleep issues so I believe this medication and my general anxiety/panic disorder induced my poor sleeping.
Signal	I’ve been up for nearly 35 hours, and on one hand I just want to sleep because my body is utterly exhausted, but now that I’m lying in bed I’m wide awake and freaking out about trying to sleep. I’m prone to having intense nightmares and when I wake up from them, it’s very hard to distinguish that it was just a dream. A big part of coming back to reality from those was my SO in bed with me, but my LDR prevents that from happening now. I mostly just wanted to vent and see who else experienced the same cycle of anxiety and insomnia from nightmares. Good luck to everyone out there trying to get rest!
NotSignal	Tfw I'm almost asleep and realize I didn't turn my sound back on (on my phone) after work and then have to get up to turn it back on. Wide awake again :(
Signal	Lately because of the Coronavirus school has been closed so I have messed up my sleeping schedule. In the beginning I knew that I shouldn’t mess up my sleeping schedule so I went to bed around 1 or 2 am. But after that I stayed up later and later. For 2 weeks I have been going to bed around 4 am but for some reason tonight I couldn’t go to bed it is now 7 am and I feel like I just woke up and I’m not tired at all but sometimes I will be tired but not go to bed because my thoughts are racing. I will try everything to go to bed like asmr, relaxing music, and sleepy tea. I can’t really read because all of the books I have make me more awake. And trust me I have tried. And you might be thinking maybe I should use melatonin but my parents say that I don’t need that and I can just go to bed they just don’t understand. And I feel like to go to bed I need something that will knock me on my butt I will be so tired. I can maybe try it again and convince my parents I need it or do you guys have better suggestions? But anyways my strategy to go to bed early is to stay up till night time and by that point I will be exhausted. I bet before that I will be really tired but I cannot take any naps it will be like around 36 hours of me staying up but I’m a little concerned because the internet says that’s bad and you will start to see visions. I have though stayed up for like 30 hours and I was so exhausted that I couldn’t keep my eyes opened any longer for the night time. Do you guys feel like this is a good idea or not. Please any advice or just what your going threw will help me get threw this.
Signal	I’ve never had trouble sleeping until the past 6 months, due to a diagnosis of Graves disease(hyperthyroidism) and all the stress associated with it. 50 mg trazodone hasn’t done anything. I tried 100 lastnight, not much better. Benzos help, but that’s a slippery slope I’m not trying to go down. Doc wants to try seroquel. I’ve read about the terrible side effects, do those still occur at super low doses? Like 6 mg? Anyone been on a low dose long term that can attest?What else can I try with my doctor before seroquel?I don’t want to try ambien, etc..Been trying all kinds of herbs, teas, tinctures, otc stuff, seeing a therapist..Valerian worked great at first, but works similar to benzos, so the whole tolerance thing is still an issue.. plus I had to take massive doses for it to work ( like 10x the recommended dose)
Signal	I don't understand my sleep schedule or SLEEP at all I'm currently so sick of it. This whole quarantine gave me my insomnia back I was able to sleep after I had 2-3 weeks of insomnia during feb and kind of fixed it around march then the whole lockdown started haven't had my stress/anxiety under control and on top of that PMS/PMDD symptoms aren't really so great. When I do fall asleep I wake up 2-3 hrs after and once I try to go back to sleep my mind feels awake? like I could be laying in bed for a good 1 hr and I'd still be awake? or it seems like I did sleep because I felt like I dreamt not sure if I did dream but I had a dream?? I'm not even sure if I'm making any sense rn but I just want an end to it all. On and off because yesterday I just got a good decent amount of sleep woke up a few times maybe because I was so exhausted from previous night also had 2-3 hrs of sleep and now I'm paying for the fact that I got tht decent sleep so now I got approximately3 HRS OF SLEEP AGAIN. I've tried all the supplements. Melatonin but only 3 mg. Magnesium glycinate doesn't seem to help. Cbd oil tincture in my chamomile tea. Essential oil lavender diffuser. My brain is killing me. Also my body feels so weak, I feel like a blob. Suffering from spondy and my back is just not having it I need sleep to recover and heal my muscles. How can I do tht if I'm not getting REM sleep. Every muscle feels achy. I realize that I'm so tense when sleeping? Everything hurts. I just need to know that people get over this and get through it. Please message me if you know ways that help you get a good sleep. Feeling really hopeless and scared that all my physical pain is due to something more and not just insomnia related.
NotSignal	Not sure what to do at this point. Nothing works to help me sleep. Is there anything I can get my primary doctor to prescribe me until I find a new psychiatrist?
NotSignal	Took two zzquill. I am thinking of taking more. Most I've taken in one night is like 12 I think over the course of 1 night
Signal	Hey everyone, I could really use some help on an issue I've been struggling with for years now. First off, some quick info:* 40/live alone* Self-employed in education, I tutor which means I usually have no immediate reason to get started before noonish. I've always been a night person. During my university years, this usually was no real problem. I simply was very active until 02:00 a.m., I could tolerate having to get up in the morning relatively easily. My problem is that I am constantly battling with my own sleeping rhythm. I suffer from moderate insomnia to begin with, but if I do not keep strict discipline regarding get up time, my rhythm quickly devolves into sleeping around 06:00 a.m. and waking up around 14:00 or 15:00. It's like I gradually devolve into a self-induced jetlag which becomes problematic very quickly.Because of my work, I rarely have a real reason to get up before noon. Also, right now it's the summer break where I live (most derailments happen during vacations), and at this moment I feel the need to get things right again, for numerous reasons. I sometimes try pulling an all-nighter, but this is exhausting during the day and impacts the quality of my work. Also, even though I might fall fast asleep the next day, it's often not much of a cure. So Reddit, what are your tips on getting a derailed rhythm back on track without truly draconian measures?
NotSignal	I had a panic attack midway between falling asleep and snoring...which.woke me up and... somehow.SEVERED THE LINK BETWEEEN SLEEP AND SNORING.I now begin snoring without having fallen asleep. You heard that right. My breathing SWITCHES TO A SNORE.... WHILE IM FUCKING CONSCIOUS, the sound of which keeps me from falling asleep.WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.
Signal	My puppy had pavlo so my mom and i had a deal that she would take the morning shift while i take the night shift. After weeks and weeks of this i can't sleep on 10-12 pm and wake up in the morning. Its always lie restless in bed for like minutes or hours while doing nothing. The problem is that i feel that fatigue that comes with not sleeping, yet i can't act on it and sleep. I've tried not sleeping for a whole day then try to sleep the next day on around 10pm and i just end up waking in around 1:00 am. I would like to try sleeping on the proper bed time but as stated above, i would just lie there in the dark doing nothing but count sheeps for hours. I'm thinking of buying over the counter sleeping pills, but what is this subreddit's advice?
Signal	I’ve done at-home tests and been prescribed various medications and been to a number of doctors but am being denied (in part due to my “young” age of 30s). F*CK YOU AETNA AND EVICORE. May every last one of you get a UTI that never resolves and cannot be helped with medication.In the process of attempting to overturn it but was told not to get hopes up. If anyone has gone through this and can offer advice I’d love you forever.
Signal	Melatonin. Nytol. Cbd. 5-htp. Headspace app. Reading. Therapy. Exercise. Cold room. Warm room. Eat. Don’t eat. Lavender. Neals wrist roll. Night nurse. Booze. Weed. Magnesium. Living healthy and being active. Sex - hard (!) to say tbh not really.What has worked :Zopiclone 1-1.5 pills of 7mg. Lorazepham 1 - 1.5 pills cant recall strength.I don’t want to get reliant on sleeping pills but I am heading that way fast. I’m 38 sleep issues began at university. Just sharing for the hell.
Signal	I've always had a suspicion that I've been a bit of an insomniac. I always described myself as a night person and I stay up into the wee hours of the morning more often than I would like. Getting 6 or less hours of restless sleep has never been an uncommon occurrence. But it's never been this bad.Saturday evening I began to notice how difficult it was becoming for me to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. Saturday it was 3 am, Sunday I could barely fall asleep at all. Work roles around at 9 on Monday and i'm exhausted, having barely gotten any sleep. I force myself to stay up until 10 so I can reset my sleep schedule. At 9 I shut off all electronic devices in my house including my phone and pull The Fellowship Of The Ring off my bookshelf (the prologue on Hobbit history always helps to put me to sleep). I lay in bed and pop a melatonin tablet. I begin reading expecting to become drowsy in a half an hour. An hour passes. Then two. Soon it's midnight. I readjust my alarm clock to later in the morning to try and give myself some more time to rest. The hours continue to slip by. I feel sick but not tired, almost energetic. As the clock goes to 5 I begin to get delirious. I call my dad and ask him what I should do, he picks me up and takes me to the ER. In the ER I mentioned that some increase in anxiety in my personal life may have been a contributing factor. I got prescribed Ambien and Lexapro. I was still unable to sleep by 7 that morning so the doctor gave me vallium and my dad drove me home. As I laid in bed I could see the grain in my wood bedside table turn into a million tiny bugs that crawled up and down the surface. The pile of clothing on my floor began to move as if it was breathing. I didn't think much of it and finally fell asleep.This whole experience was pretty brutal. Does any sufferer of an anxiety/insomnia combo on here have any advice they could give to a newcomer on how not to repeat what just happened?
NotSignal	Anyone here ever decide to live with the insomnia then dealing with drug side effects? I can either be awake for a few days or be a zombie the next day and accomplish nothing. But staying awake increases my depression. What devil do some of you choose?
Signal	**I'm new to this subreddit and I'm asking for a friend who doesn't have a reddit account, so here are her words:**Hello, I'm curious if anyone has encountered similar insomnia issues: I've been having issues regarding insomnia for years, which most commonly shows in waking up throughout the night and switching from side to side – I usually wake up after every dream and then I need a few minutes to go back to sleep. Almost every night I wake up at around 3 or 4 AM after roughly three or four hours of sleep (sometimes I have to use the toilet or I wake up for no reason). From this moment on, my sleep is even worse than before, sometime I require half an hour or even more to fall back asleep. In case I do fall back asleep, I wake up every 10 minutes until I give up and get up in the morning. I can never sleep longer than until 7 or 8 am. Since I was little I've had trouble with sleeping, had a lot of nightmares and I didn't want to sleep alone in my room. I also had a fear from sleeping (when bedtime was approaching) because I thought everything would be the same like the nights before – filled with nightmares. This went on all the way until high school and then it stopped. Even though I currently have calm and diverse dreams (a lot of dreams every night), I can't sleep and stay in a deep sleeping state. A lot of the time I wake up so exhausted that it might just be better if I didn't even bother with sleep. Every now and then I have better nights, but I still don't remember at any point in my life, where I would sleep through the whole night without waking up and having trouble going back to sleep. I tried a lot of natural herbs, I avoid using any sleeping pills because i'm determined to solve these issues the natural way. Let me just mention that my sleep differs when I sleep away from home or for example on vacation. If there is someone next to me I don't wake up as much as usual – but it's not always the case.I would be happy for any sort of advice or opinion from anyone, who had similar issues and how he coped with them. Thank you.
Signal	It's been like a couple of months that I've started to having troubles at falling asleep. Even when I'm exhausted it takes me at least an hour to fall asleep, imagine right now, without excessive efforts (phisically talking). The point is that I'm terribly afraid of losing consciousness, even though I know that it's a natural process. It feels like dying a little, don't know if that's clear. So I find myself like trying to not fall asleep, waiting in my bedroom for hours. Has anyone here experienced something similar? Suggestions?PS. I have some mental issues, I've never had the possibility to actually verify them but I know that I'm probably depressed
NotSignal	Im anout to move my new apartment, I dont know what suit me the most: foam or spring matress? I really dont know what to choose because I enjoy them both.
NotSignal	This is a very expensive medicine, and I can't find to much info on it. Its somewhat relaxing, but not sedating. I can't say I have much of an opinion on it. It just feels like maybe a more clean melatonin with no hangover. Very curious what other's thoughts are on this medicine
NotSignal	I recently went through alot of stress and it's mostly gone but some physical symptoms are left so some stress persist.My symptoms:Very very low stomach acid (reflux without acid),Heart palpitations randomly and amplified after meals,Very bad insomia- used to sleep perfect beforeTitinus 24/7 only recently happened,RestlessMy observations- white tea seems to make me less anxious.Is this gaba deficiency or maybe elevated cortisol?I'm 19 and don't smoke or drink.i follow a paleo diet and excersise regularly (stopped recently but started excersise yesterday)
NotSignal	Every night as I lay in bed, my eyes closed, I can feel myself drifting unconscious. This feeling of it taking over my mind feels scary. I hate it.How can I get over this?
Signal	I am a late-20s female and always slept really well. Due to various stressors in my work and personal life, I've begin to really struggle with sleep. However, while I feel that the underlying cause of my sleeplessness is stress and anxiety, it feels really different week to week. For example, in my first week I was only up for 1-2 hours a night a couple times a week. When I did wake up, my mind was racing with anxious thoughts that I recognized as irrational but couldn't seem to control. The sleeplessness was nowhere near as bad as the anxiety, itself. It was so unbearable that I began taking citalopram at 10mg per week.The second week I started waking up a bit more frequently. About 3-4 times per week I would wake up with less anxiety. Instead, it felt like I was getting up only to pee, and just couldn't fall back asleep afterward. But there was definitely less anxiety.I've stopped drinking 2 hours before bed and now I don't wake up to pee. Instead, the past 2 weeks I've been up every single night for about 4 hours at a time. I don't feel anxiety, or anything at all. I've started to resign myself to laying in bed, or I'll just get up and do some work. My hours of sleeplessness have also gotten very consistent. I'm usually up without fail at 3 am and will be able to fall back asleep at 7 am for a couple hours before I get up for work. I guess what concerns me is not so much my changing symptoms, but the progressively growing increase in my waking hours. Though I am really curious as to why and how my sleeplessness can look so different from week to week. I've just recently upped my citalopram prescription to 20 mg, and I'm going to start taking it at night instead of the morning in hopes that it will help me fall asleep. I'm not on any other medications atm. For those of you who have had insomnia for a while, is this how it started for you? Does anyone have any tips to change the path I seem to be on?Any tips, advice, or experience sharing would be greatly appreciated. Glad to find a community like this. Best of luck, everyone.
Signal	I literally had one of my most stressful days of my life today, almost everything went wrong and it was just a lot. At the end of it I had some kind of mental breakdown because of how exhausted I was with everything. I thought that I would be tired out enough by the events of the day PLUS a mental breakdown/panic attack but its 6 AM and I'm still wide awake. I still feel like I have a lot of energy physically even though my mind is like.. gone. I hate this I just want to sleep and forget about today but I can't.
Signal	So yeah I went to bed at 10:30 pm but i usually just fall asleep by browsing on my phone after 30mins/1hour. Now this time I didn’t picked up my phone and just kept thinking and when I took my phone it was so late and I became anxious about missing a night of sleep. Currently 1:21 AM and i just hope I won’t be up for the night. I know i’ll survive, but I have important things to do and i’m scared.
NotSignal	I was awake for 32 hours before I finally fell asleep at 2pm just to have my brother wake me up at 6pm saying that “mom said to wake you up because you shouldn’t be sleeping at 6pm”. This is so FRUSTRATING. My family keeps doing this because I’m not sleeping at the time I’m “supposed” to be sleeping.
Signal	(18F, GAD, OCD)I suffer from depersonalization episodes frequently since 2018, I don't know if this makes sense but that has made me incredibly scared of any type of medication/drug/drink/etc that makes me feel dizzy or out of 'my mind'. I tried weed a couple of times and had a huge panic attack every single time. I'm not a huge fan of coffee and i don't drink alcohol unless i'm in a comfortable situation. I guess the point of this is, i don't know whether or not to try Xanax to sleep. My anxiety has affected my school performance/life in general tremendously. I'm on a summer break so it's not that important right now but i've been falling asleep at 4:00am (thanks to melatonin) and waking up at 4pm for over 3 months.I have exams and i'm starting school again soon so for obvious reasons I can't keep my schedule like this. My best friend struggles with her mental health and she takes a lot of medication, Xanax included and that's what she uses to sleep every night.I'm considering taking some, should I?(Before you guys say no, I have exams at 8am and i need to wake up at 6 to get to school in time, I can't risk not falling asleep the night before, if it wasn't important i just wouldn't take it)TLDR: How was your experience with Xanax? How does it make you feel? Could It possibly trigger a panic attack? How did it make you feel the first time you took it? How would you describe your experience?
NotSignal	I can only sleep for 2.5hours max before I wake up, then try to fall asleep again, then wake up again 2.5hours later. I go through this cycle 3-4 times a night. I'm sure others here have the same problem.I'm wondering if this problem has any official term so we can research more about it and find out how to fix it? I used to sleep through the entire night as a kid, but no longer as an adult. What I would give to go back to that.

NotSignal	A common complaint for many when dealing with sleepless nights is that “they just can’t turn off their mind”. There is scientific evidence behind the fact that if brainwave activity is too fast, we are physically unable to achieve the state of rest that our bodies need to recover and repair themselves overnight. Fortunately, there is a way to turn the mind off and calm yourself mind and body to achieve a state of deep sleep:**1. Slow it down**Many of us take shallow, incomplete breaths as we go throughout the day—and we extend this ineffective practice well into the night. Few of us know how to employ the use of our lungs AND diaphragm, taking it all in and then holding it for a detoxifying release. The simple act of slowing down our breath also slows down our brain wave activity, making it easier to fall asleep. Slower breathing allows the parasympathetic nervous system to take over, allowing your body to enter a rest/digest state of being. Improving the function of the parasympathetic nervous system improves all aspects of health, particularly the digestive system. Those of us with leaky gut can rejoice, as employing breathing techniques is a very simple remedy for reducing digestive complications. Your entire body is repaired and restored as you attain a deep, satisfying sleep.**2. Employ the 4-7-8 technique**According to the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, the 4-7-8 technique is just as effective as meditation for turning off the mind and allowing you to live in the present moment. Sit upright and cross-legged on your bed with your mouth closed and the tongue on the roof of the mouth. Breathe in deeply for a count of 4, then hold in for 7 counts. Finally, exhale through your mouth slowly for a count of 8. Repeat for at least four breath cycles and see how much better you feel and sleep!**What is the 4-7-8 breathing exercise?**Pranayama (literally translated “regulation of breath”) is an old Indian technique to reduce stress and increase relaxation. It is also mostly used in yoga and pilates.One of the most popular interpretations of this technique is the 4-7-8 breathing method, which is a breathing pattern that is developed and popularised by Dr. Adrew Weil, a Harvard trained medical doctor with a focus on holistic health.**How to do the 4-7-8 breathing exercise?**The 7 simple steps to falling asleep fast using the breathing exercise:1. Take a comfortable position.2. Place the tip of your tongue against the backside of your upper teeth.3. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a ‘shhhhh’ sound.4. Inhale quietly through your nose for 4 seconds, with your mouth closed.5. Hold your breath for 7 seconds.6. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a ‘shhhhh’ sound for 8 seconds7. Repeat this breathing process for around 4 times, making you complete 4 breathing cycles.Some people may find it hard to keep their breath in for 7 seconds, and make you feel light-headed. A small note is that you can do this exercise with a smaller amount of counts, within the same ratio.You could use a 3 – 5 – 6 breathing pattern, or a 2 – 3,5 – 4 for example. This will give you about the same effect.Small tips when doing this exercise:&#x200B;* Keep the tongue on your upper teeth while breathing out. * Breath in with abdominal breathing to optimize oxygen intake. * Do this exercise around 2 to 3 times a day, to maximize the chances of this technique working. **3. Use traditional, meditative breaths**One of the first and most vital components of meditation and mindfulness is breathing. Training yourself to breathe as you would in meditation does wonders for turning off the mind and helping you to live in the present moment. With your eyes closed, focus on slow, deep breaths, paying attention to where it rises and falls within the body. Practice this technique for 10-15 minutes daily and reap the benefits from the very first session.**4. Kapalbhati breathing**Kapalbhati breathing, known as “blowing”, is a technique that clears stagnant breath from the body; it is also symbolic for cleansing the mind of toxic and unwanted thoughts and emotions. It also helps you to cleanse the body by stimulating the lungs and digestive system as you apply forceful pressure when blowing the breath. Take in a breath through your nose and deliver it in short, powerful bursts out through your mouth; envision yourself letting go of anything that may be holding you back from achieving your perfect, restful sleep.**5. Practice alternate nostril breathing**Mouth breathing subconsciously tells the body that you are anxious and stressed; conversely, nostril breathing is an indicator that the body is balanced and moving toward a state of homeostasis. Sit on your bed cross legged, holding the right nostril closed with one finger while you breathe in through the left. Switch sides and hold the left nostril down while you exhale through your right nostril. Repeat several times, switching the order in which you inhale and exhale through each side of your nose.**6. Double down on your exhale**Most yogis know that it’s all about the exhale. Making your exhale last twice as long as your inhale does wonders for calming both mind and body. The process of counting the length of your inhales vs. exhales is a very effective substitute for the traditional counting of sheep. Sit or lie comfortably in your bed and, with eyes closed, breathe in for a count of 3-4; exhale through your mouth for twice as long as your inhale. Repeat several cycles to experience a zen-like, calm effect on both mind and body.I hope anyone finds this useful. If you tried everything, from pills to therapy, and nothing is working yet – breathing may be an answer.
Signal	After about the 5th day marks when the audio and visual hallucinations begin. Anyone else go into full blown psychosis after multiple days with no sleep? Hasn’t happened in a few months but thankfully I still had half of my seroquel script tucked away to say the night! And no it was not drug induced insomnia...
Signal	Wow it's been a while since my insomnia has been this bad, i kept my anxiety in check for spending the night here , Thanks Redditers for keeping me company yall the best, and i still need to go to work. Yikes
NotSignal	..& wake up 4 hours later because you’re incapable of sleeping any longer than thatThese are the days I cry on my way to work lol
NotSignal	i haven't slept early in a long time. it's been affecting me now and my eye is bothering me. it keeps on twitching. what do i do? i think it's a sign of stress and not sleeping well. god damn, it makes me so uncomfortable.
Signal	Insomnia and anxiety can both go fuck themselves lol. Sorry, just had to get it out!
NotSignal	Lately I haven't been able to sleep because when I'm in bed my hands mostly but also my feet feel swollen dry and start to tingle. This increases until I move around but doesn't go away. Its almost disorienting. My breathing seems to be affected also. Always something......
NotSignal	Few days ago I had posted about the benefits that correct breathing brought for me. I'm experiencing another huge perk! My nostrils are both open wide. This has finally happened after many years of suffering from blocked nose. I was really fed up of not having open nostrils without my nasal spray, to the point where I was really considering a nasal obstruction surgery.
NotSignal	Last night, I had a dream about my best friend that passed away. In the dream, she was in the other room getting ready to die and had written a letter that I was reading. I start crying really hard as I was reading it, because I knew I was getting ready to lose her. The feelings were so strong that it woke me up in a physical state of almost crying. Like, my eyes were starting to well up, my throat was tense, etc. It's not the first time that this has happened, but it's been awhile. I was just wondering how common that is amongst the insomniac community here.
NotSignal	We all think we do very interesting stuff or very weird stuff but I think we all pretty much do same thing. This should be interesting :)
NotSignal	so for backstory i've had insomnia since pretty much the day i was born, along with severe anxiety and ocd along with a slew of other health issues, nothing new.but what /is/ new is this random twitching when i'm trying to fall asleep. the other night i only got around 30 mins of actual sleep cause of it, and last night thankfully i was able to get more sleep...but i was in bed for 16 hours trying. it's like whenever i finally start to fall asleep, i get this sudden jolt in my chest that sends my body into panic-mode and wakes me back up, or some part of my body just twitches and wakes me up as well. and this happens over and over for hours and hours.i looked some stuff up and unfortunately was met with fatal insomnia, something i'm /sure/ none of you have ever heard before/s. needless to say my anxiety/ocd has now fixated on it despite it obviously not being the case which hasn't helped anything at all. so my question is, to hopefully quiet those insane worries, and maybe get some advice; does this happen to anyone else? especially randomly? i can't remember it ever happening to me before the other night, which is the part that freaks me out the most. i have no idea what to do about this.
NotSignal	I sleep during the day and need it to be dark when I sleep. I decided I’d get some construction paper to tape to the top half of my windows, hoping that would help a little. Problem is it’s fall which means windows are open often to keep the house cold. Also my windows are so blocked up with pillows and extra blankets against them, it’s hard to tape up the windows. I have blackout shades and curtains but even with them and the windows closed, light gets through. Might have to black out the entire window.
NotSignal	Probably will be here for the next hour or so
NotSignal	When I say AT ALL I mean my brain was hyperactive and also I experience impending doom.
Signal	I've been only able to sleep for about 2-3 hours no matter when or after how long i have been up. I tried everything. tried making a pattern, didnt work. Tried staying up for long cuz i thought maybe i am sleeping when i am not really tired or sleepy so that happens and didnt work either. It's been like this for a bit over a month i think, at first it wasnt really an issue, just felt a bit grumpy after waking up but it was okay. Now i feel that way the whole time i am up and i am always tired. I dont even know if that can be insomnia but it is true that i am having trouble sleeping. Tbh i dont know what i'll do if this keeps going, it's even starting to take its toll me mentally and stressing me a bit.
Signal	does anyone here have insomnia purely from anxiety? I can't get to sleep because my anxiety disorder is so bad that I have adrenaline going through my system and feelings of impending doom all the time. I only sleep for a couple of hours a night for about three nights or so and then my body completely shuts down because it has no energy left and I get a normal sleep for a couple of days and then the cycle starts again.
Signal	I had a lot of caffeine today so not sure if it's that, but I've been trying to fall asleep for hours now and I'm just so frustrated. I took a 5 mg melatonin and not much happened. This sucks.
NotSignal	No matter how much I try I can't seem to fall asleep. Typically I just lay in bed with my eyes closes for hours. I haven't slept in 3 days. Any help?
NotSignal	So my insomnia is okay now....Cause of covid lmao, just tested positive, I've been having symptons for 3 days now, and one of the new ones I just had today is extreme sleepiness, isn't that fucking great? Now I can sleep for 12 hours, and the only downside is imminent death! YAY THANK YOU UNIVERSE, YOU ABSOLUTE PIECE OF SHIT
Signal	Tonight I couldn’t sleep at all, I have some kinda anxiety issues, i’m used to not sleep some night but this time was different, i know the reason why I didn’t sleep (because usually i don’t know why), I don’t know if it’s more disturbing me what happened with he guy I kinda “dated” or my university exams, do you guys know how to avoid thoughts before going to sleep?
NotSignal	Maybe this is something you've heard a hundred times over and the advice is the same but nonetheless I am really struggling. I go through cycles of staying up for 24+ hours and then sleeping for 12 hours for about a month. I get anxious when it's 4:30 and can't fall asleep because I'm anxious about not falling asleep.. I've been so unproductive and unhappy with myself and yet it's the same thing every night with me staring at my curtains and watching my room light up. I'm so done with my insomnia and I was wondering if anyone else struggles with this and what helps them.
NotSignal	I live in a place where it's usally around 23 degrees C (around 70 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day and around 15 (60) during the day. I already have to battle with not falling/staying asleep during most nights, but right now it's a bit past midnight and still 25 degrees (73), and during the day it's around 37 (100) degrees. This will be the case for tge whole week, and nobody here is accustomed to this heat. Long story short, my insomnia is even worse now with that heat, and of course I will not fall asleep for quite some time.
NotSignal	My heart is beating fast or , not so fast that i can't breath but i can feel it's not normal and i think it's starting to affect my breathing especially the last few days. lately I lay down on bed for almost 12 hours ( 8 hours just trying to fall asleep or go back to sleep because i wake up in the middle of night ) and when i wake up i can feel my heart is heavy.So is it because of insomnia or could it be a physical thing and should i see a doctor?*Note that I'm 20 years old with diabetes so ..
NotSignal	hey so this is kind of lengthy and sorry I’m on mobile but I used to study lucid dreaming and created a method to help me sleep almost on demand, I noticed on the verge of falling asleep my brain would start forming incoherent sentences and just overall words that didn’t even make sense. This is how I turned it into a method for winding down my brain in order to go to sleep quicker: lots of times when our brain is stringing together sentences it almost subconsciously considers alternative words to be used which can keep the brain even more active, before I go to sleep I try to express my thoughts in sounds instead of words, similar to the way people sometimes sigh when they’re sad or frustrated, or make noises of excitement etc, this helps my brain imitate the verge of rem and when I’m turning over previous events in the day I’ll try and think in pictures and even just made up words that just articulate the emotions instead of letting my brain try and ‘search’ for the right word. I hope this helps and please let me know down in the comments if you see any results!!!
NotSignal	and some other things my brain tells me when i'm trying to sleep
Signal	I finally went to see a doctor about my insomnia and he prescribed zopiclone, but not gonna lie, he kind of scared me a bit. I was told it's a strong sedative, so far so good, but that it's high risk, and have dangerous potentials. And despite me asking, he didn't really give any straight answers. I did some Google searching and it's not really clearing it up much. So I don't know if people are getting high off this stuff or if just dumbs you down, which is good for me, since you're not supposed to go drive, work or whatever while taking it anyways. The less I can think the better the chance of falling asleep.Has anyone ever used this medication for insomnia? Do you know of any dangers of taking it or recieved similar warnings? I'm really anxious about taking any pills so I don't want to take them until I'm comfortable, but I also really need help with sleep because I'm getting desperate.
NotSignal	It’s 1 in the morning and I’m going crazy. It has been night after night of no sleeping and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I hate this so much.
NotSignal	Haven’t slept a wink. It’s 6am. I have to get up at 9. Heeeelllllpppp
NotSignal	My dad is passing out in about a minute he works 12 hours for 5 days a week and he can sleep trough out everything storms, Parties this man just pass out everywhere and I’m like how does he do it lmao I lay in bed for a lot of time sometimes go trough sleepless nights. Even trying to walk trough out the day isn’t enough I wonder what’s the minimum amount of time that you work exercise and just pass out I need to know the magic number lol
NotSignal	So, i was recovering from an unhealthy sleep schedule and i thought i was doing well until i came across a pretty annoying problem. I manage to get a solid 5-7 hour sleep but then i can't maintain a healthy sleep shcedule, my body tends to go back to the old schedule.Even with healthy amounts of sleep i tend to feel very sleepy pretty early.Does anybody else have this problem? If so, do you have any ideas on how to fix it?
Signal	The first night I took ambien, it didn't work that well, but I gave it another chance with a positive attitude and i slept amazingly. Last night I considered trying to go to bed naturally but then I thought maybe I was just getting a little too cocky. Like I get one night of sleep and I think I'm cured lol I thought if I did that and didn't sleep well, then I'd be discouraged and go down another panic spiral. So I took my ambien and boom slept. I'm hoping my the end of my prescription, my nosy will have regulated itself. I'm scared itll be become dependent on it but I'll find out next weekend lol
Signal	I'm currently 23, and I work shift work. However, I've had sleeping issues ever since my early teens. I've been working shift work (12hr shifts from 4 to 4.) for about 2 years now, but only recently has my sleeping gotten significantly worse. Doctors can't seem to figure out what's wrong, so I've just about given up. But this is getting out of hand. I feel like I am literally sleeping my life away. Recent example, I got off of work yesterday at 4pm, got home, took a shower, and went to bed at 5:30pm... I am off today, so I slept until 1pm, and I am still extremely tired and cranky. I am still currently laying in bed watching TV because I have absolutely no energy to get up and do anything. When working, I get around 6hrs of sleep. On most off days, I normally get atleast 12hrs of sleep, then occasionally I have days like today where I get 16+hrs and still have to force myself to get up.My body naturally seems to like being nocturnal. I am still tired, but I do feel more rested when I work nights, and when I am off for more than just a couple of days, it only takes a day or two before I am staying up until 5am and sleeping until 4pm every day.I know I wake up multiple times when sleeping, on average 2 or 3 times to go to the bathroom, and quiet often I get waken up by a dog barking. I am generally a light sleeper, however, I am usually so tired I can go right back to sleep. When I'm off, I usually struggle to go to sleep at night, probably because I get 12hr+ of sleep.I'm just so tired of dealing with this now. I feel like I have no life besides work and sleep. It's hard enough to form relationships when being a shift worker. Even more so when you sleep as much as I do or are to tired to do anything when you are awake. I feel like I never get anything done. It"a quiet depressing.
Signal	So..normally, up until about two weeks ago, I was capable of proper sleep... 12 or more hours if I was overworked and overly tired. Suddenly that changed and I'm not sure what happened. It started off as those types of sleeps where you lie in bed, eyes closed the whole time... and then it was morning. It was the strangest thing...time passed quickly as if i had slept. I felt rested, but hardly. But I could never recall any actual sleep state, total consciousness. Fast forward to days later.. Can seem to sleep if I'm very tired. But only for two to four hours. It seems to be getting gradually worse. It seems to be a pattern of 24-32 hours of wake time, during which I have an exhausting 12 hour factory job. I drive home tired after 20 hours minimum.. so tired that my hands will fall off of my steering wheel forcing me back into reality. But then I get home, lay down and sleep. 3 hours later, I wake up. I feel well rested mentally but physically shitty. The well rested feeling lasts about the same duration as the sleep did, then back to feeling like dog shit. I got home from a long day and actually going to a concert and having a great time and wearing myself out pretty majorly. Very tired. I found myself falling asleep at about 230 am. It is 448 as I write this post. Is this how it starts? Will it get worse???
NotSignal	I miss you when I can’t sleepIt’s so much easier sharing a bed with youBecause when I’m with you and I can’t fall asleep, instead of thrashing and rolling and sighing and reading and podcasting and smoking and crying, I can look at you in the dark and listen to your breath and feel your chest rise and fallI love falling asleep to your steady breathing (And the occasional snore)I love studying your features in the cold blue dim that comes when my eyes adjust to the black of the dark roomI love tracing your profile against the dark down from your forehead to the dip above your eyes to the point of your nose down to your chinWhen you’re not with me I can hardly close my eyes. I stare up at the ceiling into the black until it turns blueThen I look at nothing, or I thrash and roll and sigh and read and podcast and smoke and cry. But when you’re with me I look at you. And it helps.
Signal	I'm 22 years old and randomly since last month, my sleep schedule has gotten very messed up. Before this I used a be a very sound sleeper, I could sleep in any situation with noise and lights and whatnot. On weekends id stay up till 4-5 am and after that I'd get right back into my normal schedule of falling asleep at 12-1. But ever since a particular weekend last month where I stayed up late, my sleep cycle has been completely messed up. I am no longer able to fall asleep on time, and there have been three days in the past 2 weeks where I got no sleep the entire night and felt extremely tired the whole day but come next night again I couldn't fall asleep. This is getting me really frustrated at myself because I feel I can't sleep because of the very fact that I'm thinking about whether I'll be able to sleep all the time. And now I just get so pissed off that even when I actually start feeling sleepy at night at say 4-5am I just tell myself "fuck you brain, you don't do what I want, I'm not gonna do what you want" and I then actively try to not fall asleep. I know it sounds incredibly stupid, but I'm quite frustrated and have no idea what to do. I haven't been able to get in touch with a doctor yet because I work 6 days a week and around 10-12 hours each day which leaves me with no time unless I take a leave, plus I'm afraid about visiting a doctor with corona going around anyways. And I'm also afraid of sleeping pills addiction (I haven't taken anything yet though).I just want to go back to how I was, sleep wise, around 2-3 months ago.
Signal	Switched over from Ambien to Lunesta a couple weeks ago and found myself in a bit of a funk. Have y’all ever experienced this before? I’m not sure if this is what is causing it, but I’m certainly not feeling myself during the day. Just no energy, bland mood. Thank you!
Signal	I take a 1.5mg lunesta and a bunch of supplements. Sleep for three hours then have to take a 3mg lunesta and some klonipon and I’m still up. Been up for three and half hours now I really need sleep
NotSignal	Hey I have pretty bad insomnia But when I ever I soak in the Tub I fall a sleep.I don’t know if this is safe but I would think it is as it likely my mind acting weird and the tub being shallow enough not too worry about drowning.So anyone else do this
NotSignal	So I have this cool app: Migraine Buddy. I'm using it to help figure out what's causing my migraines because my parents won't take me to an actual doctor for any of my problems 🙃. Anyways, it is a really good sleep recorder. I now have about two weeks of sleep logged in it and it is very interesting and useful information for me to look at. Now, I'm lucky, I generally get about 7 hours of sleep every night and honestly I am greatful for that, but the sleep is such poor sleep it feels like about 5 hours of actual sleep that is helpful. I'm getting off track :p so I found that every Monday I only get about 5 hours where the other days it's 7 or more. I don't feel stressed to go to school the next day, but it must be a sub consious stress. How can I get more sleep? I'm dying in first period rn trying not to sleep.
NotSignal	I can't try sleeping pills because of my asthma medication so i am trying out different things. Any advice would be great :)
NotSignal	Trying to fall asleep is like working and putting in energy. Throughout the night it feels like you are trying to accomplish something but cannot. Also it is like a battle against your brain which is like your boss at work.
NotSignal	But the day after I'm just fucked dude. Like it's 6:41 here.Anyone tipse for getting over the anxiety?
Signal	One mentality can change everything.I used to not care as much about sleep, often staying up late on purpose. Though not a good habit, I didn't worry at all and was generally always happy and healthy. My attitude then was: Sleep makes me feel good. My attitude now is: I need sleep to survive. And by this mentality changing, this has essentially caused my insomnia to worsen and cause immense anxiety. Now, HOW DO I CHANGE THIS MENTALITY?
Signal	In many sleep time restriction programs it is advised to get out of bed if one cannot sleep, idea being that spending time awake in bed enforces bad habits. I've determined that 6,5 hours would be a good initial sleep time for me for the first week, so I go to bed 22:30, and my alarm clock is set to 5AM, because that's the ideal time for me.The problem is that I still wake up around 3AM. That sucks, because if I get out of the bed, there's not enough time to get back to bed before 5AM. So far I've have just stayed in bed for \~15 minutes and woke up, having something like 4,5 hours of solid sleep time a night. It's tough.... What would you do?
Signal	This will be long, so please bear with me. I have been struggling with sleep for as long as I can remember, but it’s only getting worse for the past 8 months or so. I can’t sleep for over 2-4 hours. Once I wake up it’s extremely difficult for me to go back to sleep, though I fall asleep at night easily. I go to bed by 11pm, wake up at 2am for peeing, wake up at 4am to pee again and then I can’t fall back asleep at all. I’ll share a bit about myself before asking for suggestions to help you understand the problem better.I’m quite sure that I suffer from ADHD and depression atleast; can’t afford psychological counselling since I live in a third world country and there’s absolutely no one I can turn to. Lately, the noise has been too much to bear — neighbours arguing, the stomping from above, street traffic, barking dogs and shrieking kids. It’s been all too overwhelming. Being quarantined isn’t helping it either. I live in a poor neighbourhood with houses just inches apart from each other and needless to say, I’m broke and jobless so moving somewhere else is not an option.I’ve tried everything within my limit, read the books, taken the pills, tried noise cancelling earplugs, tried cognitive ways like yoga, exercise, blue light, warm milk, hot shower, sleep restriction, no phone/tv screen two hours before bed, you name it, but none of them worked. It seems like I’m way past the stage of self-help.Career, hobbies and ambitions are a far cry, I can’t even do daily chores without feeling like my mind is melting. I’m tired of being tired.Sleep was the only thing that somewhat held it all together, and I’ve lost that too. If this goes on, I’m might end up losing every bit of sanity that’s left. Apologies for the incoherent rambling, poor formatting and grammatical errors; English isn’t my first language and my brain isn’t functioning all too well. tl,dr: suffering from sleep maintenance insomnia, tried everything that I possibly could but nothing works.
NotSignal	I don't know if i've actually gotten sleep in the last 2 days due to stress/anxiety. Im worried that im getting dangerously little sleep, feels like Im almost dead. Can just closing your eyes and relaxing replenish my vigor to some degree? something like 1hours of rest = 10 minutes of actual sleep?
Signal	I sleep twice a day, around 9am and 4pm(sometimes only once a day). Has anyone had this problem before? I find it difficult to sleep for for long hours and I feel like I'm destroying my health both physically and mentally. I'm a 3rd yr college student with online classes and I'm so stressed with everything right now.
Signal	My sleep schedule was already fucked by quarantine even after trying to reset it. Last night I couldn't sleep at all after taking my medication. I was able to fall asleep at 9 am until 2:40 PM but that fucks my schedule even more. What should I do? My psych symptoms get worse from sleep deprivation. My insomnia comes in "episodes" usually every three years where for a month I cannot sleep at all no matter what I do and it's a living hell. Ironically, I usually have hypersomnia where I sleep 10-12 hours a night excluding naps. The last time this happened I had a psychotic break (only delusions no hallucinations).What should I do to fix this to prevent another episode from happening? I am currently on Wellbutrin and my dose was upped; should I stop taking it? Meds don't work as I took 175 mg of Hydroxzine then Propranolol when that didn't work. CBD, cannabis, and diazapam don't work either.
Signal	I’ve had chronic insomnia since i was a child but it always occurred in episodes that lasted a couple of weeks where i couldn’t sleep and then things went back to normal. For the past 4 months i haven’t been able to sleep any earlier than 4 am no matter what i did. When the lockdown started i decided to try and fix this for the 108393 time through every method i’ve ever came across. Finally for the past 2 nights i’ve managed to get myself to sleep before 2am, but for only 4 hours... in total... across 48 hours. What’s some tips do you suggest to try and get me to sleep a bit more at least ? I am tired of witnessing sunrises everyday. I already cut my caffein to 0, i dont nap, i try to be active during the day for 1-2 hours and my room is freezing and completely dark.
Signal	I’ve been having bad insomnia for a month or so now and it seems to be worsening at the moment. Well last night I stayed up all night because I just couldn’t sleep or get comfortable. Then I went to work today. So I was up for a straight 36 hours. My lady came home and I wanted to cuddle with her. I knew it was a mistake. But I couldn’t help it and I ended up passing out for 2 hours. Now it is 9:16pm and I’m afraid I just screwed my self for the night even though I know 2 hours doesn’t even remotely fix the 36+ hour stretch of no sleep. Just have bad anxiety about it now and I’m afraid I won’t sleep again tonight because of the nap ☹️😞
Signal	I have a patient that has been on xanax for over 10 years, but doesn't appear to build a tolerance. Are those people very rare in the insomnia world?
Signal	I know that there is no miracle pill that will make me fall asleep instantly, and its more of having a routine and having good habits in order to have better sleeping cycles in the long run. Im currently 17 years old, I exercise for about 2 hours each day, I eat pretty healthy, and at night I stop using my devices about an hour prior to sleep. This has been my routine for the past 5 months now, and it has not had any positive impact on my sleep. To visualize the problem a bit more, I have done countless all nighters because I simply cant sleep, and then the next day even though my body is tired, I am once again struggling to find sleep until I finally pass out at 5 am. I have tried hot showers before sleep, sleeping pills, meditations, hot beverages, heck even some wine before bed, and even smoking a little bit of weed to hopefully feel relaxed and fall asleep (yes I know im only 17) but nothing has worked. My mind is always racing with random useless thoughts, which makes me feel really stressed since I know its not helping, other times these thoughts make me feel very anxious that I have to stop trying to fall asleep and just watch a movie or something. It feels like my life is falling apart quite literally since I can barely function throughout the day.
NotSignal	Hi everyone As per the title of my post has sleep restriction helped anyone here overcome the difficulty of waking up too early before your alarm?
Signal	I seriously cant sleep at all this is ridiculous..i feel like im getting worse and worse anytime i lay down I just lay there unable to fall asleep been happening alot now how can i ask my doctor to test me for this
Signal	My doctor prescribed me 3.75mg pills of Zopiclone.I tried 1 pill of 3.75mg as prescribed yesterday. It has absolutely no effect on me. It still look me until 5-6am to fall asleep.So tonight I took 2 of these pills. 7.5mg zopiclone. It did make me feel a little drowsy, but not enough to fall asleep.It's now 4am and I'm well awake.So tomorrow I want to try 3 pills. That's 11.25mg. I'm a little concerned about it since it's 3 times thr prescription.But I also want to be able to sleep.
Signal	Just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this. I am a heavy drinker (which is a separate issue in itself), and also a borderline insomniac. However for me the problem isn’t waking up in the middle of the night like it is most people. For me, I struggle to get to sleep in the first place, even after drinking. What i think has happened is my tolerance has grown to the point where the sedative effects of alcohol wear off so quickly that they no longer send me to sleep. (If that makes sense?) Alcohol no longer knocks me out like it used to - instead I’ll be drunk/tipsy and tired for a few hours, but then as soon as I go to bed the alcohol wears off and I become overly wired and awake. Its a really horrible feeling. This is when I have my worst bouts of insomnia. I struggle to sleep with or without booze, but I’ve noticed its much, much harder on days when I drink. The only exception would be the occasional days where I’m so shitfaced that I just instantly hit the pillow and crash. Anyone else had this experience? Because to be honest I’m very sick of spending so much time feeling exhausted and I’m trying to work out if alcohol is the cause... (Btw I’m writing this at 5.30 am. The suns risen and I’ve given up trying to sleep tonight.)
NotSignal	Hi all ,Are you people familiar with these horrible jolts of terror ? When ever i try to fall asleep which is alrdy very poor atm (3/4 hours ) it feels i am electrocuted and my heart stands still and this very weird sinking Sensation . Its so bad some Times i even scream and sit straight up in my bed . How can i lessen these episodes ? Its not ignorable for me .Greetz ,
NotSignal	My Dad let me borrow his FitBit so I could keep track of my heart rate while I sleep. At this point I'm willing to look at it at any angle.Well it's been two nights and I've been over 90 bpm the whole time I'm asleep, over 50% of which was over 100 bpm.So I'm not a heart specialist, but I'm pretty sure I should at least drop under my day "at rest" rate (96 bpm)Anyway, no fucking wonder I don't have a restful night.
Signal	Genuinely fucking tired of not being able to sleep. I've tried every trick in the book. I have a warm shower before bed, I eat moderately before sleeping hours, I work out to make sure I'm exhausted, I eat healthy, yet after 2-3 hours I'm in my bed fucking lying there wasting time getting no sleep, then waking up late or tired the next morning. It's so fucking annoying I genuinely considered suicide because I can't live like this. It's so shitty, so painful, so stupid, I'd write every negative word for it if I had the strength to, but guess what it's 1 fucking am and I went to bed at fucking 10pm. I can't grow taller or repair my muscles if I don't get any sleep, so my work outs go to waste. I could use the time I spend doing fucking nothing in bed to study, since I have final exams this year. It's so much wasted time it makes me want to slit my throat and go to fucking hell. Please help, is there some strong medicine that can either put me to sleep quickly or put me to sleep forever? Can't fucking live with this shit anymore
Signal	This doesn’t happen that often anymore. But knowing I had to get up at 4:30am brought me here. So excited to take on the day with 2 hours of sleep. Worst part about this sleeping arrangement is not being able to take any meds or melatonin, since it would make me feel worse in the morning. I actually did take melatonin at 10:30. It put me to sleep but doesn’t help the waking up part.
Signal	Since quarantine started, I Jorge that my sleep schedule has been messed up. I can no longer sleep at night like I normally would, and I end up sleeping at 5 am and wake up at 12. It’s really difficult for me to try to sleep normally because my anxiety kicks in and my heart feels like it could stop when I try to fall asleep. I don’t want to sleep late anymore because I know it’ll affect my health deeply (am 21).What are some things you guys recommend that could make me fall asleep?
NotSignal	What I am about to talk about is called many different things.. and are slightly different. There is the AIP diet.. the elimination diet.. candida diet. I originally did this research to help my daughter who is suffering from inflammation. Long story short.. when you take antibiotics it kills the bacteria in the gut.. but not the yeast (candida).. If you eat simple carbs/ sugar it feeds the yeast and the yeast links up and forms into a plant like structure that forms roots that puncture your stomach. This and gluten (wheat protein) /cassein ( milk protein ) are sticky like glue.. it sticks to the walls of the gut and dissolves it almost to make more holes. This is called leaky gut. Once you have this foods you eat go directly into your blood stream. The body thinks they are foreign invaders and produce antibodies (igg). Eventually the body does not understand why the antibodies are not working and the pathogens continue streaming in the blood. As a result the body go full nuclear and expands the operation of the antibodies that eventually lead to self attack aka autoimmune. I started her on the diet and did it with her for support. I have been on this diet for 4 weeks now. I have been on sleeping pills for over 2 decades. I have slept well the past week without any medication. It is my belief ( although not enough time has passed to confirm this will last.. but for me it is unbelievable the amount of sleep I am getting without meds ) that insomnia might be caused by leaky gut as well. Perhaps it effects the brain more than the rest of the body. If you would like to understand the science behind this better get the book "The autoimmune solution" by Dr. Amy Myers. If anyone was planning on giving it a try please let me know how it goes to further my understanding. It took 3 weeks to begin working for me. If I were to guess it might take up to 90 days for some with extreme gut problems. The diet is very restricting.
Signal	I'm 28. I lift weights three days a week. I walk a few hours a week on top of that. I get sunlight. I eat a lot of vegetables, no caffeine after 12 p.m. I sleep with a blindfold + blackout curtains, so light isn't the issue. I get home from work at 11:05 p.m. and I'm in bed by 11:15 p.m. I wake up at 7 a.m. The blackout curtains and blindfold helped me for a month, then the problems returned. I wake up to go pee, which I think is normal, and then have trouble falling back asleep and then when I do fall back asleep, I'm up again, and I'm usually awake for an hour or more. I don't know what to do. I don't want to take meds. This is messing up my life. I either sleep late, or I end up waking up at 7 a.m. tired as hell because I slept for a few hours. Any ideas?
NotSignal	In total in the past two days i got nine hours of sleep and i sttarted school at 7am. Yesterday i ended at 3pm and today im ending at 5pm. Im falling asleep in my seat. Any advice on how to wake myself up a little? Caffeine barely works on me anymore
NotSignal	Context: Last night, I hung out with friends and had a glass of red wine and a beer at around 11:00PM. Fell asleep on their couch from 12 to 1, my partner drove us home around 2:00. Got ready for sleep, but couldn't fall asleep until 4:00. Kept getting jolted up awake and microsleeping, did the alcohol cause this?!
Signal	Tonight, I turned off all electronics by 8 pm. Drank some Sleepy time tea... took my prescription meds, and laid in darkness for 3 hours.... still up. I listened to sleep music for an hour, still up... I give up. This is destroying my life. I can’t remember the last time I had a full 8 hours of sleep, hell if I get 14 hours in a week then it’s a good week. I am tired all the time. And I don’t even want to think about what this is doing to my health...
Signal	Due to bipolar and anxiety disorders I have periods of horrible insomnia. When I've been desperate for sleep I've loved using Natural Vitality Calm: Calmful Sleep powder. It's a magnesium supplement with melatonin, L-Theanine, and Gaba. Magnesium regulates melatonin so even if I've taken this supplement every night for days during an episode, I'm still able to sleep just as well the first night I don't take it. I've used Benzos and trazadone for sleep and neither has worked for me as well as this magnesium supplement. I also get anxiety at night, especially if I'm worried about not sleeping, and it does wonders to calm me down in the moment. All without the nasty side effects prescription sleep aids can bring. I promise this isn't an advertisement but I've seen a lot of people singing the praises of magnesium in this sub, so I wanted to share my own success with it :)
NotSignal	Did I fall asleep?Did I sleep and just don’t remember?29F, 5’6, 180 lbs, don’t smoke or drinkSo lately I’ve been having trouble sleeping because I’ve had a “shaking” or “vibrating” feeling in the back of my neck and head but last night something weird happened. I remember having the tv on and my laptop open next to me while laying down and then all of sudden I sit up straight, looked at the tv, and it looked like it was glitching (it wasn’t.) Then I looked at the time and two hours had gone by and I couldn’t remember what happened in those two hours. Did I fall asleep and didn’t know it? I don’t remember having a “waking up” feeling so I was very confused. Has anyone else experienced this? Where you’re all of a sudden conscious with no recollection of losing consciousness? Is this due to insomnia?
NotSignal	I'm wondering if anyone here has direct experience with curing or significantly improving their own sleep maintenance insomnia/frequent awakenings/fragmented sleep?If so what did you do that helped?Thanks
NotSignal	is it possible for clonazepam to stop working even though I have only been taking it for a little over a month?
NotSignal	If so, how were the results? Did it improve your quality of sleep and how much you were sleeping?If I can get a solid 7 hours then I might cut out ambien completely and take a risk and do it
NotSignal	I've been able to sleep now with no problem for about a week but it seems like I'm having a sleepless night again. Feels kinda shitty, everyone's asleep and I'm alone and bored, someone tell me anything mildly interesting? How are you?
Signal	I can never fall asleep when I want cus I'm never tired enough and it's really annoying. Recently I've only been falling asleep at around 4 am only to wake up between 7 and 9. Even then naps don't help. It's really fucking frustrating
NotSignal	Only at night at day time I feel in touch with reality, Could it be from an underlying illness I have a runny nose. In addition I’m sweating a lot in the forehead area does that means that it’s healing? Could it be the cause
NotSignal	WHO. WHERE. I know no one like that. NO ONE.My mother has said this one to me so many times, i felt like i was going to pull all my hair out.Just give up and be exhausted??? Never! Im ganna win this battle 😤 *inhales cheese and cherries*
NotSignal	If you’ve tried melatonin, warm milk, working out, getting enough sunlight, eating healthy, cutting sugar from your diet, tea before bed, sleep hygiene, reading before bed, no screen before bed then ask your doctor if offingyourself if right for you! Don’t hesitate to call 1800 off yourself today and get your prescription so you can finally sleep forever!Side effects may include - loss of appetite, loss of vision, loss of taste, loss of body movements, heart failure, liver failure, kidney faliure, and loss of life. CALL NOW!
NotSignal	So I've got work in like five hours first day too I've got a 9 hour shift and can't sleep any advice on how to sleep I'm off tomorrow tho so that's good
NotSignal	I have worrying thoughts and hypnic jerk. I’ve been in bed and can’t sleep for three hours.
NotSignal	6 hours isn't ideal, but it's not a small amount either, but I feel terrible. Is this normal? I commonly sleep between 5.5 and 6.5 hours and always feel pretty bad on these days.
Signal	The doctor is trying to keep me clear of benzo's (she weened me off the klonopin) and has put me on doxepin. I'm just curious if any of you have had a similar negative reaction to mine, or if its all in my head. Symptoms - Vivid Nightmares- Irritability - nocturnal snacking- powerful hang over effect. I had a similar experience on remeron. I have great success with sedative hyponotics "z-drugs such as ambien) but my psyche refuses to prescribe them for more than a few weeks. Other unsuccessful treatments i've tried are Trazadone (no effect) Temzeapan (successful in the beginning but quickly built tolerance)Amitriptyline (limited effect, moderate nightmares) Seroquel (successful but I couldn't handle the night eating)Any thing I should suggest to the doc that has worked for you in the past would be appreciated. The doctor has recommended I get my medical marijuana card, but i'm already not a fan of THC, and the process of getting card is expensive, and I don't make the kind of money to utilize pot nightly as a medication. Thank you very much for any advice or suggestion.
Signal	I am tired and want more than anything just to snuggle down and fall asleep but I know if I go lie down in bed, I'll just lie there for hours bored and frustrated like I have the past two nights.
Signal	I’m such a light sleeper. It’s a new habit that’s been happening for a long while. Okay so when I’m sleeping for the night, I sleep easily. I think I might have difficulty sleeping so to prevent that I try to wake up early and make myself tired and sleep kind of late and sometimes take flu pills that make you drowsy. I end up sleeping quickly. BUT if any noise happens I wake up. Sometimes calling my name wakes me up. My mom was 3 rooms and a corridor away and she called my name out twice or trice. That’s all it took to wake me up. When I wake up I can’t sleep again. I’ve been trying to have a better lifestyle recently and trying to sleep early but it’s hard when you’re a light sleeper and have the noisiest siblings ever. Please, if you know why tell me, and if you’ve got any solutions and experience please share them with me. Thank you in advance...
NotSignal	I'm trying to figure out whether my fatigue is sleep quality related or not. I'm unsure because sometimes I'm not consciously aware of having disrupted sleep yet still feel fatigued the next day.One peculiar thing about this fatigue is that it can be muscled through - if I get physically active or do something interesting, I can forget about it for a while. The moment I slow sown and lie down, I realize how exhausted my body feels.Has anyone noticed a similar pattern?
NotSignal	It's currently 4AM where I am right now, and I can't sleep a wink. I used to sleep like a baby from around 1AM to 8AM back in the US (EST). My new time zone is 9.5 hours ahead. The night I flew here, I had to pull an all nighter in an airport and as soon as I came here I was submerged in my remote college classes that usually end by 1AM. I can lie in bed all night just thinking about how much time I'm wasting. I manage to sleep around 6 hours during the day though.
Signal	And if so, how do you feel about it? I’m slowly coming to terms with the fact that I will probably never sleep without some sort of assistance again. And it seems that as time goes on that assistance needs to be prescription grade. I’m just terrified that a day is going to come when o can’t get a prescription filled and I’ll just be awake forever. Do any of y’all find it impossible to sleep without a prescription pill?
NotSignal	There is a women’s day sale coming up and Idk which one to buy to treat my insomnia...
Signal	I’ve been battling insomnia for the past 6 months. Trazodone hasn’t helped all that much. My doc suggested seroquil, but when I went to pick it up, the pharmacist suggested I try elavil first, since it has far fewer risks than seroquil. Any experience with elavil?I’ve been taking 50 mg trazodone for the past 4 months, and 100 mg for the past week, still with little success. If my doc prescribed elavil, can i just switch them out or do I need to do some sort of taper?
Signal	So i think i have insomnia I’ve had bad sleep all my life, and I have to lay in bed for 3 hours to fall asleep. Sometimes I panick becouse I think I’m not gonna wake up and now I’ve slept 8 hours the past 46 house and I feel so FUCKING depressed
Signal	Usually when I have noticed when I take take break I will fall asleep really late for two hours maybe.I usually fell asleep for like 4 hours and more after a long walk then sleep again for 3.5 hours, I woke up today after like 3.5 hours but I’m wide awake can’t go back to sleep and I’m not tired at all.
NotSignal	Slept only 2 hours last night and feel terrible, but what's the terrible feeling all about? I expected my blood pressure and heart rate to be high because I feel like I'm practically on death's door, but BP is 124/80 and HR around 80. I'm shaky and weak and it feels like when you get a fever, but there's no fever.
Signal	I'm 30, I've had insomnia on and off since about age 23, at times it has really taken a toll on my mind. Its been acting up again so I sought out this group, I can tell from a cursory examination that there are no easy answers or magic pills coming up. Want to know what has worked for me? Weed. Just 1-2 puffs a night and I sleep like a baby. This has been a godsend for me for the last few years, but now I am trying to get a new job and have quit for a few days, the insomnia has come back STRONG. Anyone out there using something that fits these criteria: I WILL NOT USE Benzodiazapines (highly addictive, been there) Antihistamines (cause brain shrinkage long term, look it up, but hey insomnia is probably more damaging) Opiates (again, highly addictive, not an option) Xcore antipsychotics (naw) &#x200B;Im pretty picky, and yes, I am mostly looking for drugs to replace pot. I already do everything else. Daily exercise, no blue light 1-2 hrs bedtime, meditation, eating healthy and not too late, I try to speak my mind and ease my stress, but I am finding that without the weed, nothing is a sure thing. Last night I was exhausted, and convinced I would fall right asleep, I did not sleep one wink. I am trying to stay positive but the prospect of staying off the pot for a month has really got me down. &#x200B;BTW- I get just about 0 negative effects when I keep the dose of weed low, 1-4 puffs a night, I sleep like a baby, and feel refreshed in the am. This is how Ive lived the last few years of my life, which have been some of my best, most productive, and most creative, for those of you searching... pot can help. &#x200B;Any advice is appreciated, and I appreciate the community.
Signal	Im pretty sure I have insomnia at this point, I always sleep really really late,be it a holiday the next day or not. It's almost like I'm constantly living with a jet lag. Thing is, that time when everyone's slept nd u r the only one, that's when all kinds of thoughts hit my mind, and on a daily basis. I get so anxious thinking about everything from stuff about politics, the world, sports, to how I'm a miserable person who'll always be alone. And it never gets better. And then when the sun rays just start hitting and you realise u still haven't slept.....that's when another kind of anxiety hits you. Man now my entire day is ruined, I won't be able to get stuff done,how do I plan my day now.....aah!!!! It's a vicious cycle. I can't escape it, it's killing me.
Signal	for the past two days ive slept horribly. first night when i went to my bed i just couldn't get sleep. i dont remember clearly but i think that i rolled around in my bed maybe 6 hours until clock was 7am. then i got sleep but everytime i was dreaming it lasted only 30 to 60 minutes. i drifted off from sleep to being awake until clock was 12am. and the worst part is that the same thing happened last night. I got sleep at 5am but my dreams ended in 30-60 minutes. can anyone relate? and if can maybe a little help would be nice. i'm starting to get anxious that i have fatal insomnia. i have health anxiety so thats why i get so easily scared.
NotSignal	Watch the video in the comments section of this thread seeing as you can't post video links on reddit threads. This is basically what most threads on this subreddit are :P Gintama is a great anime btw would recommend to anyone, it gets really funny. I just want some good sleep..... this has been me with antipsychotics because my psych refuses to give anything else.
Signal	The worst symptoms always starts around day 4 whenever I have bouts of insomnia. I should be used to it by now, but it's still always horrible. I'm normally anxious, anyway, but now it's on overdrive and I've been having PTSD episodes/panic attacks, especially at night. I just feel terrified and I have this awful, gnawing sense of dread. It feels like something terrible is about to happen. I keep thinking that I'm gojkng to have a heart attack or a seizure or something. I seem to fixate on every single horrible thought, like "what if there's a fire and I can'tt get to the cats?" or "what if mom falls down the stairs, and I don't find out until morning and she's hurt and trapped there all night?" I'd have thoughts like that normally, but nojw it's like I feel *absolutely certain* that it's *going* to happen and I just panic.I haven't taken my Adderall in 3 days, since I don't like taking it when I haven't slept for obvious reasons but that means that the TBI which the adderall normally treats is going untreated. So I'm having some additional speech and memory problems beyond what the sleep deprivation would normally cause. I'm also starting to have mild auditojry hallucinations -- I can hear muffled voices nearby but there's definitely no rational explanation -- and I keep seeing shadows/movement in my periphery, all of which just makes me feel even more stressed out. I'm so fucking tired. But I'm at that point now where I almosyt feel too tired to sleep. It's like the sleep deprivation creates so much added discomfort, anxiety, and distracting mental stimuli that it just gets harder and harder to fall asleep. Like every neuron in my brain is just constantly sputtering, but none of them are firing quite right; my brain is working *a lot,* but it's not working *well.*...on the bright side, I should be getting a refill on my xanax this Thursday, which will definitely help me sleep. Unfortunately that means I won't be able to get it for another 38 hours or so, and I really, *really* don't want to be awake that much longer. Once the psychosis starts, it escalates pretty fast and I don't want to imagine what tomorrow could be like. If I'm lucky I'll get some sleep before then and I can just save the Xanax for my next bout of insommnia... hopefully that's where this is headed.Idk if I really have a point to any of this, I just needed to vent a little bit because I can't do much of anything else rn. Send sleepy thoughts.
NotSignal	0 hours of sleep going into a 10 hour shift....FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuuuuuuuUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Signal	Hello everyone, new to the sleep problems. I’m sleeping from 11 to maybe 4-6. I’m waking up a lot with racing heart and hunger pangs. The worse part is the day time sleepiness. Does anyone else have that? How did you deal with it? It tends to get better closer to night time interestingly. I need to get my anxiety under control but the sleepiness during the day is exhausting. Just want better sleep.
NotSignal	I need help. My boyfriend lost his job because of the pandemic then got kicked off his insurance because he's now unemployed. He had to go off of all of his medication that kept him stable and helped him sleep. He hasn't been able to sleep for more than maybe an hour in 3 days. I've tried everything I can to help but I'm at a loss and he's starting to lose it from frustration and lack of sleep.
Signal	Before this my sleep cycle was pretty consistent, I was getting on average 7-8 hours a night now I’m lucky to get 3, it’s definitely anxiety induced and the more I worry about not sleeping the less sleep I get. And now I feel like I’m getting other symptoms: loss of appetite, ear ache, dry throat. Is this common or am I just sick in general?
NotSignal	Schnookerdookers! This quarantaine got me back into my old army routine. Sleep 2 hours be up for 1. I know this mighy sound like i'm getting a lot of sleep. But there is no actual resting involved. I kust stay awake until my eyes actually close from exhaustion. And then I wake up as soon as the eye muscles got energy for another round.Didgeradoodle, my mind really needs a break!
Signal	I'm in the UK. My GP finally referred me to cognitive sleep therapy so I'm currently signed up to an NHS programme called Sleepstation. After a week of filling out diaries they've now given me the following routine for the next 2 weeks: **I need to be in bed at 2.30am and out of bed at 7.30am.** This gives me a **maximum of 5 hours sleep.** Considering it takes me at least 1-2 hours to fall asleep I'll be getting a maximum of 3-4 hours sleep per night for the next 2 weeks. For reference, before I started this programme on average I get 5 hours of sleep per night. I know this is a lot compared to a lot of people on this subreddit who get 2 hours of sleep per night but I need 8 hours of sleep to function as a human being so I suffer from concentration, mood, motivation and memory issues everyday as a result of my sleep. Sometimes (maybe once every 10 days) I get lucky and get almost 7 hours of sleep and I'm actually a bit happier and able to concentrate on my tasks a bit more on those days.I definitely think I can stick with this schedule without napping through the day but I have one concern. Like many of you here I struggle with depression. I'm 100% sure my depression is caused by my insomnia and not the other way around. I've had sleeping problems pretty much my whole life. I think I came out of the womb with sleep problems so it definitely wasn't a case of me developing depression and then getting insomnia as a result. On days where I get less sleep my depression is a lot worse. If I go a few days on 3 hours of sleep the suicidal thoughts re-appear. How am I going to go 2 weeks getting a maximum of 3-4 hours sleep without having an extreme mental health crisis? Has anyone else who also has depression tried sleep restriction? I know the next 2 weeks are going to be extremely dark in terms of mental health and I just want a glimmer of hope that it's going to be worth it in the end.
NotSignal	Hi everyone I’ve been battling insomnia since 2010😴. Ive tried all OTC/supplements/light therapy and CBD products, not much works. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with epilepsy back in 2016, luckily though it is controlled with my medication, Keppra.. I do however wonder if the epilepsy or Keppra aggravate my insomnia more. I do take ambien for nights when sleep is nonexistent and it does work well for me. But my mood has been low for quite sometime and my sleep doctor suggested possibly Trazodone, not only my insomnia but also for my muted mood.. does anyone have experience with Trazodone working well for their insomnia.. any input is always appreciated.. thanks so much 💜
Signal	So I’m out of sleeping pills and have been for about 3 or 4 days and I just can’t find the money to get more. I’ll be trying to go to sleep at 10pm and I’m lucky if I’m even close by 4am. Was up until 8am this morning. It’s making it harder to focus on fixing my mental health when I spend half my time infuriated about being so exhausted yet wide awake.Just needed to vent. Thank you.
Signal	I'm actually in a hospital now, on sleeping meds that knock me out, and I'll wake up only 1-2 times at night. I sleep almost 10 hours and wake up exhausted af. This is incredibly weird, maybe my sleep architecture is disturbed, regardless of whether I notice anything or not?Has anyone else been in this situation? If so, what helped?
NotSignal	Meaning you take it - but you don’t go to sleep - you force yourself to stay awake. I’ve done it 3 or 4 times in the 2 weeks or so I’ve been on it. I have zero clue how I can do this. Also I have had horrible acid reflux since starting it. Wondering if anyone else has this.
Signal	Hey there! Verging on month 20 of nightly insomnia and looking for tips to sustain good academic performance. Initially, I would crawl into bed for upwards of 12 hours a day, not expending any energy and cinching just 2 hours of sleep per night. I've improved immensely over the months and am now averaging 5.5 hours. However, I haven't observed a marked difference in my cognition or spirits--on less than 7 hours of sleep, I'm functionally drunk and am given to rumination and histrionic fits. Trazodone was effective, but my focus and memory was even more diminished than when chronically undersleeping. Consistency helps a bit in accumulating sleep drive, but I can't maintain sleep past 5 hours or so, unless very ill. I'm at a top-10 university that really, is a bit underwhelming in its expectations (relative to what I had anticipated), but nonetheless my performance is lackluster (objectively, I did well and am on track, but I know I could've done better under different circumstances and that destroys me). Considering I now work in a lab 12 hours a week and am the chairperson of a few student organizations, I'm entrenched in responsibilities that are above the threshold of my current potential. I'm only a month into my second semester, but the first midterm gauntlet is approaching and I feel ill-equipped and on the verge of failure, as I always am due to being functionally drunk. I miss my competent self. I've struggled with severe mental health issues since age 8 and grew up in a home with mentally ill and abusive family members. My dream is to become a psychiatrist and scientist through an MD-PhD program but I feel that's unattainable for someone like me. I've worked so hard to develop the resilience to make it to this point in life but it all feels for naught. I thought I tempered my mental health issues well enough but clearly they're emerging in sleep, even if I generally feel "fine". Is it possible for me to become who and what I want to be, assuming no improvement in sleep? If I muster what's needed to work instead of sulking and whining, will events unfold more favorably? Anyways, I digressed a lot. Any tips for performing well in a scholastic environment when sleep deprived? Thank you to anyone who skimmed over this.
Signal	I’ve gone 72 hours without sleeping and I thought I was physically dying but I felt so high and euphoric lol
Signal	It all started a few months ago, because I worried myself about something not even about sleep ever since then I struggle to sleep. I have not managed more than 7 hours a night for 3-4 months, while it is interrupted. I have severe anxiety and it never played into bedtime strangely, until now. It completely crushed the joy out of living and enjoying life.I’ve tried mediation, SRT, ambien, melatonin, trazodone, & countless other tricks and aids. Even if I do sleep, I still get a massive headache in the morning and my eyes feel like they’re about to pop out. I’ve talked to my doctor multiple times. Nothing is working.Whatever I had anxiety about before prior to insomnia makes me laugh and seem so tiny, I took life for granted. You never know until it hits you.You stare at the ceiling, and you look at your partner and family and without any sleep troubles sound asleep. The loneliness is powerful and excruciating, and the only way I can manage a few hours of sleep is getting close to my partner and snuggling up close to get her and accepting my inevitable demise and crying silently and accepting it for what it is and realizing despite only 21 years of life I made great memories.Sure, I might sound overdramatic but the hopelessness is real. The pain is real. The fear of dying is real.
NotSignal	Most nights I don’t get to bed until 5-9 am. It’s been like this for two weeks now. What is going on with me? I usually wake up in the middle of the night or get only a few hours of sleep but this is ridiculous...
Signal	My issues started in 2017.College/home life was not good. My mental state was in a havoc. I started eating fast food, started eating when i was emotionally stressed/studying/etc. I started delaying college work and sleep by staying awake playing video games to not be stressed about life.This lead to more stress and anxiety. I only became productive last minute, which lead to me pulling multiple allnighters. In a span of a week.All this absolutely destroyed my health and I developed sleep anxiety and ultimately insomnia. I.e. fear of not having enough time to sleep led to racing thoughts at night that didnt let me sleep a wink.Once i lay in bed for 8 hours and didnt get a wink of sleep. All this took 2 years to reverse. To reverse sleep anxiety and poor health. Through rigorous mindf thinking and making the right decisions with my eating and sleeping habits. I was slowly able to achieve restf sleep.Now I can fall asleep within 15-30 minutes max. I wake up once night to pee and yet doze off immediately.The solution. a lifestyle change. It takes 1 step to complete a 10,000 steps. I thought I was forever a slave to my insomnia, which lasted 3 years after it began.
NotSignal	TLDR; I fasted for two weeks (only water). After week 1, I could sleep.I've been struggling with insomnia for 4 years now. I have had it mostly under control using one form of THC or another. However, I began to suspect that this was making my eyes dry which I had been struggling with for awhile too (This assessment turned out to be wrong) and I was at my wits end with the insomnia. Relying on THC for sleep doesn't mesh well with traveling to other states and countries which I really enjoy / need to do from time to time. Thus, I decided to try a long-term water fast.Not taking anything to help me sleep meant that I was a wreck for many days. It took a whole week, but I persisted. After just about one week, I got my first nights decent sleep. OMG was that welcome. Then I slept every night for a whole week, and had one bad nights sleep at the end of that, but I've slept solid ever since. It's been two / three weeks now if great sleep every night. I know it's a short period, but I thought I'd share the progress here anyway.I have read many books on fasting, but I recommend _Joel Fuhrman, M.D. - Fasting and Eating for Health: A Medical Doctor’s Program for Conquering Disease_ above all as it's so incredibly loaded with references and so well researched. Fasting isn't for everyone, and it's recommended not to do a long-term fast without doctor supervision. I hope this is of use to someone and gives hope. Sleeping without any aid whatsoever is a huge relief for me.
Signal	This is currently my 3rd night while sleeping less than 3 hours, and I slowly am going insane.School legit just started up for me, and well, for the most part it's been a living hell. I cannot for the life of me get myself to sleep on time. I've had this problem my entire life, but right now during the summer it's gotten to a point where I can't bear it anymore. During summer, some nights I tried to sleep at 1am and only ended up dozing off by 7am despite being up for countless hours. Right now, I tried to sleep at 10pm and only got to sleep by 3am, but this is not doable in the long run because I need to be up for school at 6am and I feel like eventually my mental health is going to break even further after some time, right when I need it the most.When I try to sleep I either get completely stupid-ass thoughts that don't correlate to anything significant (think: literally songs that are stuck in my head or any random things that happened during the day), which is to be honest starting to make me freak the fuck out because it makes me feel like I have some mental disorder (I only know of anxiety that I have), and other times I just simply CAN'T SLEEP NO MATTER WHAT. I can be dead tired from workout or something physical and still be completely unable.I've tried all these "home remedies", such as no electronics before sleep, drinking some tea, trying to focus on breathing, listening to calming stuff, but it just doesn't help at all.I am not even sure if I'm grossly overreacting or if this is merely a case of extremely fucked up sleep schedule, but of course I want the best for myself, sorry if I am overreacting.To top this all off, I am underage and I live in a country where most sleeping pills are gated behind prescriptions (and they rarely prescribe you them, only if you have papers regarding sleep problems or have an extreme case), and hospitals are literally making you wait literal months for therapy/investigation because of Coronavirus. I really don't know what to do with myself anymore. Sorry for the rant-ish post. I would literally kill for any help for relieving this.
NotSignal	im trying to lose weight but i didnt sleep last night. its 5 am. can i go to the gym today? anyone have any experience working out on NO SLEEP?
NotSignal	I (22f) fall asleep pretty quickly when I go to bed, but I wake up in the middle of every night and lie awake for 2-4 hours, exhausted but unable to go back to sleep. Then I sleep late until I can get 9 total hours of sleep. This has only been going on the past few months, irregularly. But the past three weeks, it's been literally every night. I use caffeine and Wellbutrin every day. Is this just a bad sleep pattern I've fallen into, something that needs to be "trained" away to eliminate the habit?Is this a medication side effect or anxiety symptom? Does it even count as insomnia since it's a new thing?
Signal	Been awake for pretty much 3 days. I fell asleep for exactly 15 minutes 2 times on Sat. This is awful.
Signal	I’ve been taking valerian extract to help me with sleep anxiety and just found out that I’m among those that gets excitability, uneasiness and overall jumpy as a side effect, if i don’t immediately fall asleep after getting drowsy from valerian, anxiety gets the best of me and every noise and thought or outside input feels like a threat. Any tips related to easing sleep anxiety are welcomed.
Signal	I feel like lack of sleep is making me lose interest in the things that I used to love doing. I don’t read books anymore, can’t seem to sit through any movie. I even gave up singing. Nothing seems worth the effort anymore. Does anyone else feel the same? How are you coping?
NotSignal	I have a lot of trouble sleeping, but I don’t know if it’s insomnia or if its because I’m lazy during the day.
Signal	Hello everyone - I’m looking for success stories/recommendations for a light box that I can use during the day at work. I work in a dungeon and it’s really throwing off my sleep schedule (I’ve coined it ‘enterprise syndrome’) - insomnia has been slowing taking over for the last 3 weeks after having it mostly under control for 1.5 years. I already have an appt with my meds management person to discuss. I stopped clonidine like 4 months ago for sleep bc it was spiking my blood pressure (when I didn’t take it). So I don’t have anything to take at the moment. Thanks for any recommendations!!
Signal	Slight imposter syndrome posting on this sub after only 2 weeks of sleeping problems, but last week I thought 4/5 hours sleep a night was bad enough. Tonight I've been trying to sleep for 5 hours with no luck and at this point it's not even worth it anymore, my alarm goes off in a few hours for work. Really looking forward to trying to function on zero hours sleep!Weirdly don't feel tired at all yet, what's the betting that by 9am when work starts I'll be nodding off?No advice or anything necessarily needed, but welcome if you have any (drugs background: I took 3mg melatonin the last 2 nights which helped a lot, but didn't take it tonight thinking I should ween myself off, what a mistake). I mainly wanted to post for this momentous occasion, and to remind everyone out there awake rn that you're not alone! Wish you all a restful night and a good day tomorrow :)
NotSignal	So I’ve managed to take back control of my sleep in a lot of situations, which is an amazing feeling after 20+ years of issues. My next obstacle is figuring out what to do with timing and my partner. For the most part she is asleep much earlier than me - which frustrates but is manageable.However when she stays up late and I wanna crash (uncommon but it happens), I get stuck - I know that when she comes into bed it’ll wake me up and I’ll not be able to go to sleep. At the same time, if I can actually get an early night once in a while I think it’s be amazing.Any suggestions? Right now I basically just force myself to stay awake until she goes to bed too. Not ideal...
NotSignal	When you take a nap earlier, and pay for it later. As you lay in bed, watching the clock counting the hours until you have to wake up for work, knowing you’ll never fall asleep.
NotSignal	Anyone tried this? It's supposed to help you relax as sleep so I got it from Amazon. But my first night didn't see any diff! Carl
NotSignal	I’m starting to think that I really don’t need the 6-8 hrs of sleep that I’ve always been striving for. The stress of meeting these expectations has caused me to just feel more anxious over time. I have a lot of nights where I don’t even sleep at all and to be honest I’m not dead in the water the morning after. I can still function. Just made this post for people like me who roll around I bed and progressively get more nervous as the night goes on. I’m here for you man.
Signal	For about 3 months I used sleeping pills (rotating between Restoril and Zopiclone) on and off. I knew deep down that this was merely masking my insomnia and not addressing the main issue. I realized also that I was causing long term health problems for a short term "fix". However I have gone pill free for nearly a month now and have no intentions of going back.What I did was kind of unorthodox, but if I can reach someone with this post who's in the same situation, then I will be really happy:Ultimately the answer was regaining confidence in my sleeping abilities and sleep drive. Also the method I did is counter intuitive to the existing academic techniques and literature out there, as it makes you go to bed EARLIER, as opposed to later, but it worked for me and it might for you:1. Sleep hygiene is super important. About 2 hours before my predetermined bed time, I would stop all electronics. I would also concentrated on winding my mind down and relaxing.2. I would do at least 30 minutes of light exercise a day (usually a calming walk at sundown) and eat a carb-light dinner no more than 3 hours before bed time.3. I would practice mindfulness and relaxing breathing- concentrating on breathing not with my nose, but originating the breaths from my chest and diaphragm. The nose was just the doorway for the breath and not the origination point- if that makes sense. In other words, the air was just going in and out of my nose while the rhythmic up and down of my diaphragm would drive the breaths. This helped me to relax tremendously.4. Finally. The most important thing I did was told myself I was not going to use any pills that night, but set a time limit 7 hours before I woke up, while going to bed earlier. For example, if I had to get up at 7am, I would wind down by around 10pm. I would go to bed telling myself I have 2 hours to sleep WITHOUT a pill, but should I NEED one, the take one at 12 am at the latest. With this technique I slowly began to rely less and less on the pill, while taking comfort in knowing that it was always there as a plan B.5. Eventually I was able to sleep on my own, as I gained more and more confidence in my sleep drive. After about two weeks or so, with only 1 or 2 days of relapses, I didn't even think about any sleeping pills.TLDR: if you're on pills, have it as a back up. Go to bed 9 or so hours before your scheduled time to give yourself time to wind down. If you're still up 7 hours or so before your wake up time, take a sleeping aid. Slowly develop your sleep drive and confidence, while having the pill only as a back up plan.Note I still use 3mg of melatonin occasionally with some magnesium powder- which to me is FAR better for my health than prescription sleep aids. Hope this helps.
NotSignal	In 3 hours I will have been awake for 24 hours and I also have to get up for school, I'm going to have to go another 8 hours before I get home, is this doable without falling asleep in school?
Signal	Can Insomnia Trigger mental illnes ? I have trouble with my memory, i feel like im going to be crazy. I Have this insomnia trouble for 7 years (20y.o) Its up and down. Shoud I go to doctor ?Can you give me some advice ?
NotSignal	I feel like I’ve gone through multiple prescriptions via my GP and I’ve sneakily taken double doses because of my struggles and nothing seems to work.The only thing that works for me is marijuana and it’s not legal here and i have no idea where to even source it.I’m hoping there’s some super strong drug that will just act like a tranquilliser and knock me out otherwise I’m in for a super shitty life.
NotSignal	After going to the er last night, the doctor gave me ambien. I took it around 240am and knocked out. My dogs woke me up at 7 and I ate and walked them then I pretty much napped on and off until like noon.Obviously taking it at 240 am isn't ideal.But how do I take it properly so that I don't have to be on it for more than a week or two?
Signal	I (23f) feel like having a normal sleep routine has never been easy for me. I find it too easy to stay up until the early hours, and still be able to get up at a reasonable time and go to work. But I had to force myself to go to sleep then, I suffer from anxiety and depression and have done most of my life, so turning my brain off is so difficult. I'm not totally knowledgeable about insomnia itself, if there are different levels and types of it just as there is with anxiety and depression. I just know that it doesn't matter how well, or not well, I sleep the night before, for some reason I can stay up until stupid AM doing fuck all, and not be tired or able to sleep, and that no matter how tired I am, it can sometimes take me hours (no exaggeration) or lying in bed for me to actually fall asleep. Since I've been off work these pasts weeks (how long has it even been ??) My routine has gone out the window. I was productive the first week, then I had a week where I was in pain from injuring my back paired with period pain, and any motivation I had to keep a healthy routine went out the window, along with sleeping at normal times. Most nights I'm usually up until 5am. Sometimes anywhere between that and 9am. Waking up between 2pm and 4pm. My boyfriend works from home and has alarms that go off and wake me up from 8:30-9am. He works 9am - 5am and he's usually what wakes me up at maybe 3pm or something. I tried staying up all night, but had to give up at 7am because I was so tired. I just can't seem to find a way to go to sleep earlier. I tried reducing the time I go to bed by an hour every night so 5am then 4am etc etc which didn't help either. Do I try an all nighter again? Do I just sleep however long and get up at the same time as my boyfriend no matter how tired I am or how much sleep I got? Do I nap in the day if I do that, or not? It's really affecting my mental health quite severely now, as if it wasn't bad enough already. Im not sure what I want to get from posting here. I suppose I just want to put my thoughts somewhere while I can't sleep (nearly 6am now). Any advice is appreciated. I've got the Calm app and regularly try to fall asleep to asmr etc on YouTube but I find having headphones in quite frustrating as I'm a side sleeper. I could have stories on Calm playing aloud from my phone on the nights I used to go to bed at the same time as my boyfriend, he didn't mind the noise and can fall asleep within a minute of lying down. But I feel that if I played them out loud when I come to bed in the middle of the night it would disturb him, so it's not really fair. He's also a very loud snorer so the fact he always falls asleep before me really doesn't help things. If you read this far then you must be as bored and sleep deprived as I am ;)
NotSignal	Probably explains the insane anxiety and panic attacks I have been experiencing over this past year. Also the extreme insomnia where I was up for 3 days once and almost ended up in the ER.I will be treated next week for it and hopefully be back to normal.
NotSignal	i guess, what’s the highest dose of melatonin you can take before getting serious side effects? google has a ton of different answers and i’m kinda desperate cause i’ve built up a tolerance
NotSignal	I know im just ranting but im so sick and tired of hearing people say things that make me sound like im the one doing something wrong when i toss and turn hoping for sleep. Its not like i want to be this way. Don't people think Id LIKE to have a normal sleep routine and get some sleep?I LOVE MY SLEEP. I dream every time i do, i want that! But its hard. Im sick of it. Im cranky as hell and im sick of other people talking like this in my every day life when they don't get it. Sigh.
NotSignal	Pretty much the title. I don’t want to kill myself, I just want to sleep a decent amount of time lol
NotSignal	Looking for some reasoning on why my insomnia is inconsistent. While I’m glad to not be in terrible patterns all the time, I’m curious what causes insomnia to be mild to severe. I’ll sleep as close to normal as possible, then with no warning, I’m up all hours of the night and sleep schedule is non existent. Any ideas/science/experience!!
Signal	This probably does not belong to this sub but I'm really frightened and want to write it somewhere.It was around 4pm when I had finally fallen asleep. Because it has always been difficult falling asleep, I did not get in bed too soon anyway. I was reading Harry Potter right at the table right before tucking myself in.I had dreams of being chased by a very fast moving dog on the street. Faster than a car. Someone sitting at the pavement wearing a hood and had no face, like a dementor? But I shouted at the nonexistent face and woke up. Only, I really hadn't. It was a false awakenings. It wasn't new to me. Not truly aware I looked for my phone in the dream. (Doing something real like scrolling through Reddit brings awareness). Before I could find the phone, I heard my parents voices in the dream as if they were in trouble in the other room. With this, I actually woke up with a startle. I looked for my phone and wrote this. It is all very real now. I have experienced very disturbing false awakenings loops in the past. About 10-15 of them and waking(false) up with someone abusing my body. I'm finally awake and really don't want to sleep. Tldr; Just a false awakening that scared me. No idea if it is related to insomnia.
Signal	I can’t fucking sleep. Every time I drift off my leg twitches! I have been in bed for five hours! I am very tired. What can I do??
Signal	When it comes to things that are suppose to make you drowsy, in my experience they work quite well... however.If I pick up a bottle of melatonin for example. I’ll take like 3 mg the first night and have an okay time getting to sleep. The next night if I just take 3mg, I feel nothing. Same goes for any sort of PM medicine as well as some herbal mixes I have tried. I have never delved into any “hard” sleeping medication as I don’t want to always be relying on medicine. I have to drink alcohol for 5+ hours before it makes me tired and weed (my only real vice) wakes me up as opposed to making me sleepy. I’m not really asking for any advice, however, does anyone else feel the same?
Signal	I cannot sleep. I've always had sleep issues but this is the worst it's ever gotten, the doctors don't know shit and keep throwing medication at me (Trazadone, Gabapentin, Hyroxzine) I've tried all the supplements (magnesium, melatonin, GABA, Valerian Root) and I still cannot get sleep. I don't get any sleep and I'm losing hope, I'm going to a specialist soon but I fear they won't know what to do either. I have restless leg syndrome and salivate too much at night, but even when these things are under control I still have a very hard time shutting down, I get over 40 minutes of cardio per day but it doesn't help. I don't know what to do
NotSignal	It is the middle of the night her on the Pacific Coast. I am definitely far from sleep so I am finally binging GOT (I know... late to the game). Who else out there is awake right now. Where are you NOT sleeping at? What are you doing to pass the time?
Signal	I am currently experiencing a periodic bout of insomnia. I haven't slept for just over 11 days. This isn't my longest bout yet, which was 16 3/4 days (Just over 400 hours). According to the internet, the longest known bout of insomnia is 11 days (264 hours). I have passed this many times, and is the last thing I want. Going without sleep for this amount of time is extremely unpleasant for me. I don't think it's healthy to be continually conscious for more than 2 or 3 days.I am desperate to sleep. I have tried sleeping pills in the past and searched/tried suggested remedies from the internet, all to no avail.I am desperate for even a little sleep. As usual, since the 7th day without sleep, I have an ache throughout my whole brain which gets worse every day, i'm exhausted and am experiencing some quite disturbing hallucinations. Strangely though, contrary to supposed expert advice on the internet, my mental faculties are still sharp. Even when I can sleep, it can hours for this to happen. I find sleep really elusive. My brother can put his head on the pillow and will usually fall asleep within one or two minutes. I really wish I had this "Superpower" because that is what falling asleep easily is to me.If anyone has similar problems getting to sleep after days of insomnia and has discovered a way to fall asleep, I would be really grateful if you could let me know how.Many thanks
NotSignal	Now that I got ya hooked, it’s time to cut the bullshit. No one here has fucking insomnia. It’s a made up illness so idiots who spent all their time on phones and games and expose themselves to light at night and stay up drinking energy drinks and sodas can use it as an excuse. You’re body will literally force you to sleep if you get too tired. Stop whining and shut the electronics off, and before you ask if I’m a boomer, I’m not. I’m 23. Buncha crybabies making excuses. Quit using beds to play on phones and stay the fuck away from them. Use them only for sleep and you’re body will let you sleep ya pathetic people!
Signal	I already know the root cause of my insomnia but I feel like I would need more support. Right now, I have enough money to pay for one but the only thing that keeps me from contacting one is because i’m afraid i’ll pay a huge amount of money so someone would tell myself to practice breathing exercises, meditation and sleep hygiene (which I already do) . I’m already on Zopiclone and it’s not that effective anymore. I really want to tapper it off and would prefer not to be on any other meds cause I can get addicted fast., Thanks!
Signal	Looking for a sleeping aid that will actually work. I’ve tried nearly everything from intense workouts to physically tire myself, melatonin and L-Theanine, all sorts of herbal teas and herbal supplements, relaxation techniques, and going electronic free before bed. The only thing I haven’t tried is legitimate prescription pills because to be honest they scare me. Should I just suck it up and get some? Are they worth it? Or is there any other options
NotSignal	So currently I'm in a new relationship with a guy, and that gave me sleep problems and it happened to me multiple times over the years I really don't know if it's anxiety or just the nervousness of seeing him the other day cuz I don't wanna make any mistakes you know what I mean? I really don't wanna go on meds or anything I asked my friends if I should just stay single cuz not getting enough sleep is obviously not healthy and they were about to proper chop my head off, also I'm bad at being alone so that's not an option Any help is appreciated ♡♡♡
Signal	I’m 15, I’ve had insomnia for most of my life. After a couple years I was finally able to try clonidine and it worked great, the only problem is that now I’ve built a tolerance for it. I don’t know what else to do, I’ve tried melatonin in the past but it gives me nightmares so bad that I wake up. I also have chronic fatigue and between that and the insomnia I can’t function. I just need help.
NotSignal	I started having this weird sensation a couple months ago where I am about to fall asleep, however I can feel as if my arms and legs are getting "heavy" so I have a urge to move them.... and the minute I move them I wake myself up from my sleepiness and I end up tossing and turning for the rest of the night. Anybody else ever experience this?
Signal	I wont have access to ambien after the end of August. What I am planning to do is take Ambien and listing to sleep hypnosis to fall asleep the month of August. I am hoping it will condition my brain to associate hypnosis with sleep. Do you think this could be possible? If not, what are things your recommend.I have suffer from chronic insomnia since childhood, I am a now 45. Ambien is the only thing that has helped and now they are taking it away from. I don't know what to do? I have tried a lot of OTC from stuff that I can buy in store to "medication" that I have to special order from specialist stores
Signal	So, I’ve had insomnia for as long as I can remember. I’m 30 now, and for about the last ten years, drinking alcohol helped me fall asleep. Well, I recently became sober, so sleep has once again become a huge challenge. I didn’t always drink EVERY night, but definitely on nights when my boyfriend was on vacation and I was home alone. He has been out of town recently, and now that I’m sober, I’m at a complete loss of what to do. I know this sounds crazy and codependent but that’s not what it is. I have this recurring dream that is so unbelievably vivid, that someone is breaking into our house. Usually (if I’m not having sleep paralysis) I jump up next to him in bed, or wake up crying or screaming and he calms me down. He won’t be back until late next weeks and I just don’t feel that sense of safety right now. Since he’s been out of town and I’ve been sober, I have this irrational fear that someone is outside the door, like every little sound is SOMETHING. So now I have to stay awake till the sun comes up, because that feels safe to me. I am aware that this is definitely anxiety related, I was just wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar and how to find ways to overcome it that don’t require me to rely on any substance to force myself to sleep. Thanks in advance!
NotSignal	After another night of no sleep, I'm going to use this to my advantage to start a new schedule that will make me more productive during the day and get to sleep at night1. Wake up at 8:30am, no matter what2. Fruit for breakfast3. Joe Wicks Workout at 9am4. Wim Hof Breathing Techniques to recover 5. 4 Minute Cold Shower6. Try to do some schoolwork7. Have a long walk8. Have a healthy lunch9. Relax in the afternoon, doing activities I enjoy10. Switch all electronics off by 8:30pm11. More Wim Hof Breathing12. Hot Bath & Hot Chocolate13. More Wim Hof Breathing14. 2 Hours Reading15. Sleep.
NotSignal	Calm down naturally, if not, then do meditation, or listen to some music or other audios like a light, gentle reading/broadcast that helps people to have a nice deep sleep. Be more confident (may need training) will reduce anxiety.
NotSignal	when trying to sleep I get a combination of hypnic jerks and every few seconds this dreadful sinking anxiety feeling in my chest. today I was doing some yoga and during the end of the video where you just lay down on the floor, i closed my eyes and started deep breathing, got that same sinking feeling i get when trying to go to sleep. trying not to pathologize too much but I am really frustrated. yoga is the only activity that i kinda like right now and it was just so uncomfortable to experience those symptoms in "my safe yoga place." talking to my regular doctor today and psyc. doc next week, we'll see what happens.
NotSignal	For like the past 4 or 5 days I have been pretty wired. I have a headache and my eyes hurt. When I crash, its for like 4 hours max and I'm up for 12 hours or so.. I can't do the math.. Its been hard to think. Usually I'm groggy all day but recently it's quite different.
NotSignal	They literally won’t stop. As soon as I start to fall asleep I start twitching and get jolted awake. FUCKING STOP
Signal	So... for the past 3 nights ive had some heart palpitations. Nothing huge like a sudden spike in heart rate but just the big THUMP THUMP THUMP thats very noticable. Every time im super close to falling asleep and my breathing slows down. My heart slows down considerably. Like to the point to where my head feels super dizzy then i get huge sweats despite it being very cold.Im too scared im gonna die. Im very sleep deprived now. I have one last medication i can take but whose to say ill be alive after i fall asleep.I feel utterly shit. 26 male.
NotSignal	I haven’t slept in 2 days & now i feel like im finally gonna fall asleep but i dont want to i wanna stay up i feel like something’s gonna happen if i do.
Signal	Ahh my head is exploding. All I want is to go to bed. I slept from 5:30 pm-8 pm which is an entire nights sleep for me. Devastated, in for a long night. Let’s start off with 20 mg of melatonin, sleep pills and an Advil pm!
NotSignal	I remember a piece of that dream/trip then I found my self wide awake I’m going to lost it what is happening
NotSignal	It’s 5am. I’ve been up since 2. I’m extremely sick and very lonely ( the people I thought cared about me are ignoring me). My medication usually knocks me out but I’m so anxious that I’m laying here in bed shaking. Any advise?
NotSignal	I have had lack of sleep recently insomnia is a bitch when you have not slept for a day and decide to go out clubbing with friends things can get spooky alcohol makes me have nightmares I slept for like 1 hour in a hotel with friends I finally get to sleep and I look up at there is a man with scratched out eyes and a big grinning smile looking at me I woke up from my sleep really confused and spooked but I had to go my advice is don’t let insomnia beat you staying up is crazy can give you permanent brain damage try and get as much sleep as you can thanks for reading
Signal	Last night I went to bed around 12, and it took me 3 hours to fall asleep because I kept thinking about when I'd fall asleep, and being paranoid about bodily symptoms didn't help. Mostly, I was just super aware of my conscious state and that prevented me from going to sleep. I even had taken cbd and 6 mg of melatonin and still couldn't sleep. It seemed like anytime I was about to drift off, I would become aware again and the cycle would continue. Any of you experience this and what do you do to prevent this?
Signal	I am honestly just so done. Apparently their sleep specialist is only in 1 day a month, so I spent $70 for the pulmonologist to rule out sleep apnea (which I could've told you it's not) so that I could be put on their list for the sleep doctor. Now I get to miss more work and pay another copay just to see the doc I need.I've been brushing off sleep referrals for a decade because I've never been able to afford it. I'm in a little better place now so I finally made the appointment. I was so excited to finally talk to an expert about my lifelong sleep issues that have just gotten worse as I've aged. I don't know if there's anything they can even do for me, but I've tried just about everything and am really losing hope. I just feel defeated.
Signal	I've realized that I'm probably misunderstood. It seems like many of you guys are craving the ''sleepy'' feeling. Unlike you, I get sleepy at a decent time (lets say 10pm) but my anxious mind keeps me awake. When I say that OTC meds (like diphenhydramine) don't work on me, it's not that I don't feel their effects. It actually increases my sleepy feeling and makes it go through my entire body. But, no matter what dosage I take, I will never fall asleep & stay asleep if my mind is anxious (about sleep of course). Just wanted to clarify and maybe see if other people here feel the same, has the same problem.
Signal	It’s late. I am exhausted, but I can’t sleep. I feel feverish and my body aches.  I took my blood pressure and it wad 163/126. I feel like shit.... and I still can’t sleep.
Signal	My doctor told me I have delayed sleep. I go to bed around 9 but dont fall into a deep sleep until 1 or 2am. I then sleep until 10, 11, or 12. It is impossible for me to get up in the morning. I feel that's when I get my deepest sleep. When I do force myself to get up at 8 or 9 I end up falling back asleep. Even when I was working in an office I would go out to my car and sleep for 20 minutes in the morning because I was soo exhausted. No matter how early I go to bed.. i just cant get up in the mornings.I'm not sure where to start with getting myself up I'm the morning. I want to be in work at 830 but I end up sleeping until 10 or 11 on the weekdays and having to work late or take PTO. help! Any advice is appreciated. I'm already taking melatonin 5mg at dinner time.I should also mention that I'm on remeron and geodon. I dont sleep at all without meds.... dont give me advice on getting off meds. I've been an insomniac my whole life and meds are the only thing that have ever given me some relief. I take my med around 7 so I'm not taking them too late
Signal	Woke up at 2:40am Despite this normally making me very depressed and hopeless, I think I might get a sleep screening or schedule oneI might try cutting ambien completely and do sleep restrictive therapyI probably need ADHD meds or anxiety medsI’m currently unmedicated for both despite diagnosisI’m feeling strangely hopeful despite the worst circumstances
NotSignal	I started getting this sort of motion sickness feeling and I sure as hell haven’t been going anywhere. It started after a 2 day visit to my folks house where I got zero sleep in two days (versus the couple hours I get at home) and it’s a week later and I still feel it. I’m wondering if anyone feels this weird fog accompanied by light dizziness.
Signal	Just a little rant you don’t gotta read it I just wanna write this down. So how the fuck can the rest of the world just lay their fucking heads down and pass out but ME? Nope nuh uh no sleep for you bud not today. It’s fucking bullshit that I can’t sleep and IT CANT BE THAT FUCKING HARD TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FUCKING SLEEP. Awake at fucking 5 in the morning and it’s ridiculous and then I have to fall asleep and waste the day away or pull an all nighter and if I can’t go to sleep the next night??? Well buddy your shit fuck out of luck, round two bitch hope your ready. It pisses me off the only thing that helps me go to sleep is weed but guess what? FUCKING ILLEGAL and what’s even better? Oh yeah! I get drug tested! So fucking off goes my sleep schedule and my fucking routine I’ve been working on since this COVID BULLSHIT STARTED. Also you know what else is great? Sleep. You know what I’m not getting? You guessed it! FUCKING SLEEP. Wanna get a scrip for your insomnia/anxiety/whateverthefuck? “No you’ll be fine, you just have to get up and be more active!” Fucking does that work? Nah I DON’T FUCKING THINK IT DOES. So, I can’t smoke to sleep, can’t get a scrip, what the fuck am I spost to do? Drink myself into a fucking coma? Cause that’s the point where I’m fucking at I fucking hate it and I fucking hate myself for not being able to do something so goddamn simple. Thanks for coming to my fucking Ted Talk.TL;DR : Fucking bullshit.
NotSignal	I’m trying to improve my sleep and was wondering what is the device used by most to track sleep quality (REM, deep sleep, etc) as well as quantity (time of sleep)?I’ve heard of Oura ring, Apple Watch and Fitbit. What are the pros and cons of each?
Signal	Hey. For the past month my sleep schedule has started getting off, originally starting with me being unable to fall asleep before 3 AM when before I had fallen asleep at 12 AM just fine until it got staggeringly worse. As of these last three weeks though my sleep has gotten drastically worse with my bedtime now being Noon and my wake up time being anywhere from 4 PM to 10 PM. These two days (today July 13, yesterday the 12th) I’ve slept 4 hours and I don’t feel tired in the slightest but I want to sleep so bad just to give my brain a rest.The only medicine I’m taking regularly I’ve been on a steady dose for the past year and there have been no recent changes in mood or situation that would cause me anxiety or grief that would keep me up. I only drink caffeinated drinks on the rare occasion when I need to focus which hasn’t been since March. I’ve never been diagnosed with a sleeping disorder but I’ve always had trouble sleeping and recently it’s just been so much worse. I have no clue what’s causing this and it’s starting to become a tad detrimental to my social life and my hobbies. Any help is good help, thanks for reading.
NotSignal	I didn’t sleep like usual but I also had to get up because I left something at work even though I didn’t have to work today. Yesterday I said wasn’t going to smoke. But since I couldn’t sleep, yesterday never ended. So the craving stayed. I broke and bought a pack... I’m just sitting here trying not to move so I don’t want to smoke... still not tired :/ lol at least everything’s funny when I don’t sleep
Signal	Really bad insomnia the past couple of weeks. It’s been on and off past 4 years. Trying different prescription medicine and CBT and not working. Really bad headache that won’t go away. Ugh
NotSignal	I screwed up my day today by starting to drink beer at around 6 PM and then had a continuous hukkah session for like 5 hours straight, watched 3 movies while doing so. My sleep schedule has always been so fucked up, like 6 AM or 7 AM is my normal bed time these days, but today it's worse. Being around all the smoke is making me so anxious and usually I get tired enough at 6 to close my eyes. Today, I can't even do that. I hate myself so much for today.
NotSignal	tl;dr: I need a weighted blanket to sleep. But I have a hard time getting it ON me. I am an adult female, weighing 180 lbs. I got a 12 lbs blanket (I tried 20 lbs and that was too heavy).I tried to use a Duvet Cover on the blanket to help keep it clean, but I can't get the ties to keep the blanket spread out. So then it bunches up, and I can't get it smooth out to lie under. Any advice? Thank you!
Signal	I slept a full 8 hours last night only waking up twice, and I feel like I got hit by a bus. I feel like I'm exhausted, I could close my eyes right now and fall back asleep. Even now just trying to type this out every blink is making my keyboard blurry because my eyes want to shut so bad. My body is so achy and heavy, I wish I could go and lay back down but I have work today. Worst part is, if I sleep like crap the way I usually do (3-4 hours, waking up 5-6 times a night) I feel just as bad! Stomach pains, chills, awful, awful fatigue... I don't think I'll ever wake up feeling satisfied and refreshed ever again...
Signal	Meds are 4 days late and annoyed because I literally can NOT SLEEP with out them. Here marks 24 hrs. Luckily I had spares to last the other 3 days I guess. Been a few months since Iv felt like this, not sure what to do with myself atm so making this post.
NotSignal	Beside the fact that when I wake up, I'm tired AF, I'm also experiencing second winds. What I mean by that is: I'm tired all day, but when it starts to get dark, I'm suddenly extremely awake.This also lead me to have a fucked up sleeping schedule. I even tried to stay awake all night and go to sleep the next day's evening in order to take control, but even if I was comatose the whole time, the moment the sun outside started to go down, I was again awake. It didn't matter that I was sleep deprived at all. I can now sleep only during the day. It's ok with the lockdowns, but for when things will cool off, I need to fix this : S. What the hell is happening? lol
NotSignal	This is my first ever post on reddit so please excuse my formatting. Right now i've pretty much given up on trying to fall asleep which is also why i'm posting this here. I've got several problems with my sleep:As the title already says i kind of fall asleep but wake up 20 minutes later and feel completely awake and fit. After this i struggle really hard with falling asleep again since i just don't feel tired anymore. A lot of times these kind of naps are followed by an extreme acceleration of my heartbeat which relaxes after a few seconds. It's like i got jumpscared by falling asleep. When i try to sleep afterwards it feels like every single nerve in my body is itching and i just want to go for a run (I already heard of Restless Leg Syndrome and am taking magnesium to counter it).Besides that i really don't have a good sleep anyways, i wake up regularly during the night like 5 to 7 times and sometimes it's hard to fall asleep again immediately. I have had these issues for as long as i can remember but in the last few weeks it has become worse and i can't fall asleep every second day. The only thing i found for myself is doing lots of sports but honestly i can't do sports every day just to fall asleep and also i already have a physically demanding job (mailman). I've tried avoiding screens 1 hour before going to bed but it doesnt help. I basically feel like i only got one shot at falling asleep or else i will stay up the whole night no matter how tired i am. Any advice would be welcome but i think talking about it also helps in a way.
NotSignal	I can normally get to sleep relatively ok but I keep waking up due to feeling really hot, almost to the point of sweating. The room itself isn’t that warm. I try using fans and opening the windows etc. all good but at some point I always wake up super hot and unable to get proper sleep :(Just wondered if anyone else has experienced anything like this
Signal	Often when I wake up after a couple hours of sleep my brain is wired awake and jumping all over the place, my foot is tapping and I feel like I could get up and go for a jog. As I try to relax and get back to sleep it's like my senses become heightened and every little thing around me drives me crazy and I can't tune it out. For example the sound of my partner breathing next to me - I always try to just accept it and fall asleep to it but it genuinely makes me heart clench and race! I've worn ear plugs for as long as I can remember, but recently I'm starting to hear noises from wearing those like a slight crackling soind once they've been in for a bit and warm up, it's driving me insane because I know it's such an insignificant noise that wouldn't bother most people, but my stupid brain can't stop focusing on it and it makes me wide awake. I've tried loads of different white noises (apps/Spotify etc) but even they start to bug me as I start hearing repetitive loops in them (so I can kind of hear the time passing) or I straight up start hallucinating voices (like a radio talk show?!) which is apparently quite common according to Reddit lol. At this point I can only sleep alone in the second bedroom where I don't need to wear earplugs (still dependant on if I'm having a generally bad/good insomnia spout), but I don't want to get used to this as I would obviously prefer to be able to simply sleep next to my boyfriend! My only solution for this at the moment is taking myself to our spare room and popping a couple nytol tablets or zopliclone and reading a book until my eyes physically can't stay open, but I always loose way too many hours a night of sleep. Does anyone else experience this? Or have any advice on how to overcome this?
Signal	I’ve had limited success with Zaleplon and initiating sleep, which is my whole problem. If I can’t sleep I won’t, until I physically fall over from exhaustion. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to sleep. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times for depression and anxiety, I’ve gone through the hoops of CBT and DBT therapies. I’ve done all the holistic options as well. My sleep hygiene is great and I am still left with chronic insomnia. I’ve tried Anti-psychotics, which wear off effectiveness after a week. Also, z-drugs like ambien, lunesta and I’ve tried Temazepam, which works sometimes, but leaves me feeling exhausted on top of my already excessive daytime sleepiness. And anti-depressants like mirtazapine and trazodone. Nothing has worked properly, I’m thinking my insomnia is severe enough to warrant a medication for severe insomnia. I just did a sleep study, it took me about 7 hours to fall asleep. Should I ask for triazolam and if so how should I go about doing so.
Signal	Hi, I've come to the sub to try to answer this question because I'm not entirely sure if I can call this Insomnia or if I'm just "bad at sleeping" I guess?Most of my nights end up with me being awake until 4-5 am trying to sleep, but I do eventually get sleep but I don't wake up until 12pm and I end up dropping back in and out of sleep until 4pm. Which leads me back into staying up until 4am.I've also gotten into the habit of pulling all nighters, whether to try and tire myself to sleep at a regular time or just so I'm not late for Uni at 9am, I usually get a good nights sleep from being sleep deprived but regardless the next day I try to sleep at 10pm/11pm and then just not sleeping until 4am once again.This has been happening for the past few months now and I feel like a regular sleeping pattern is just impossible at this rate, but I'm unsure if this insomnia or not.
Signal	I've been taking low-dose Trazadone nightly for years now. I've also had extreme lethargy and depression since before that, for various reasons. I started to wonder if maybe the Trazadone was exacerbating it. I tried not taking it for one night, and was up until 8am until i took a xanax to sleep. same for the next night. but even though i only slept around 6 hours, I felt much less tired and shitty. what are your experiences with trazadone?
NotSignal	I was sleeping perfectly fine before last night and im scared im not gonna be able to fall asleep tonight
NotSignal	These past few nights (Including this one) When I tried to sleep no thoughts or images would come to my mind, when I layed down on my bed and close my eyes, it was full black. Nothing else. Does anyone experience the same?
Signal	Hi. Its been about a month and a bit where I am unable to sleep. I went “to bed” at 11, and I am still lying awake at 3am. I dont get more than 4hrs of sleep a night. This is not typical for me. I used to be a “sleep queen” - able to fall asleep whenever and wherever. I feel like I am going crazy.Thats all. Just wanted to tell someone because my parents just say “just go to sleep”. Like....no shit. If I could, I would.
Signal	This is just a stupid rant by a 14 year old.Anxiety insomnia keeps on screwing with me all the time. I kept thinking I conquered it, but somehow it just always finds a way to relapse.And everytime I get a relapse, it's a possible chance for it to become chronic and haunt my life forever. Anxiety insomnia is caused by fear, at least for me.The fear of not being able to sleep, causing me to not be able to sleep.But the cause of my fear of not being able to sleep, has two causes, one being the not being able to sleep itself, and the other being school.I'd say I live in quite an expensive country, where things are quite hard to afford considering my mother and I don't have a house, and are squeezing in with 7 people.My mum always told me if I failed my grades, it's the end. There won't be a place for me in this country due to the expenses, I won't be able to live happily due to the lack of money.It's practically almost impossible to afford a house as a waitress if I don't get good grades and get some good office job, because my mum hasn't saved enough for a home even after 20 years of working. She knows this, so she warns me that I HAVE TO get good grades, for a good future where I won't have to suffer due to being poor.But now this stupid anxiety insomnia will make my grades fall to the bottom of the ocean, and potentially cause my whole entire life to be ruined. Not just mine, my mum's too.My aunt and grandmother also put their faith in me to study hard and give my mum at least a happy life after she retires but at this rate I don't think I can do it, even writing this makes me want to cry now.I don't know how to continue living with all this pressure, and I just want to live a normal life without all this anxiety and I want to sleep.I just want to sleep.I've thought about this so many times, I wonder if sleeping forever can be a good solution to end all this pressure and anxiety but that'd just mean abandoning all my responsibilities and everything my family weighs on me.All my friends will be sad if they saw me as someone dear so I can't die.But I don't know how to continue with this, I don't want to fail in life.If anyone who has had a similar experience, or is going through a similar experience, can you please share how you overcome this or how you live with it?It'd seriously be great help.
Signal	it's 5 am right now, I usually lay in bed trying to sleep at 10 pm and need to wake up at 7 pm cause of school. This has been going on for 2-3 years now and I dont know what's wrong. I am 16 , I have talked several times with my parents about it but they dont think it's a big problem "it's just me that doesnt want.to.sleep". I have currently gave up sleeping while reading this, the sun is already up and I can hewett the birds. I really wanna sleep, I'm tired
Signal	I have had insomnia issues off and on for over three years. It started right when I was diagnosed with thyroid disease and was starting antidepressants. Went three days with ZERO sleep and I called my doc crying and he put me on temazopam (sp?) for a month. It helped and I never needed them again. Flash forward to present day (three years later) and I’ve hit another wall. Melatonin used to work for me. It has worked until this past few months. I guess I grew tolerant?I was told to try CBD / Hemp for my insomnia. I don’t smoke marijuana or want to so I figured hemp was my best option as I truly don’t want to be on any more prescriptions if possible...
NotSignal	Lately its been difficult for me to sleep, but recently I'm no long sure if am even sleeping or if I'm just laying in my bed for hours with my eyes closed. Before I cam identity if im sleeping because I can remember I was dreaming. But lately I feel like I'm awake the entire time with my eyes close and semiconscious. I don't know what I can do. Please help me
Signal	Was prescribed with Zopiclone by my GP, after reading some reviews, people seem to have side effects. I need to wake up early for tomorrow and I’ll be doing some heavy physical activity. Would you guys recommend me taking Zopiclone early in the night (8-9pm) or should I use 5htp + magnesium? Thank you!
Signal	Since I got anxiety insomnia, everyday was just tiring, and because I live in an Asian country, I have to get up at 5 am everyday to go to school. I got barely 15 minutes of sleep at times which makes me really exhausted.One of the most impactful thing insomnia had on me was my studies, I wouldn't say I'm a super genius or anything. But most of the time, I never had to try hard in anything, but after my insomnia came, I could barely hold my head up to listen in class, and my eyes stung too.My straight A grades have instantly dropped to C and I kept finding myself absolutely failing at questions I used to find so easy, because I couldn't read the questions properly.So I had to actually start trying hard in my studies, and actually revise unlike usually where I'd play games all day. (Games weren't that fun for me anymore though, insomnia makes it so tiring I can't enjoy anything.)But recently I finally got rid of my anxiety insomnia, and I stopped crying at night trying to sleep, I really hope I don't get a relapse like last time. I realised I kept my habit of revising and all that, and I think in a sense it's actually a good thing even though insomnia is perpetual hell.
Signal	It’s currently 5:29 am. I think I fell asleep at 12:30 but I know I woke up only an hour later and have been awake since. Aaand the night before I didn’t sleep at all either, so this is the second day in a row. I spent the last hour sobbing uncontrollably. Honestly I thought everyone had trouble sleeping and it was just something that came with life until my roommate told me that she’s never been awake for more than 24 hours in her life. I was floored. That happens at least once a week on a good week, averages maybe twice a week and a bad week is three nights of unrest for me. Not fully awake maybe, but not sleeping for more than 4 hours for sure.I don’t know what to do about this, I’m a bit of a hypochondriac so I was hesitant to diagnose myself with anything or research too much but I’m starting to think I have a real problem. Like, this can’t be good for my heart right? Or my brain or anything. Is being constantly sore for no reason a by-product of this or the reason that it’s happening? But then again I truly think I’ve struggled with this my whole life. So anyway... think I gotta call the doc soon :( I just want to sleep (and no, melatonin doesn’t work. NyQuil did last year until I started abusing it)
NotSignal	What are some things I should do before bed that might help me sleep? I've tried a few things but so far nothing has worked. What works for you guys?
NotSignal	Slept well and early the past 2 days until today. Ate a cheeseburger with fríes around 12:30 and its now 2:54 am. I cannot sleep because of my heart beating hard that i feel in my chest. I’m a bit nervous that i won’t be able to sleep tonight. I try not to think about it but it bests hard that eventually i pay attention to it. Anyone go through something similar where their heart beats hard and begin to notice it which then leads to nervousness which also leads to no sleep? I feel like i can control it because i drank tea the past 2 days (and today but unfortunately i can’t sleep) and i fell asleep without thinking about my heart. I guess my uncle who died at age 22 from the dangue disease scared me a bit because he died so young and some family member mention how anxiety can kill you because of stressing your heart out. Can someone clarify if that’s true because that just scared me even more. Anyways, sorry for a long read just texting what’s coming to mind.
Signal	I was doing so good with sleep at 12am and waking up by 10am, then suddenly boom all down the drain.Now I can’t fall asleep till about 5am and the last week I’ve been FORCING myself up by 10am to try to tire myself out to sleep earlier, and some night I only get 2/3 hours of sleep and as soon as nighttime rolls around no matter if I got 1 hour or not I CANT FALL ASLEEP. I don’t know about anyone else but if I don’t sleep atleast 7-9 hours I have zero energy, zero appetite and I feel awful.This past WEEK I’ve probably eaten 1000 calories. I’ve been eating half of a cup of rice because I just don’t get hungry anymore if I don’t sleep. Can anyone relate? Idk how to fix this. I tried Xanax which was great but I don’t wanna get addicted, can’t smoke weed, tried stretching before bed, herbal teas... I’m falling apart
NotSignal	Anyone taken melatonin for sleep to wake up with a headache and major dizziness?
Signal	Just what the title says.... I've been suffering from insomnia for around like 7 years and for me it was caused by mental illness (anorexia, ptsd, depression)...it has gotten better and then worse and better again for quite a while but around a year and a half ago I really started to get a better handle on it, before this pandemic started I would have maybe only one night a month where it would take me more than around 2 hours to fall asleep whereas that used to be the norm. It's very much anxiety based for me, once I start to get anxious about how long it's taking me to fall asleep or what time it is/might be, I am basically too far gone and it just spirals and spirals out of control from there until I will spend whole nights awake just cycling between crying, doing something to calm down trying to get rest, panicking because i still cant sleep, crying, etc.... but luckily that hadn't been happening to me much lately, I was doing pretty okay. Now it's all fucked up again. Before, I had a consistent schedule which helped a lot, in bed by around 11 and awake at around 6:30 or 7. That hasn't really changed, I have been getting in bed at the same time ever since I've been working from home, but for whatever reason I can't fucking sleep. I am trying to do all the stuff that I normally do, follow my normal sleep routine, but it's started to take me longer and longer to fall asleep. I think in the past it might have sort of self corrected once I had to wake up early for work the next day but I'm finding it near impossible to wake up early at home since I will not fall asleep until around 4 am or something and I don't HAVE to get up sine my WFH is not time based whatsoever, I can do my work anytime, and so I end up always sleeping in until later than I should, like 10. I know I should keep trying to get up earlier and that should help, going to bed earlier really doesn't work beause im automatically feeling panicked that I'm in bed early and what if I can't sleep and it will be this many more hours of laying awake, etc, it's anxiety inducing which is quite bad for me... but waking up earlier should hopefully helpbut yeah I guess I know what I should try but I just needed to rant and get this out. It's so frustrating to have this be happening to me again, because like I mentioned it's tied to other illnesses and those get much louder and stronger whenever my insomnia is bad, and vice versa, it's often hard to tell which got worse first. It just feels like a vicious cycle too where the worse my insomnia is the more i am anxious and worry about it which directly feeds it and makes it worse. I'm just so sick of it.
NotSignal	I listen to sleepcasts on the Headspace app. It isn't free but has been so worth it to me. I think you can do a free trial for a week, maybe. Every time I can't sleep, thoughts are racing or I just don't feel sleepy, I put one on and I've never made it to the end of one awake!
Signal	My heart is just racing and my body is jolting me everytime I try to sleep. I am feeling tired and yet I just can't sleep, it's killing me right now. I want to sleep but my anxiety is keeping me from sleeping. I don't know what else to do, it feels like I'm having an anxiety attack right now. I tried breathing in and out slowly and tried just listening to calm music but my brain is refusing to sleep no matter what. I legit don't know what to do. I just sorta started back up with a good sleeping schedule as well. I keep going back to the same habits where I can't sleep at all, only when I am extremely exhausted. It's like I just can't sleep at night no matter how hard I try and I know I'm going to end up staying up all night again because I just can't relax at all. Damn.
Signal	For the past 7 years I have been having progressively worse sleep. even though I sleep. when I sleep, regardless of how many hours I sleep for, it feels extremely non-refreshed and I have like awakenings at night and early morning. but i immediately fall back to sleep. timeline: feb 2013 - I noticed I was slowly losing my ability to feel sleepy. but i could still sleep normal. so I didn't take much thought into it. May 2013 - my sense of sleepiness goes down dramatically. my quality of sleep is like very bad now. I now get early morning awakenings and my mind wakes itself up in the middle of sleep. before this point, I never got any of that. July 2013 - for one random night in this month, i could sleep normally. then the bad sleep went back to usual the night after. don't know why. feb. 2014 - my sleep quality goes down. [Between Feb 2014 to Dec 2018 my sleep stayed the way it did. didn't go up or down]January 2019 - my sleep quality drops down even more dramatically, out of the blue. my ability to feel sleepy also decreases. January 2020 - same thing as before.First week of April 2020 - my sleep is now so bad to the point where I wake up with aching in my head all the time. My vision is blurry all the time and my eyelids twitch. I feel completely non-rested even after 8 hours of sleep. When this happened it didn't happen gradually. it happened like a light switch. one night, everything was normal. then the next night, it just immediately gets worse. I have went to the doctor and my standard blood work is normal. I went to sleep specialist in late-2013 and they said I had light delta waves and more Stage I/II than Stage 3/4 sleep cycles. They ruled out apnea and other respiratory related issues. They said my sleep was physiologically normal, otherwise. Please help me. I have quit school because of how bad it has gone. and, as of April, spend most of my weekends lying in bed because my brain is constantly fatigued from lack of good sleep. I know I should go to another sleep specialist. But can anyone here please give me their two cents on what is wrong with me?
Signal	I've had severe insomnia for the last 8 years. I am now approaching the age where pregnancy seems to making its way into many conversations with my partner. This is obviously making my insomnia even worse due to the anticipation of something making my insomnia even more unbearable. Just the thought of being pregnant, not sleeping, and having to suffer on that train until the baby comes out which then means even MORE insomnia seems actually impossible. The mere thought of this is of course making my insomnia even worse. My question is: is there anyone on this thread that has insomnia and was pregnant at a time? Can you tell me what that was like? Thank you
NotSignal	Hello everyone. I am 20. I have struggled with a bit of insomnia in the past but now it seems to have settled with no sign of leaving. I can connect this to a couple events that happened. Do you remember when you first started not being able to sleep?
Signal	This week was going well, I was getting a decent amount of sleep but tonight has been the worst of the week so far ; I’ve had an episode where I was afraid of falling asleep for some reasons (very irrational) and then told myself that it was all bullshit so I finaly went to bed at 3:00 am tossing and turning cause I was already agitated because of before. Then boom! im falling straight into a Vivid dream that lasted 40 minutes? (according to my fitbit) I’m so shook this has never happened to me before?
Signal	My grandfather has Parkinson. I got triggered one week ago because he is in a medical center and the doctor told us that he almost didn't sleep and was really violent. So my brain did the amazing job of thinking maybe he could carry the gene and now everyone in my family would have it? But now I think it's just me who has it really... My vision got worse in the last couple of days, I can barely sleep, I always feel warm but my back is always with chills, I have body twitches... I'm having a college exam tomorrow and I couldn't even rest because it's already 5 am where I live... I don't know what to do really I need reassurance please
NotSignal	Like, a 24-hour club with cool stuff where we could all suffer with each others' company. Post-vaccine, of course. But wouldn't it be great if you could meet others with your problem and at least kind of socialize and have a bit of fun?
Signal	Long post incoming. So, I've been dealing with insomnia for a little over a year now. It kinda developed during a depressive period after a breakup and just... Stayed. My current 'record' is over 96 hours without a single second of sleep. But. This week... I slept fine Tuesday, only three hours Wednesday, and nothing Thursday evening. Last night, at work, I started hallucinating. Never happened before even on 4+ days. Hearing people calling my voice from across the room, shouting my name in my ear, seeing flashes of light every couple minutes. Whatever, I thought it was fine. Normal insomnia symptom according to everything I've read. then I slept an hour, woke up, and was in a full-on delusion. I was convinced I had been doing my job... In my house. Freaked everyone in the house out. I'm fine with hearing and seeing things if I know they're fake... But delusions are much scarier. So. I'm kinda at a loss. Been avoiding benzos/other heavy sleep aids due to the dependency thing... I hate the idea of being dependent on anything enough to suffer through the insomnia. But... This might be my limit.Kinda needed to rant a little bit, and get some clearer opinions.... still kinda out of it.
Signal	Lately my insomnia has been getting way out of hand and I can’t solve it. I was awake for 44 hours until this morning, when I napped from 8:30 till noon. I’ve been unable to fall back asleep since then and it’s starting to creep towards nighttime and I don’t feel confident that I’ll be able to sleep tonight either. It’s now been almost 54 hours since I got a full nights rest and I’m just so tired.This is kind of a ramble but I would appreciate any suggestions, or even if you wanna rant to me.
Signal	Hello friends , i’m scared i have SFI , and i’ve had periods where i didn’t sleep for a week straight , but recently i was admitted to a psych ward for bad panic attacks and major depression , i’m so scared that i have SFI , but i was hospitalized for having a prolonged QRS , and my heart rate was dropping low , (into the 30’s and 40’s) , but i’ve noticed i have been having a lot of muscle twitches , i’m not sure if it’s because i’m taking new meds (5 mg is buspar twice a day and remeron 15 mg for sleep) , but i was having jerks that would wake me up before i dosed off , luckily they stopped , but i don’t have any significant memory loss or anything , but i’m worried that i do have SFI , because it says involuntary movements , sweating , and anxiety are common symptoms, and i know i’m probably bugging you , but i’m just really scared , i know you aren’t a doctor or anything but there’s always a slim possibility of me having SFI , i’m a 16 year old male 5’8 , 140 lbs , and no one in my family have ever had Fatal Insomnia , i know prion diseases are rare , especially in adolescents, but there’s always that slim possibility, if anyone has ever had an SFI scare please help me out , thanks and everyone take care
Signal	for the past couple weeks i’ve never been able to fall asleep at a good time, as soon as I start falling asleep i’ll have disturbing lucid dreams that sound almost similar to sleep paralysis, except I can wake myself out of it once it starts happening. but it just happens over and over again until i’m too anxious or scared to even sleep at all. I can rarely fall asleep before 4AM
Signal	i’m from the u.k, i’m gonna see a doctor as i can never get enough sleep at night and end up napping after coming back from uni. Even if without a nap and less than 8 hrs of sleep, i struggle to sleep at night until quite late. What medication is usually prescribed? and what are the side effects?
Signal	I really can not predict my sleep schedule sometimes ill fall asleep with no problems but its 2:31 am and the sleep anxiety is kicking in the “what if i die in my sleep” thought is kicking in im really considering taking trazadone even if its 2am what do you guys think i should do
Signal	Hello, so I’ve had this issue on and off to varying degrees over the past year and a half, although recently things have been pretty bad. I’ve been waking up an average of 7-8x a night for about two weeks, each time, as always, having to urinate. I’ve tried all possible remedies over the year and a half: all of the numerous OTC, herbal, and prescription stuff, from anxiety helpers to of course straight up sedatives. Heck, I’ve even tried blacking out on liquor too. My sleep environment is solid, and always has been, I’ve seen two different sleep psychologists over the many months as well. I’m quickly loosing hope, getting suicidal to be honest, and need help. Currently I’m talking one pill of unisom, a normal dosage of melatonin, some bladder support pills, 150mg of trazodone, and 20mg of Prozac nightly. Is there anything any of you guys could suggest me doing that you’ve seen success with? Thanks
NotSignal	First off, I'm not looking for a medical diagnosis or anything like that. Just looking for some background information before I go to a doctor and see what's up (hopefully later on this month).Anyways, I'm looking for some possible ideas of what issue I have. I usually take 45mins-1.5 hours to fall alseep, and when I do, I usually sleep for 9-11 hours. Sometimes it takes up to 3 hours to fall asleep, if I even can (happens roughly 3-4 times a month). Is there a name for something like this, or a list of conditions that have that sort of thing as a symptom? I don't drink coffee after 2pm if I even do, and I use the blue light filter on my phone for a couple hours before I try to sleep.
NotSignal	I'm 21 M from India. If any of you are actually trying to find company of each other just drop a message saying 'me' and others can see and can get connected to you.
Signal	Hi all, hoping everyone is safe during all these insane 2020 events. I wanted to reach out for advice about my partner who experiences insomnia and lately a lot of anxiety/stress.It pains me to see them go through this daily and the lack of sleep isn't helping either. They usually take melatonin before bed and I do everything I can to prevent them from waking up in the middle of the night. Attend to our cats, get them water, make sure the AC remote is next to them and so much more. With someone who doesn't experience insomnia I'm not really helpful in the advice department. I try to understand what they're experiencing and Google some different methods but in the end my partner says nothing has worked. Does anyone have any experience with something that's worked or would have any input on what we should avoid?Thank you for your time and please stay whale 🐋
Signal	Hello, I have had sleeping issues for many years, characterised by1. Decent falling asleep, often stress related if I can't2. Continual awakening, once I wake up, I can't fall back asleep.3. I only sleep 4 hours maximum in a row, then I wake up feeling awake, naturally I get so fatigued towards the latter part of the day because I can't sleep again if I go to bed at a normal time like 11/12.)I'm on 15mg mirtazapine still, it's probably the most effective thing that isn't neurotoxic(ie benzos/zdrugs) among all sleep drugs. Trazodone doesn't work and most others do nothing.)How did I fix it? I adopted a stupid sleeping pattern, I go to bed at 8pm, wake up at 12 or so, do anything I want for 3-4 hours, feel tired again, go back to sleep for till 7/8AM. I split my mirtazapine dose for first/second sleep.Honestly there's decent evidence to humans having naturally biphasic sleep, but I don't really care about quoting studies and whatnot, I'm only saying what's worked from the perspective of an extremely long time sufferer. This sleeping pattern isn't ideal for my social life etc, but it's essential for my sanity. Give it a go if you feel, there's not much to lose.
NotSignal	I’ve been awake for 4 days now. I couldn’t sleep 3 days ago because of pain in my chest, I was kept awake by the pain. That pain has been gone for 2 days and I cannot fall asleep. I laid in bed for 8 hours yesterday. I tried to sleep 5 hours ago and now I’m here. I heard the average person can live for about 11 days without sleep and all I can think of is dying because of that. My heart pounds like a drum and anytime I close my eyes I start to get painfully aware of my own breathing and start to breathe manually until I give up.
Signal	So Ive posted on here before about my insomnia getting more and more extreme for the past few months and my anxiety heightening. I’ve tried the sleep hygiene stuff, its not working. So I have two questions that I hope my fellow insomniacs can give me some insight too:During the day I’m so fucking tired and tense from the lack of sleep, what’s the best way to deal with that so you can hopefully sleep better the following night: do nothing and pamper yourself (ie try to take a nap, read, watch tv etc) or do a lot of activity to tire yourself out (ie work on computer, excercise, go for walks, clean the appartment etc)?Secondly: I have steered clear of sleeping meds so far, but I do have two ‘just in case’: benadryl and temazepam (restoril in the states). Which one would be the best to start with, just to try and get a good night sleep and break this pattern?Thanks in advance for your advice. And I apologize for any spelling errors, English is not my native language and it’s so hard to focus rn.
Signal	I am posting on behalf of my mom. She is a 46-year-old female, she has some health conditions but are well managed. For the past six months, she has had insomnia. The insomnia is affecting her daily life; she has headaches and nausea on her really bad days. She is stressed by the lack of sleep and can’t function well during the day. Her doctor has tried giving her antidepressants and some benzos, but they haven't helped. She still sleeps poorly, and the medication leaves her feeling groggy all day. She has seen her doctor every two weeks for the last three months as he follows up on the medication. In her last visit, her doctor insisted she is depressed because she sounds "desperate" when she talks about her lack of sleep. She insisted that she is frustrated because she can't sleep. The doctor gave her an ultimatum and said that she can either try the antidepressant treatment he is giving, or she can continue without sleeping. She is incredibly frustrated and hence why I'm turning to Reddit. My mom only speaks Spanish, and there are not many PCP's who speak Spanish in our area, switching docs would be challenging. At her request, he gave her Lunesta, which helped her a lot, but her doctor said he is not issuing more refills for it. Lunesta, he says, is only for short-term use. Any ideas or suggestions of what she can do here? Obviously, due to COVID concerns, a sleep study may not be possible. Should she request a referral to a psychiatrist or neurologist?
NotSignal	For a while now the earliest I’ve fallen asleep is 2 in the morning. As of recent I’ve only been sleeping every other day and it kinda sucks. I don’t drink caffeine or anything either so idk
Signal	I haven't slept all weekend and now I have to go in at 10 tonight. I just needed somewhere to vent because it sounds like complaining to everyone else. Fuck my life. Last time I worked 3rd shift I didn't sleep for days at a time.
NotSignal	I’ve heard doing SRT while having ADHD or bipolar disorder can not be effective and make it worseBut, I’m unclearI wanted to see if anyone has tried it while having that and found it to be effective or made your sleeping issues worse
NotSignal	Hey everyone, Might be a bit unrelated here, but I had to follow a 'short' course of ibuprofen ( 600mg/day, 11 days ), to combat the infection following an operation on my foot. While I knew of the stomach issues that often come with ibuprofen, it didn't hit me until I quit strangely enough. First day after, I was met with extreme acid reflux at night. Definetely keeps me awake, jolts me awake while asleep if I happen to position myself with my stomach down during sleep. Now taking small dose of proton pump inhibitor, but with varying degrees of success. Some foods trigger me more than others, and the med can't stop these kind of foods from triggering it.Long story short, I don't want to keep taking this proton pump inhibitor ( 2 weeks max. ). These meds only mask he symptoms, at best, but don't address the cause. Anyone have any suggestions for a good anti-reflux diet? Read it should be high in alkalines? I love tomatoes but they're a bitch right now lol.
Signal	I’ve been a long time insomniac but I’ve recently started to get on a right track and have some decent sleep, i still get the no sleep nights from time to time but i power through. My anxiety about sleep gets pretty bad a day or the night before i have to go on vacantion somewhere, i know that some people will say “it’s normal you’re just excited” but i have a pattern of barely sleeping on holidays in the past and that makes me anxious and unable to sleep. How can i combat this and not feel so anxious the night before? Thanks
NotSignal	I recently traveled to my hometown, I’ll be staying here for some time due to the pandemic..but I have only gotten 4 hours of sleep tops every night. Can’t seem to settle my anxiety at night especially. Anyway it’s only been a week of this sleep stuff.. anyone have any tips or whats your insomnia like? I pray this goes away soon... it’s too much for me.Thank you!
Signal	Good Morning All,i'am looking for advice if possible... i've been doing weights since i was 21, i'am now 31, in october 2019 i took a break from them to recover from stomach issues what was found out to be helicobacter and gastritis after recovering and getting the all clear from that i started going to the gym again in january 2020, my regime consists of progressive overload. My workout time is around 11am Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.I believe the gym has started triggering some sort of insomnia, I dont have a problem falling asleep it is rather the quality of sleep, almost as if i'm sleeping but my mind is still awake doing overtime. I wake up dazed, fatigued, depressed and mentally drained.I have spoke to 2 doctors who believe i must be a one off case as they have never heard of exercise that worsens sleep but rather it helps sleep, numerous times i have tested the theory and if i dont exercise i will have a good quality sleep but if i exercise on the monday i will suffer with insomnia most that week.The things i have tried are stretching before and post workout, hydrating as much as i can with water and coconut water, starting over with weight by going light and building back up, taking a bath before bed. Nothing i have done has helped and i didn't want to give up a passion but i'm mentally exhausted where its maybe time to give up weight training as neither myself can find answers and gp's have never heard of it.The only supplements i take are whey protein, creatine and multivitamin.Has anyone experienced this, is there help or a cure if you will for it? or is it a simple case of having to quit as mentally sleep is more important?thank you for your time
NotSignal	The bed is evil. Insomnia can suck assI just want a good night's sleep tonight thats allAnxiety is a 24/7 jobIts unrelenting....tiring Therepy appointments next week. I can't wait. Something needs to be done so I don't suffer. Hello Darkness my old friend.....
Signal	I took 20mg of ambien, 2 mg of klonopin and one Kirkland sleep aid just right now. Usually all it takes is 15mg of ambien and I’m out, Idk what’s going on, stress probably
Signal	i used to take melatonin to help me sleep but it just recently stopped working on me so now my sleeping schedule consists of me sleeping for like 10 hours then the next day i get no sleep at all. atm i can’t go see my doctor and even if i waited till quarantine is over i’ll be 18 by then and he won’t be my doctor anymore. walk-in clinics don’t seem very ideal atm either. so i was wondering if any sleepytime teas have actually helped anybody falls asleep quickly? i just really want to sleep dude.
Signal	Please i need some advice. I’m on holiday and i cannot sleep at all. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been and insomniac for 6-7 years and everytime i go on holiday i cannot sleep for the enteriety of the stay. I cannot even enjoy a god damn break. Fml. Please i need help
Signal	I've had sleep issues since I was a toddler. I'm 20 years old now and have been on and off so many damn drugs to treat insomnia, most recently got off Klonopin after it losing it's effectiveness after many years. I'm now on Seroquel after sleeping 2-4 hours a night for 2 weeks from the Klonopin withdrawal. The Seroquel doesn't make me get 8 hours, but I'm able to somewhat sleep maybe 5-7. I've tried sleeping without the Seroquel and my body simply does not fall asleep.I'm posting this because I worry if I will be dependent on drugs for falling asleep for the rest of my life. I just jump from drug to drug. I have no one else that can relate to me, so I'm posting this here.p.s: I've tried flower, edibles, fucking melatonin so dont bother posting that, and pretty much every standard recommendation throughout my entire life
Signal	I've been struggling with insomnia for the past few months, so I tried some magnesium last night. A 200 magnesium citrate powder you dissolve in water.I found I couldn't sleep at all, because every time i started drifting off I got these hypnic jerks that jolted me awake. I also took 1 mg of melatonin.I read that for most people magnesium works to relax them, so why do I have this? On a side note, I also can't handle supplementing vitamin D, it gives me severe insomnia...
NotSignal	I tend to sleep in small 1-3 hour increments through the night and wake up several times (typical insomnia). But when I do sleep I notice that I dream like crazy and often the dreams wake me up and I remember them in full detail. It seems my brain is skipping every other sleep phases and going right to REM sleep constantly. Sometimes it feels like I’m not sleeping at all, or just “lightly” sleeping, until I remember that I was dreaming. Does anyone else experience this as well?!
Signal	my sleep has been getting worse for 2 years. I wake up after 1h30 with vivid dream. I am exhausted and my brain refuses to fall asleep afterwards. I sleep 4 hours a night I can't even Gym. Fuck my life
Signal	Hi! Im 16 years old, my whole life ive always had issues falling asleep. i was sick as a newborn, and my parents were up all night helping me, as a toddler i only slept 6-7 hours a night, which is low for a toddler, as a teen i get lucky if i get 6, luckily i eventually fall asleep, just takes stupidly long.in the passed couple years, ive found myself to get desperate. taking 2-3x recommended melatonin dose, chugging half a bottle of nyquil, taking thc, even would refuse to take my adhd medication at times because i knew that i would sleep just a little less that night. i took lsa(not lsd but relatated) once, i slept 12 hours afterwards, it felt amazingi still, very rarely wake up and feel refreshed, only times ive felt refreshed was after lsa and taking like 4x melatonin dosesi found that if im dreaming, my body stays asleep, ill get a whole 8 hours if i get a dream before i usually wake upanyways, thats just me, hope it was an interesting read
Signal	My dad has bad insomnia, I hear him wake up multiple times a night, watches TV, goes back to sleep.. It doesnt help that hes on bunch of medications as well, and also coughs a lot due to copd/mucous. He has been prescriped amitriptyline but I guess that stopped working. Melatonin and Valerian root never worked. Any other suggestions? Anything OTC/herbal?
Signal	Hey everyone!I'm really struggling to fall asleep and stay asleep lately. I have so much on my mind that I can't stop thinking about things. Even when I purposely tell myself to just clear my mind and think of nothing. I'll think it's working at first, but then when I'm on the cusp of being asleep, I'll realise my mind is starting to dream about what I was trying not to worry about and I'll wake up again.I feel absolutely exhausted as I've only had 2 hours sleep each night since Thursday. I keep trying different sleeping positions, breathing exercises, getting up and doing something, sleeping in another room but no matter how tired I am it's not working.Does anyone with more experience of this have any advice which might help me break this cycle?Thanks 😊
Signal	i have been on ambien for a little now and i’m going to switch over to zyprexa. does anyone know anything about it? or have any suggestions?
Signal	Needless vent ahead, but the title says all.Sporadically, my sleepless nights are interrupted by 2-3 days of proper, restorative sleep but otherwise, each night for the past 2 years, I've been horrifically sleep-deprived. Everything I once valued about myself is gone. I'm constantly in this ruminative, self-loathing state, and I can't find any respite. All the acitivities I once loved require a level of mental exertion that I can't maintain. I once loved creative writing, reading literature and non-fiction, playing musical instruments, gaming, and learning new languages. Far too demanding now, all of them. Now, I can barely string together this paragraph. This underwent a disgusting number of revisions, as it was riddled with grammatical errors and I kept inverting the order of words. And misspelling common words. I find little comfort in socializing, as I'm self-conscious of how inarticulate I've become. I struggle to focus on what others are saying and am constantly blundering. I've become a complete idiot. I've always dreamt of becoming a scientist and doctor. Laughable given my current and likely permanent state. I feel like I'm brain-damaged. Tasks that once took me an hour now require half a day of concerted effort. While I've had periods where I sunk into depression and refused to expend any energy, I'm now being more proactive about my life. I'm seizing every opportunity the competent, lively me would have pounced on. I'm partaking in my favorite recreational activities and experimenting with new, "mindless" ones, but I just find it all dispiriting. I can't remember enjoying the sensation of being alive.I've been seeing a psychiatrist (that also performs psychotherapy) for the past year and a half, and live by every healthy lifestyle platitude under the sun. I've had depression and severe anxiety since early childhood (which has manifested in different compulsive habits over the years). Trazodone was effective, but stunted my cognition even more than sleep deprivation, somehow. Every antidepressent I tried had a negligible effect on mood and sleep. It feels hopeless, and I think to improve, I'm going to have to accept myself, my current limitations, and genuinely enjoy life in this state. But how?Are there any superhuman Redditors that have managed that?
Signal	I really wish I could sleep at night. It doesn’t have to be good sleep, just sleep. I’m tired of being up until the sun comes up and then sleeping all day. Now that I have children, I feel like I’m missing out on so much. Kinda wanna go to the doctor but I feel like it won’t matter.
NotSignal	I'm currently on a course of CBTI. On a related note, fuck CBTI. I've come close to quitting more than once, and I cannot wait until I can just go to bed at a reasonable hour again. Three weeks in and it sucks.Last night's numbers, on the surface, were not good. In bed at midnight. Awake at 4am (our heating comes on then, and I heard it - no clock watching!). Out of bed. Stretch. Read. Back to sleep at 5am. Awake at 630am. Maybe five or five and a half hours sleep, total.But.I fell asleep within ten minutes. When I went back to bed at 5am, I was pretty sure I wouldn't fall back asleep...only to blink and have it be 630. I had no problem getting out of bed to read.And this morning...I feel *rested*. I feel good. I feel like I got a solid seven hours. I may only have had five or so hours...but they were *quality* hours.CBTI still sucks like an Electrolux. But it sucks a little less today.
Signal	Since I was a little kid, it takes me at least 30 minutes to get to sleep, usually 1 hour. I assume that's normal.For the past month things have gotten worse, though. It's now taking me 2-3 hours to go to sleep every night, even though my eyes are burning and I am really, really tired. I'm tired all day long, and I really want to sleep. But despite taking as much as 15 mg of melatonin on some nights, I just can't get to sleep quickly. I do not get up and watch some TV or anything -- those are 2-3 hours just laying in bed doing nothing at all, trying to clear my mind.How long is too long? When does this start to be considered insomnia? I'm probably not going to be able to get any sleep at all before my upcoming AP tests.
NotSignal	This is the basic law: you can't keep awake for a very long time. Most people will fall sleep very shortly after 5 days awake.This is also how the sleep restriction therapy works. I think no one on the earth can keep awake for 14 days or more.
Signal	Hello everyone! Happy to be here! English is not my first language so bare with me. I have insomnia since i was a child, i remeber being little and telling my dad i was scared of sleeping also i remeber that my parents used to obligate me to sleep around 7 pm when i was around 6/7 and i just couldn’t, my childood was that being an insomiac and watching a lot of tv to get me sleepy, sleeping around 10 then waking up at 2 am and getting to sleep again around 4 and waking up at 7 for school. When I got older, i’m 22 now but on my teen years from now sleeping “naturally” has never been a choice. I take “relaxing” pills for sleeping that my psychiatrist game me around 5 years ago. I take quetiapin 100. If I don’t take them of course I can’t sleep but I’m afraid of my brain, it sucks! I start thinking the worst even when i don’t want it to my brain just start fucking being my worst enemy! Even when you’re tired physically and mentally I just can’t shut my brain and it becames annoying and scary. I’m glad I found a community that finally understands this because everyone has experience some time of insomia in their life, yes of course! But the type of insomnia that you’ve been dealing with since you were a child idk not a lot of people understands and it can get lonely when you want to share your experience or something. I have been to psychiatrist but nothing like a sleep especialist idk if someone know where can I go to help my insomia please tell me!
Signal	I have no idea what I should do and I need some positive advice. I have been experiencing off and on insomnia since over a year ago. I was able to manage it for the first 6 months but now it gets to a point where I will sometimes sleep only 1 or 2 hours a night for 4 nights in a row, and then I’m lucky to get 4 - 5 hours the next night. Currently what I do is: 1) I exercise an hour each day at the gym. 2) Meditation for approx 10 min daily. 3) I have done CBT-I. 4) I do sleep restriction therapy 5) I eat really healthy and I never eat heavy meals in the evening.6) I don’t drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. 7) I no longer drink caffeine. 8) I have a weekly therapy session with a therapist and since CBT doesn’t seem to work for me all we do is talk about my childhood (note: my childhood was amazing and trauma-free) 9) I take natural sleep aids like chamomile tea, valerian root and melatonin My process now is that I have around 4 or 5 bad nights in a row until I crack (I become super anxious and start having OCD tendencies which I never used to get before the insomnia), and then I take a low dose of Valium (2.5mg) just so I can break the cycle, and then I start doing good for a few nights and then suddenly it’s shit again and the cycle begins. My therapist and a psychologist diagnosed me with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and OCD (although these symptoms disappear when I get good sleep). And they’re trying to convince me to get on antidepressants like Lexapro or Mirtazapine which I’m refusing to take. I feel like I’m the most pro active insomniac and nothing seems to be working for me. I almost feel like dying at this point would just be easier for me. Please give me some positive advice.
Signal	I've struggled with insomnia all my life, I remember as a kid going downstairs or to my parents room complaining I cant sleep, usually it was one or two days in a row then I'd go back to normal no big deal. Well over the past few weeks it's been bad, two weeks ago (roughly) I couldn't sleep one night and eventually cried myself to sleep out of frustration and slept fine the next night. Two nights after that I couldnt fall asleep until 5 am (new record!!!) I even went to my parents room and asked my mom to read to me. I had a week of iffy sleep with the help of melatonin, now I've had two nights of insomnia this week where melatonin hasnt worked for me at all. I'll go to bed feeling tired, I really thought tonight would be the night, but the moment I lay down and close my eyes it all disappears. I'm getting sleep anxiety too which is a huge help /s. This is getting to a scary point for me and I had a conversation with my mom about seeking out meds to help me just get back to a regular sleep schedule and actually feeling tired when I go to bed.
Signal	hello,I'm a long time sufferer of insomnia. When I was a child I would just lay in bed feeling restless and not being able to fall asleep for hours, and when I get older I guess it just turned into not being able to sleep at all? A few weeks ago I was prescribed ambien (only 2 weeks worth because it was supposed to help me get into a routine of going to sleep at the same time everyday) but now when I lay down to sleep I just feel super anxious, I get this "cold" feeling in my chest and it feels like something is crawling up my neck and it's awful. I made myself an appointment with a therapist for CBT because I've heard that helps, but it isn't for another month. I don't know what to do until then. I've heard only going to sleep when you are really tired helps, but if I do that I just end up not sleeping for 2 days straight. I feel so helpless right now.
Signal	I used to have problems falling asleep, but i have fixed my schedule. Every saturday i eat pizza and drink energy drink in the morning. In the evening even tho my body is exhausted, my mind won't allow me to sleep until it just gets too exhausted to function. Is there a solution to this. I'm drinking coffee every morning and i have no issues.
Signal	Sorry for my english. I wasn’t planning on apologizing for it until I finished my post – it was a struggle, hope the message gets through though.I’ve been having trouble falling asleep my entire life. About 2 months ago, after staying awake the entire night, I was complaining to my partner about it and he asked me what am I going to do to help myself, which sparked a thought – I’m not really doing that much about it anymore, except for just laying in bed for hours waiting to fall asleep. I also didn’t want to be that person who’s just complaining about how much their life sucks and not doing anything to fix it. Feeling sorry for themselves. So I decided to implement all of the things that are proven to help falling asleep at the same time. I wrote down my masterplan and proceeded to implement it every single day. After about a month I’ve started to slack off on it little by little, but it has convinced me that I am capable of falling asleep in a short amount of time, which led to me falling asleep in 15 minutes even with just the bare minimum of my routine, like taking a shower and brushing my teeth. Here’s the stuff that’s helped me.&#x200B;1. Do you want the next day to happenThe main thing causing my insomnia was not wanting the next day to come for various reasons. It came along with depression and anxiety. Fixing those circumstances was crucial in my ability to sleep, but even though I got rid of them my brain kept me believing I can’t sleep – it wasn’t until I implemented following activities that I was capable of developing a sleeping schedule.2. Electronic devicesAs we all know, blue light might cause trouble sleeping. I try to turn them off 2 hours before sleep.3. Bedtime routine – making your brain associate things with sleepDepression made me give up even on showering at night – the basic routine that made my body know it’s sleep time since I can even remember. I’ve decided to establish a 2 hour long routine:1) Taking care of my surroundingsFor me it consisted of turning off electronic devices and cleaning my room and the kitchen – both things were also making the morning routine easier and made me dread it that little bit less. I’d also close the shutters, turn off all ceiling lamps and leave on only small light sources. I’d try to avoid any activities that were stimulating and limit myself to mindless things like cleaning. 2) Taking care of my bodyI’d take a shower or a bath and get into actual pijamas, not just come sweatsuit I’ve been wearing during the day. I’d also get myself plenty of water next to the bed so I’m not dehydrated and don’t have to get up to get it at night. I’d keep a notebook next to my bed so I can write down things I have to do, some ideas, anything that I might want to remember the next day. Writing them down would stop my brain from dwelling on these things or worring I want remember them the next day. I’d write those things down throught the entire routine. Eventually I’d lie down and focus on my body, trying to notice if there is any tension or pain. In case of tense muscles I’d massage and squeze them (discovering that I can massage almost all of my body by myself was a lifechanger in terms of body pain and discomfort) and do progressive muscle relaxation – that one was really helpful with clenched jaw and frawn forehead. I’d also take care of any actual body dysfunctions – for me it’s r/noburp – main things I can do to relieve the dyscomfort caused by it is taking simeticon at night, abdominal massage, practicing diaphragm breathing – during the last two I’d count the moves or breathes, which was sort of like meditating – letting go of thoughts and focusing on counting. Ultimately I’d move on to actual meditiation which I’ve learned through Headspace app, or start fantasizing instead – this is how I used to fall asleep as a child. I’ve stopped fantasizing once I realized my limitations caused by social anxiety, which would make me not even be able or want to imagine myself doing things I know would cause me anxiety in reality. But I’ve been actively discovering my sexuality for the past couple of months, which led to increased libido and sexual fantasizing and it’s really helped with falling asleep because it takes my mind off of reality, possible worries and expectations and anything that can put my brain in a task mode.This is what's helped me, but it can be adjusted to whatever your circumstances are. Hope it helps.
NotSignal	I just can’t no more is like little naps through the night
NotSignal	First time poster. It feels like I don’t sleep at all. Its so frustrating to not be able to sleep like a normal person. Has anyone found any tips/hacks to getting to sleep? Last night was awful. I laid down at 9 pm, tossed and turned until about 6 am. Unsure if I snoozed at all, but was up at 7 am for work. This is taking a toll on me. I feel like I’ve tried every conventional sleeping tip. Also: does anyone else feel insane twangs of jealousy/maybe even anger seeing their partner next to them sleeping soundly.... Uhg
NotSignal	As the title says, every night as I am falling asleep I start to get a massive headache. I try to not take any over the counter pain killers as I do not want to start that cycle. I have tried taking over the counter sleep aides which do help the initial sleep but I always wake up in the middle of the night with an even worse headache, I would actually classify it as a migraine, and my head just throbs for about an hour or two then I can fall back asleep. Not sure what to do if I have an allergy to over the counter sleep aides or what but was just curious if anyone else has had this experience and what they did to resolve it?
NotSignal	Just curious as someone who doesn’t suffer from insomnia, I always wondered how you guys/gals live with this. You have my respect
NotSignal	PREFACE: This might be better for r/askdocs but NO ONE answers me there so I thought this was a good option. So for the past week or so, I’ve had some symptoms that I don’t usually feel. The most notable symptoms have been dizziness/vertigo (can’t balance, feels like I’m swaying/spinning) and brain fog. The brain fog I’m feeling is like this: I can’t think straight, my memory is really off, I’m not thinking as clearly or as sharply as I normally do and it’s hard to focus. I’ve also had slight headaches, but not migraines.I went to the doctor yesterday and she said that it could’ve been either sleep related, virally related (which she was leaning towards, yet I don’t have a virus) or a concussion. She mentioned concussion because I mentioned that I do occasionally headbang/thrash to heavy music (I didn’t do it too hard though and I did that on the same day that I started noticing the brain fog (but I think it was after). My brother said that he felt all of the same symptoms when he didn’t get sleep for a long time. He also mentioned how when you get REM sleep, cerebrospinal fluid goes to the brain and cleanses off the plaque which I’m pretty sure is true. I just don’t think it’s related to sleep because I feel well rested/energized (could just be my natural restlessness) yet the brain fog is still there.Anyone have an idea of if this is related to sleep issues at all, dizziness included?
NotSignal	I been sleeping for the couple days 3 to 4 hours straight wake up then 2 hours more of sleep 😴.. this is better than waking every hour or 2
NotSignal	i finally got on top of a sleep schedule with exercise, right eating times, all the bs doctors complain about combined with days without sleep and had a schedule for more than 2 days. it felt amazing. tonight as soon as i lay down a spider or something bit my arm. (i have arachnophobia or im just insanely scared of them ig) and it freaked me out and now i cant even go in my room. sorry for the rant. hows ur night/morning
Signal	I remember once when taking my first ever antipsychotic, i slept for over 12 hours, eventually with time this went down to 6 hours after my body tolerated it better. Now my body is completely tolerable to this particular antipsychotic i am taking, it's to the point taking them before bed won't cause any tiredness or etc. my drowsiness take's its form during the day. i can never sleep for more than 7 hours regardless if i nap or not. For example i got into bed at 1:00 AM, with severe tossing and turning i think i fell asleep at 1:40 AM, when i woke up it was 6:30 AM, i than got up and went back to sleep from 9:00 AM to 1:30 PM. Now i will feel the insatiable urge to go to sleep again around 5pm, for another few hours. It's a cyclone that goes in circles. I just want to sleep like a normal person from 1:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and have a short 20 min nap midday. I believe my body wants 10 hours sleep, so it is making up for it with these naps
Signal	I took it two nights ago because I hadn't slept at all the previous night. Worked like a charm. I didn't take it last night and only managed to fall asleep at 4AM with some extreme bouts of tachycardia leading me to go to the ER today. The doctor recommended I keep taking Zopiclone for a short while.How long can you safely take it?
Signal	Every day, all day, I’m tired but can’t sleep until I’m completely exhausted. I wake up without feeling like I rested at all and I’m getting so tired of it all. My mind never shuts off, leaving me tossing and turning for hours until I finally drift away, but all it feels like is closing my eyes for a couple seconds, then, the sun’s up and it’s midday. Every aspect of my life sucks so much. I’m struggling throughout my waking moments with constant thoughts of death and I’m stuck waiting for sleep, only for my dreams to be stressful as shit. Hell, some nights, I’m even awake until noon or later. Completely exhausted, but my mind just won’t stop.a
Signal	So I've been developing worse and worse insomnia and I've tried to get my psychiatrist to give me real sleep meds but he just keeps telling me to work on my sleep hygiene and giving my anti-psychotics with low doses that sometimes work as a sleep aid (that dont work). I've tried so many different tricks to get myself to fall asleep. Once I'm unconcious I'm good, most of the time. Unless I have an appointment the next day then I'm kinda restless.Tea, reading, white noise, staring at a spot on the wall, meditation, deep breathing, regular bed times and wake up times, showering before bed, music, having simple routines, being really active/busy during the day, staying away from my phone, the list goes on.And what I find happens is sometimes the tricks work, and then I use them for a couple days and I fall asleep decently. But then on day 3 or 4 of using the trick it stops working no matter how hard I try, and it keeps happening, with different things. I can only see the phsyciatrist once a month and not sleeping for that entire time really fucks with a person, yknow?Does anyone else have similar experiences?TL:DR - Feeling a little lost and not listened to by my doctor, using different tricks stops working after awhile.
Signal	Anyone here affected by this? As someone with insomnia, I should've known better to let my body adjust to the external clock and slowly shift my way over but- didn't get sleep last night, prolly gonna take a while until things go back to the way they were. Had to leave during morning class cause was about to pass out along with incoming panic attack
Signal	my anxiety + my insomnia = i can’t remember the last time i slept :(
NotSignal	I’ve always had a bit of a rough time sleeping for as long as I can remember but over the past couple of years it’s gotten worse and worse to the point where recently I spend at least 2 nights entirely sleepless a week and spend at least around 2 - 4 hours minimum falling asleep every night no matter the circumstance (unless very drunk or the like but for my own health I don’t do this much). I’m not an anxious person by any means and have no disorders diagnosed nor do I believe I have any anxiety disorder or anything like that, I am a self confident person and don’t have too many future worries. I understand that quarantine does not help things like this at all. however, I have online classes which gives me a weekly schedule to stick to but I cannot fall asleep for the life of me. Although this quarantine is a terrible situation I feel I can handle this well and I’m going to get through it fine as I’m working well and getting decent excersize (although I am trying to do more). I have never tried any medication and have not gone to a doctor as I do not feel it will be taken seriously as I have no other anxiety or the like (not going to just waltz in saying I can’t sleep with no other problems). Honestly this is all just really really annoying and inconvenient as I feel all this time I spend trying to sleep could be used to have fun or be productive or the like, and my days are spent being tired and loading up on coffee. I try not to take any caffeine unless I’m really hanging as to not get dependent.I have tried all the turning all the electronics off hours before and taking “relaxing baths”, and reading for hours before but I end up falling asleep in an hour or two anyway and adding that to the hours I spent “relaxing” it still adds up to 4 to 5 hours so I feel it’s worthless.I don’t really understand where this is coming from, I don’t believe there is any genetic disorders due to sleep through my parents or grandparents as they all sleep relatively normally.I have absolutely no idea what’s up tbh if anybody has any idea or possible ways to combat this it would be appreciated:)Thank you :)))
Signal	Has anyone noticed their eyesight worsen over prolonged periods using melatonin or any other sleeping aids?My eyesight has dramatically worsened over the past two years (70% down to 40%). Anyway I wondered if it might have been the melatonin and actually found a study which found eye problems in patients taking melatonin, anti depressants and a high protein diet. Apparently they improved after removing those factors (I’m not super medically literate if someone else find the study).
Signal	I've been struggling with falling asleep and having vivid nightmares on and off since my dad's passing, 15 months ago. For the last month or so, I've been crying myself to sleep, resting little and having bad memories flash up while dozing off. It's absolutely horrible and I feel miserable most of the time, but yesterday, for some reason, things went well for me and I fell asleep quickly, had great dreams and woke up refreshed. I felt alright for the first time in months.If only this happened more often, I'm sure my days wouldn't be as miserable.
Signal	I'm an overthinker in general and altough I have some sleepless nights, typically I fall asleep in the early morning hours around 5-6 am. About a week ago, I started having anxiety regarding various personal issues that werent serious yet but enough to keep me awake. This cascaded into lesser sleep as each day passed by. Four days later, I had only one hour sleep at night and I had a long travel ahead in which I had to stay awake. Meanwhile, this also caused gastritis which was also induced by anxiety and kept me further awake at night. On the 4th day, I tried resting in my bed early, but I dodnt not sleep the entire night. The next morning, my heart was beating so fast, my body was so exhausted yet my mind was really active. I tried taking two sleeping pills (over the counter) midday since it was the weekend to try to sleep but it didnt help. Each time I try to fall asleep, I can feel my body was ready, but my mind wasn't. At the cusp of falling asleep, my anxiety makes causes me to wake back up again. After reading this tread and a couple of other blogs, I went to the pharmacy to get myself Melatonin tablets. At 8pm I took 1 mg and fell asleep. Next few days I followed with a few doses at night and regular diet. Now I have recovered from last week and getting back to the rhythm. Is this story similar to anyone? How did you solve yours?
Signal	I have health anxieties. I don’t know if this is anxieties attack or my head is actually injured and I can’t sleep. I’ve been in bed for 4 hours!
NotSignal	It’s currently 4:34 AM CST and I’ve tried about everything to fall asleep tonight. I really need to be asleep because tomorrow is the day I get to pick my mother up from the hospital and I don’t want to spend all day super tired when I’m trying to celebrate my moms return home. It feels almost like sleep isn’t going to come at all. Like I’m just as awake as I was when I first woke up 19 hours ago. I’ve purposely stayed up much longer on gaming binges and stuff but it doesn’t feel the same. It the inability to even sleep when I know I should be well asleep right now. I’m honestly at a loss for what to do, seriously considering saying fuck it and staying up for as long as possible and crashing for a while, I feel like I’m running out of options.
Signal	Hey everyone. Never posted here but I'm desperate for some help.I've always been a night owl but can usually fall asleep right when I'm ready for bed.Lately I can't sleep at all. This has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I have been prescribed Ativan and trazadone and still nothing. Im able to stay up 30+ hours after just a short 5 hours of restless sleep when I do finally get to bed. Feel like I'm going crazy and would love some advice. Does anyone else experience "random or sudden" insomnia for this long??
Signal	i’ve been taking 3 sleep medications for 4 years and since i don’t have school or anything i decided to try a couple night without. Well let’s just say that i have not slept in 72 hours. my eyes are so dry and my body is aching, my head is pounding and my thoughts sound like shouting sometimes. i ended up taking my meds earlier tonight because it’s driving me crazy. the last time this happened to me was a couple of years ago and i had to go to the doctor, but now with quarantine i know i won’t be able to. this was kind of just a rant, sorry. it’s 3:42 and i just want to go to sleep...
NotSignal	I am not sure why, but it comes from my innate need to escape the night time, scared to be dragged into it and scared to be taken over by it, I am not sure if I need a therapist but I think it's best to get help.
NotSignal	After 2 days of literally 0 sleep, I was sure I was gonna die if I didn't sleep last night. My insomnia was manifested because of my extreme anxiety. My chest hurt everytime I tried to sleep. I was a mess last night so much so that I called my sister and told her to sit by me while I slept. And I did. I slept before she did. After like no social contact for 2ish months, my brain was lonely or at least that's what I'm telling myself.
Signal	Hey what's up guys. I went through a horrible time about 9 months back. Major move, new job, lots of life stressors. I ended up getting really bad insomnia and pumping myself full of meds out of sheer terror of what was going on with me. Ended up thinking I was hypomani/bipolar because I was like trying to workout and run etc on no sleep trying to fight through it. I slowly worked through it with meditation and acceptance and ended up sleeping well again. For the past 3 months, I've slept like 8 or 9 hours a night every single night! It was amazing. I was going to come on Reddit to tell all you guys about what I did so I could help you out. But Then about 7 days ago, it came back. I woke up after 10 minutes of falling asleep. panicked, and stayed up all night. Been dealing with it all over again now! Has this happened to any of you? Complete recovery just to be back in the same spot again?Second question, I can't decide if it's better to take 1/2 a klonopin and 25mg Seroquel and sleep (my magic combo), or pull all nighters unmedicated and try again the next night?
NotSignal	Ever since I've moved back in with my parents temporarily, I notice that my old bed is much more firm than I remember. I find it harder to get into a comfortable position and can toss and turn an hour or two before finally falling asleep.
Signal	Just came here for tip/reminder to my fellow insomniacs. Everyone knows the drill: no caffeine (past “x” time ar least); phone off an hour early, no TV at night, etc etc. But people commonly forget temperature of the room and weight / comfort of the blankets. I’ve suffered since I was a young child and now (30y/o) I still forget the simplest task- turn down the thermostat. I will finally at 3-4am get so mad I can’t sleep, get up frustrated and check the room that says it’s 70F or more. In any season I will make sure the a/c is on below 68 (I like 64 most) and then I will add an extra blanket for weight. Especially if you suffer from anxiety as well, this extra blanket will change your life. Literally 2-4 degrees can make such a difference - no matter what the temp is, lower it by just 2 degrees and your body will thank you. I sleep with my parter who wants nothing to do with barely any blankets, so I put my extra one underneath the sheet over only me. **Mexican blankets are THE BEST in my opinion because they keep you warm, are weighted slightly, but still insanely breathable so you don’t sweat**Extra tip (no charge): change the pillow you are using when you can’t fall asleep. Doesn’t matter what it is; throw pillow, couch, one from a siblings room, anything but the one you’ve been laying restlessly awake on. TLDR: lower the temp of your room by 2-4 degrees before bed. Add a blanket for weight. Change the pillow (or pillow case) you’re using.
NotSignal	I’m getting close to the end now I think, Another sleepless night and I’ve got a party to go to later on. Starting to think that it just isn’t worth it carrying on. I am very tired and for the last 2 hours my eyes have been closed but nothing has happened at all. I’m beyond the point of salvation.
Signal	I have had chronic insomnia for 5 years and even as a child was never able to sleep more than 7 hours.I am exhausted of trying and failing to find a way to get more sleep.I've gone through various medications (melatonin, circadin, etc etc) and truly nothing has had any lasting or sustainable difference (nothing under a 30mg dose has any effect and taking over 10mg a day is not very sustainable).My sleep deprivation has led to continuous concentration issues, headaches and other such consequences of not getting enough rest. I've gone through meditation courses, know all the sleep hygiene sheets off by heart, went to sleep clinics, do yoga, cater my diet to being sleep-friendly but no luck. I exercise daily, at least 10k steps a day so it's not for lack of activity that I cannot sleep.I honestly don't know what to do, every time I get my prescription I tell them there has been little to no effect and all that is done is my dose is again made higher or they change my medication to something that is supposed to hello better in some way. As of now, I am taking 10mg of circadin a night but have tried higher doses out of frustration after long days of little to no sleep (dangerous I know but in my defence, after 70 hours you just don't have the energy to care) (50mg which made me fall asleep quite well but I awoke in 5 hours)I welcome suggestions and advice, I am truly suffering from this and want to be able to live without such bone-deep exhaustion weighing me down.I am only 15, I am scared of how this extended sleep deprivation will affect my development. I can hardly get 4 hours most nights and can go without more than a couple hours sleep across 2 to 3 days at least twice a month. This isn't healthy or ok. I have seen my gp but it took 4 years to get my guardian to take my insomnia seriously and the gp didn't seem to be overly concerned either. I'd go to a doctor but in these times of lockdown in London that is difficult.I just want to be able to sleep normally, to go to bed at 10pm and be asleep within the hour (I have spent too many hours lying in the dark listening to various sleep playlists). I want to be able to get to sleep and stay asleep, not wake up within 4 hours. I have not slept in 42 hours and this is what hell is.Hell is lying awake all night in agonising clarity. I dearly hope you all are sleeping more manageably x
NotSignal	sleep deprived prob since 4 months ago and a friend told me that i was gonna die young jokingly. But in reality this actually hit me because as a 17 year old i can't get a normal sleep schedule and well, it's all coming closer
NotSignal	I used to be so paranoid I had sfi. It was literally the scariest thing I ever heard of. I still regret reading about it to this day.
NotSignal	I’m awake and can’t get any sleep sooooooooo anyone else here too?
NotSignal	Preferably an active noise cancelling one that's comfortable to sleep in. I can't afford the Bose sleep earphones, so if anyone knows some more cheaper alternatives that'd be appreciated
NotSignal	Hello fellow insomniacs,I'm a recovering insomniac that has struggled with clinically diagnosed insomnia for the past 3+ years. I recently graduated from highschool and I'm on a gap year. I've always wanted to blog about my personal struggles with insomnia and today I don't know what hit me but I thought if I could make that idea of mine a reality. I want to start a website which is essentially a community comprised of insomniacs who know what it is like to be one to support and share our knowledge in a dedicated platform to help others in the community. Insomnia has been a condition closely linked to mental health and with each passing year, it only seems like both conditions worsen over time.I intend on creating a youth led platform comprised of students from 15-25. If anyone is interested in the initiative please don't hesitate to PM me! I'd really appreciate being able to make this community a reality.
NotSignal	For me, it’s OCD and anxiety.Hbu?Filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler
Signal	Quarantine has really screwed up my sleep schedule (even more than before, which is really saying a *lot*), and I’ve found myself unable to fall asleep until 4am or later. To get back on track, is it better to let myself sleep in or wake up early and be exhausted? Does anyone have any tips?
NotSignal	Nobody who’s suffered from insomnia and come out of it are hanging around here, nobody wants to be reminded of their worst times. The only people lurking this sub and those of us still suffering from insomnia who haven’t come out the other side. I wish you all well, there WILL be light at the end of the tunnel. This isn’t you forever, nothing ever has been and nothing ever will. Be strong. Be smart.
NotSignal	It’s happening again everybody is sleeping expect me I’m crying I’m breaking down I’m done with this I can’t take this anymore
Signal	Right now i'm studying for my exams. Since i'm at home and don't have to go anywhere i can wake up whenever i want. But i can not control when i fall asleep. Right now it's 4 am and i'll probably stay up for another 4 hours. And it sucks. Because sometimes i do have to wake up at a certain time. But due to my completely fucked up sleep schedule that would mean no sleep for me. I feel like my body was made for an earth that rotates much slower because every day i fall asleep a little bit later than the day before. The problem is if i go to bed too early i won't be able to sleep and just lie there while crazy thoughts go through my mind. Then i need to get up and do something different but because i kind of got some rest without actually sleeping my body isn't tired anymore and i won't be able to sleep for several hours. Of course i could just sleep less so that i'll get tired much earlier. But if i do that i feel like shit the next day. Also i'd like to change my sleep cycle. I tried pulling an all nighter but the result is truly depressing. Because if i do that it works well the first few hours i stay awake. But like in the middle of the day the tiredness hits me like a truck. But if i took a nap it'd ruin everything so i try to stay awake but it's so difficult. If i just closed my eyes for a second i'd instantly fall asleep. That usually lasts for a bunch of hours. But then finally in the evening when it's bed time i am not tired anymore. Not at all. It's so frustrating. Now that wouldn't be that much of a problem if i didn't have to study that much because i cannot study if i'm that tired. Meanwhile i get extremely angry when i can't sleep which doesn't help at all but it's just too frustrating. I really don't understand my body. Sometimes i just wake up after 3 hours without being able to sleep anymore. Sometimes i lie there for 2 hours and i'll finally sleep again. Sometimes i lie there for 5 hours and nothing happens. Honestly i don't know what to do anymore. I'm sorry i wrote too much, i just can't take it anymore. Feels like i'm spending most of my life with sleeping or trying to sleep yet i'm always tired. Honestly fuck off brain.
Signal	completely exhausted, brain is overactive to the point of paranoia, spent 6 hours tossing and turning or trying to meditate or reading books, everything failed to relax me, fell asleep while crying 15 minutes before my alarm and had a dream in which i was gripping my phone looking at the time and panicking more and more with every minute passing, my mom was standing over me in a dream saying "you have to gwt up soon" over and over. and now i have to work an 8 hour shift and deal with people and life like this. when does it end
Signal	Starting having bad anxiety and insomnia 3 nights ago starting my fourth afraid. First night only got 1-2 hours second got about 4 third 5-6. Hoping I can get some more tonight. Just get so much fear and anxiety about the night i know I'm.not supposed to worry about sleep but it's not possible to not worry. I worry my mental health will get worse and worse how much sleep you guys get most nights on a bad run ?
Signal	listen up. i had my sleeping routine on lock. it was there. i held it in my precious grasp. did i still wake up throughout the night and end up playing some history show on mute that i would eventually hope to pass out to? yes. was it still better than anything i had before? yes. now, i still have a caffeine habit that needs to break, but i work very demanding jobs. i work off the caffeine at well, work. and if i didn’t? i was developing a pretty *sick* gum routine that was not only getting me more fit than i’ve ever been, but was also knocking me out! now: i can’t go to work, i can’t go workout, i still have a caffeine habit so i’m just sleeping when i can get it, illegally streaming sabrina (1954) multiple times a night, and i know that there are bigger problems. i get it. that doesn’t erase the fact that my carefully, years in the making routine, has now been destroyed into dust before my very eyes.
Signal	I have sleep on set + sleep maintenance insomnia and this week is by far the worst I have experienced since I started to have insomnia. I’ve been getting between 1-3 hours of sleep and occasionnaly a sleepless night. When I fall asleep it’s never before 6am and I wake up after 1h30-2h of sleep.Today im feeling really foggy. I’m just hoping to get a huge chunk of sleep somehow soon. Anyone feels like it takes time for their body to feel the urge to sleep?
NotSignal	Sometimes I think if i die, i won't be tired. I would never go through with anything because the thought of my dogs being left suddenly without care is something I couldn't handle, but sometimes the thought of being dead is comforting
Signal	I was hoping it would get better but looks like it's not. I'm getting either a sleepless night or an hour and half. My brain refuses to shut off even when I am sleepy. It's getting to a point where I am afraid it's soon going to multiple sleepless nights in a row. I know that I'll probably start to hallucinate and I've accepted it. I'm just worried about my memory. I'm not done with my semester yet, I still have exams and I'll start to work full time soon. What's it going to be like? This is seriously something I wish nobody had to go through.
NotSignal	Anyone else dealing with seroquel? I gain wait on it. I’m genetically predisposed to diabetes so I got off the seroquel after years of using it last August. I haven’t been sleeping great, but I wasn’t before i stopped either. The tolerance real meant that I took a half dose this week after not sleeping for a week and considering the ER and slept for fucking 12 hours like a happy camper. I felt like a new person. I know it won’t last and feeling it slip away just days later is awful. Advice? Commiseration?
Signal	Hello everyone. I'd like to know everyone's experience with sleeping pills and please state the name of the pill and also advice on how to get them prescribed.Some background info. For some reason when I went on holiday I slept way better at friends house and more soundly but when I'm at home even if I run 10 km I still cant stay asleep. My problem isnt falling asleep it's just that I wake up like 3 times a night. I'm not a stressed individual so I'm not sure what it is that I'm not staying asleep.Senior high school is coming up and if things dont change I'm going to have to go to a shitty university. Anyways I'd like some help on the things I've mentioned.
Signal	So I’ve been an insomniac my entire life. My natural tendency is to fall asleep around 5-6am and sleep until 2pm. The only way I can ever successfully break out of this cycle is when I have a serious responsibility early in the morning like work or school (something that will bring negative consequences if I miss it basically). I’m job searching and have been for the last 4 months, and so because I don’t have a job and I’m done with school, things have gotten really bad with my sleep. Staying up all night and sleeping all day makes me severely anxious and depressed. Mental health wise I’m usually fine during the day until things start to close and the world falls asleep. After that it’s just awful and it just me and my mind the entire night. It’s lonely and I’m starting to lose my motivation for all the things I used to enjoy. I used to love to eat healthy and exercise and all of that, but I’m starting to just not have motivation to do anything. I won’t take medication for this, because I’ve been down that road and I get addicted easily. If I had somewhere to go every morning that I absolutely had to be there, I think it would help... but things like exercise classes or other things I can miss without real consequences are never enough to motivate me. I will always just set an alarm, wake up, and then go right back to bed. I’m sick of living this way, and I just don’t know what to do. A job will fix it all, but until then, this is just torture. Hoping someone maybe has some advice.
NotSignal	idk why but everytime I sleep around 12-1am I always wake up at 3-5am and after some time like 20 mins I go back to sleep and wake up again at 12pm. How do I stop it? It's been happening since the last 4 days.
Signal	I've never had a great relationship with sleep. Even before insomnia, I would have trouble sleeping if I was in a new place (sleepovers at friend's houses didn't work well for me). Likewise, if I had some important thing that I had to do early the next day, I could count on major trouble falling asleep. My first real brush with insomnia was ~16 years old. It lasted for about a month. It would take me 4-6 hours to fall asleep every night, and at least one night I never got to sleep at all. I never saw a doctor, and eventually it passed.Then, about three years ago, in my early-30s, i had a major recurrence. I'd been on a late sleep schedule for a while (falling asleep between 2 and 4 a.m. and sleeping late). Long story short, something came up where I realized I had to be somewhere for something important the following day by like 7 o'clock. I tried forcing myself to go to sleep early, and the result was that I never slept at all that night, finally getting out of bed when I realized that it was close to when my alarm was going to be sounding. I figured I'd sleep good that night because I'd be so tired. But no, instead I spent another sleepless night. In the morning I decided to see a doctor, but since I couldn't get an appointment I went to the ER. Doc at the ER gave me a prescription for Ambien 5mg.The Ambien worked like magic at first, putting me right out. Unfortunately, very quickly it started to wear off. It would put me to sleep, but I'd only sleep for 2-3 hours. I finally saw my primary doctor, and she didn't want me to stay on Ambien long-term, so she suggested I try melatonin and some OTC stuff (I think dextromethorphan). It didn't work, so she tried me out on Trazadone 50mg. That didn't work, so she switched me back to Ambien 5mg. Keep in mind that I was taking it EVERY NIGHT, as I couldn't get to sleep without it. After a while of having the same problem of falling asleep but failing to STAY asleep, she upped the dosage to 10mg. Because of a mistake on my part, I thought I was still taking 5mg, so on some nights I was actually taking two pills thinking it totalled 10mg, but in reality it was 20mg. Even then, the problems persisted.Eventually my doc decided to get me off of Ambien altogether, and put me on Mirtazapine (I believe it was 15mg). Finally, I found something that seemed to work. While I still failed to fall asleep unaided (my doc asked me to try to fall asleep naturally, and only take a pill when I couldn't), the pill seemed to help me get through the night.My doc then had me see a sleep specialist. He said he didn't like people taking pills long-term, so after a sleep apnea test (I didn't have it, thankfully) he weaned my off the Mirtazapine and had me follow a sleep hygiene protocol: turn off the lights as the night got late, refrain from caffeine after 4 p.m., refrain from lying in bed unless I was going to bed, getting out of bet for a while if I was having too much trouble getting to sleep, etc. He also bad me keep a sleep diary, and set up rules where I lay down at the same time every night (11:30), and set my clock for 6 a.m. With my sleep diary, I kept track of approximately how long it took to fall asleep, and took note of any waking periods. No matter what, I had to get out of bed at 6, even if I'd barely gotten any sleep. If I was sleeping ~80% of the time I was in bed for a week straight, I could move my alarm back in 15 minute increments and repeat, 6 to 6:15 to 6:30, and so on. Eventually I started sleeping through the night without any help. Altogether, it has been 5-6 months of hell.Since then I'll still have a bad night every now and then, and on occasion I'll have a night where I can't sleep at all. On the nights when I don't get to sleep, the next night I usually fall asleep very easily.I did post recently about a bit more serious recurrence where I had trouble for about a week. The first night, I couldn't sleep at all, and then the following days it took me hours to fall asleep, and I could only sleep for 2-3 hours. I saw the same sleep specialist from before, but as it had only be a short period, he told me to just follow good sleep hygiene and that I should get back to normal. He was right, and I've had several days of more or less normal sleep.
NotSignal	When I am over exhausted like tonight I fell asleep for 2 hours but I clearly need so much more than that. My body is so tired and my eyes close and even though I’m not asleep yet I already start to see images of things as if I’m dreaming. I can’t fall asleep though. I just started an antidepressant which could be causing the problem. I just didn’t know if anyone else experiences that because thus isn’t the only time. Or my body will like jolt me awake. It’s awful because it’s like I need sleep so bad but my mind won’t let me rest
NotSignal	Idk if this is the right board or not because isomnia is much worse then an "I cant get to sleep often" problem but I did noticed this helped me as I do deep breathing like I am meditating. Knocks me out most the time. When I wake in the middle of the night, I ask alexa to play it again. There is a station for ocean waves too. That also helps. Its hard to sleep without it though once i got used to it.
Signal	Hey guys, I suffer from some sort of insomnia since 6 months. I am waking up every night after 4-5 hours of sleep in the middle of the dreaming state. All of this appeared a couple of days after I used 300-450 mg MDMA crystals. It was my 6th time using it within of 2 years. I always tried to ensure at least 3-4 months breaks.I suppose my serotonin receptors are damaged or the levels have decreased from that abuse. Since, serotonin has a big impact on the rem sleeping state I am worried about these speculations.Fortunately I don't feel depressed. I just feel tired throughout the day due to the incomplete sleep process.Does anyone have an advice or did anyone also experienced this ?I am btw 22.
Signal	Sorry, but I'm just pretty damn scared. And I guess I have basically no reason to be. 18m, 1 and a half months ago I went a full night without sleep and ever since then I haven't been able to sleep properly. Some nights I can get maybe 6 hours of sleep in total but it's really fragmented and I still feel really tired the next day after, which just sucks when you pair it with hypochondria which I've had pretty much my whole life. I know it's irrational but it's still hard to shake off the anxiety that follows, especially when my "symptoms" follow the ones associated with sFI flawlessly. Sudden insomnia, then progressively worse sleep quality and loss of REM phase. Balance issues, loss of appetite and all that jazz. The worst about this aren't the nights where I can't go to sleep until early morning, it's those nights where I get nearly 6 hours in total and still feel tired the day after which is seemingly the actual problem with sFI. Fuck, I just can't shake the thoughts off and I don't know what to do anymore. Is fragmented, poor sleep a possible symptom of anxiety? Or is it just sudden sleep apnea? (I do get a dry mouth after waking up).
Signal	I used to be someone who liked the nighttime, enjoyed my time then when everyone else was asleep, now with my insomnia at an all time high I am getting down around 10-11 PM. Its like I know what’s on the horizon - another night of no sleep or 1-3 hrs if Im lucky. Currently have slept around 8 hrs this past week.Im sure this is bothering a lot of you. I am sick of hearing the get up do something if you can’t sleep. I’m so god damn exhausted mentally, physically I have no interest in staying up, and I know I wont be able to enjoy anything during those times. Hate hearing that! Im bored, tired, dead, last thing I want to do is read or watch TV. I’ve done enough during the day, have nothing else more to do, or want to, just want to fucking rest.
Signal	Sorry to post this here. (and sorry its a long post. I've been posting in r/antidepressants a lot lately but that subreddit only has like 12k followers and nobody ever comments.. so i figured i'd post it here to my fellow insomniacs.So I ended up actually being hospitalized for not sleeping for an entire week. I've already posted on here about it. While I was in the hospital they put me on remeron (mirtazapine) and trazadone for sleep. Trazadone didn't work, the remeron KIND of did. After and also whilst I was in the hospital when they put me on the remeron I still had sleepless nights without it.. It also made me gain 15 lbs in a week, made me feel horrible both day and night, and I found out it was super addictive. I stopped taking the remeron after being on it for 7 days because I read posts like "remeron withdrawal week 30" and no drug no matter how good it is for sleep is ever going to put me in +3 months of withdrawal.So I stopped it after only being on it for 7 days and it lead to the worst 5 sleepless nights in living memory that I've ever had. Not only was I not sleeping, but my waking hours were a living hell. When I would fall asleep I'd wake up covered in sweat and didn't have the energy to get out of bed during the day. It's scary to think about.. but in the past 3 weeks I cannot remember sleeping for more than 2 hours at all, and i'm afraid the part of my brain that puts me to sleep is no longer working and this is eventually going to kill me.. or atleast age me by 10 years if it doesn't fix itself soon. Yesterday was 7 days with a grand total of maybe 10 hours sleep (i'm not even exaggerating) and no remeron and I started walking around in a panic and all I remember is my parents telling me I need to go to the hospital again. One of them convinced me to take 6 mg of remeron and I remember finally falling asleep and waking up 10 hours later.I thought it was impossible to have such bad withdrawal after only taking something for 7 days, but I was wrong. Now that its been 7 days, and I took it once more last night, I have this terrible fear in the pit of my stomach that I've somehow hit the reset button and am gonna not sleep for another 3 days. Can someone please tell me that this is highly unlikely? the fear of not getting sleep has lead to psychological depression and insomnia that I think in turn is CAUSING my own insomnia.
NotSignal	Any idea on how to differentiate whether i’ve got primary or secondary insomnia? Any response would be appreciated!
NotSignal	It is currently 10:50 pm as I am writing this. These days I can’t fall asleep before 2-3 am and wake up at around 5-5:30 am. I guess tonight probably’s going to be a sleepless night because of the party that’s happening in my backyard :)
NotSignal	Sleep doctor called me today and discussed the results of my sleep study conducted two weeks ago.During the sleep study I “felt” like I only slept 1-2 hours but turns out I actually slept 5 hours and 44 minutes. Keep in mind I was in bed for 8 hours from 9pm-5am.I’ve accepted that I am at least sleeping but I’m just in a constant state of hyperarousal which makes it so hard to just drift off into that deep restorative sleep that I miss so much. 😢
NotSignal	Widest night I have ever had plenty of vivid dreams but felt awake the entire time that was something else
Signal	I've had insomnia for the past few years. Ever since I was little, I haven't really needed much sleep. For the past few weeks (probably even months), I've been having these horrible nightmares. I see people that I love dying, upset, leaving me, or humiliating me. I feel like trash all the time, I'm tired, I'm paranoid, and I'm afraid that the nightmares will come true or I'll do something stupid because of them. The reason I'm afraid that they'll come true is because of how *plausible* they are.It's freaking me out and I don't even want to go to sleep. I'm sorry, I just needed to vent.(P.S. If you got the reference I made in the title, you're a cool human)
NotSignal	i don't know if this is the right word but you ever get it like a silly really good mood when you are overtired. I know this is gonna fuck me up tommorow but idc
NotSignal	I can't sleep. I just cannot shut my brain down and I want to run and do something I know I'll regret. Every moment, every event over the last few days playing over and over again in my head. I want to be upset. I want to be sad...most of all I'd like to sleep. I can't figure what I did. Someone mad at me for what they did...I just don't understand.So, it's 5:05am. I'm outside smoking a cigarette... contemplating something that is just beyond me.I need answers, I don't know why...I don't know why I need these things. I guess I need closure. I need something other than what's in my head.Humming...if I quiet my brain it just hums...I can't sleep.
Signal	Hello everyone. I have long suffered from early awakenings. I wanted to try the "melatonin retard" that was in my mother-in-law's house without much conviction. Each pill 1 mg. I have found that it has the same effect as antihistamine, that is, it keeps my brain off at the first awakening and I can get some sleep back. The problem is that even during the day I feel heavy-headed, I feel a little detached from things. Tonight I suspended it and this morning my head came free again even though I lost sleep since half past five. But is it normal for melatonin to "knock down" this way? Wasn't it supposed to be a "natural" remedy since it is naturally produced by the body?
NotSignal	So 3 nights in a row now I go to sleep only when I'm really tired, I then quite quickly fall asleep, but then I wake up 5-6h later and although I still feel like I need more sleep, I'm unable to fall back into deep sleep and just get stuck in this pre-sleep state for like 2h before I give up and get out of bed.Any ideas? All my sleep issues started this week, prior to that I had no problems getting as much sleep as I wanted - be that 6h or 8h or 10h.
Signal	Thanks anxiety and insomnia for keeping me up all night. Can’t wait to have a migraine all day today. Ugh when will this just stop already. I so tired for not sleeping or getting really poor quality sleep when I do finally sleep.
Signal	I did a quick search before deciding to post this. I noticed every few days someone asks about the best medication for sleep. Has anyone compiled a list of all commonly prescribed medications for insomnia? I'm a 45 year old male. I've had insomnia in some form for as long as I can remember. I've tried ambien, halcyon, xanax, and a few others. I just weaned myself off of Xanax. I'm trying to find a long term solution. I've also tried meditation and relaxation techniques. I saw a psychiatrist who gave me antidepressants. I personally don't think I was depressed, but they were convinced my insomnia was connected to depression somehow. I also did a sleep study and they concluded I have apnea (2 times per hour) I'm still having trouble falling asleep and I'm going to see a new doctor soon. What if any long term medications have you guys tried that works?
Signal	It's really hot where I live, and the house is always cracking because of the heat. Including the cealing. So yeah, for some reason I thought It was going to fall and smash me in my bed, so I didn't sleep much and now I'm really tired
NotSignal	When it’s time to sleep, I want to paint, I want to watch movies, I want to clean, I want to play games. I can feel my body being extremely tired, my eyes are sore and droopy, but my brain is searching for stimulation. If I try to sleep I feel like my brain is freaking out saying “no, we have to do something”. I get a wave of anxiety if my brain is not being stimulated. Instead of going to sleep, I have been just waiting until my I black out from sleep deprivation.
Signal	Disclaimer: this post is for folks who have reached the point of anxiety-fueled/chronic insomnia. It might not be for everyone!Anyway...I'm sure you have seen the "helpful" posts about National Sleep Week this week and all the benefits of sleep... I know that reading them I was brought back to some of my darkest days with insomnia.That made me realize I finally feel confident enough to share what worked for me. I'm here to tell you that you can get through this. I'm not a doctor, and hope that everyone suffering with insomnia is ruling out medical conditions with the help of a professional. In 2017 I was at the lowest point of my life. I was sleeping fitfully for maybe 1-2 hours total a night and hammered with anxious thoughts in the daytime. I had every awful sleep experience in the book: auditory hallucinations, hypnagogic hallucinations, exploding head syndrome, panic and depersonalization. I spent my honeymoon in Santorini in an adrenaline/cortisol fog and barely slept. Sleep occupied every inch of real estate in my mind... and I was trying every quick fix I could get my hands on to make it go away: ambien, benedryl, benzos, and even things like reiki and crystals (which is SO not me). I started to avoid major events and gatherings. I knew something had to change.Here are the top things that helped for me. Some of these are totally impractical for some, but I will start with those that are free to all:***Acceptance and Commitment (ACT) Approach***: In therapy, two common tactics are CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and ACT. I tried reading books and working with a CBD shrink, but I found that the positive self-talk just seemed to clash with my insomnia and make my insomnia seem like an even bigger enemy. Acceptance was at the core of my recovery. Here's how to apply it:* **Label your symptoms:** As you try to go to sleep, acknowledge the unpleasant sensations. "Hello, racing heart. Hi weird stomach pain. Welcome racing thoughts." The more you avoid these sensations, the more powerful they become.* **Label your feelings**: This is a key tenant of mindfulness. You are not your thoughts or feelings. When you have a scary thought, just say something like "hello thought." Or, "thank you, mind." Or simply, "thinking."* **Use visuals**: Some people like to picture their anxiety like a silly looking monster who tags along next to them. In the book, *The Sleep Book*, the author suggests to imagine yourself as a teacher a classroom with all sorts of silly characters coming in, representing your feelings and symptoms. You greet them, sit with them, and just let them be.* **Meet the pain head-on. Challenge it to do its worst**. Maybe a mindfulness approach isn't enough for you. In his book, *DARE*, Barry McDonagh suggests to challenge your anxiety to do it's worst. You can picture yourself yelling "come get me! I dare you!" (I suppose you could also do it out loud too ;) Challenge your anxiety head on instead of hiding from it.* **Accept some suffering to make progress**: With ACT, you're going to have several, or many nights, of suffering through the unpleasant feelings and thoughts. AND the key is to just *exist* while you go through them (don't get out of bed, don't watch tv, don't scroll through instagram). But you'll notice they'll start to diminish in power. And, one day, they'll be almost gone.***"Do it anyway."**** When you have a night of terrible sleep, it's tempting to decline all your plans the next day, call in sick to work, and avoid, avoid, avoid. * I would challenge you to go anyway within the limits of safety. You might think you make no sense in conversations. You might feel like you're going to collapse. But, you likely won't. And the more you show up, the less power anxiety/insomnia take from you. ***Read good books.**** These three books have changed my life and are just one library card away to most: 1. DARE (Barry McDonagh) - more geared towards panic, but uses an ACT approach2. 10% Happier (Dan Harris) - again geared towards panic/GAD but great pragmatic approach to mindfulness3. The Sleep Book (Guy Meadows) - ACT-based insomnia bible!***Stay away from forums.**** While I hope this post helps, I have found that reassurance-seeking in forums is a net negative. For example, I would read about someone else's symptoms and start to spiral into worry about whether or not I would experience them. If you can, focus as much as you can on day to day tasks, or use the time you'd spend here meditating or practicing mindfulness.Now, the less practical things, that I have been privileged enough to experience:***Work with a professional:**** I needed a little help to apply the ACT principles to my personal circumstances. I found a great Psychiatrist through PsychologyToday's listings and she created an action plan for me based around mindfulness and acceptance.***Invest in the Calm app.**** The Calm app is $60 USD/year and a great investment IMO. They have a range of meditations that can help introduce basic concepts of mindfulness, and meditation programs focused on anxiety, sleep, work stress, and more.***Get a pet!**** OK, I realize this is the least practical advice EVER. But my dog has changed my life in so many ways. He was always there for a cuddle when I woke up and just brought boundless joy and PLAY into my life. He made me go outside everyday and get fresh air. Pets FTW.P.S. a silver lining for us insomniacs. If you don't have kids yet, the newborn phase will be a piece of cake. We're no strangers to 2, 3, 4, and 5am! I had my first child last year and I will say my insomniac past finally paid dividends. Good luck everyone. <3
Signal	I’ve been tired, fatigued and my head has been hurting, and I haven’t been able to think clearly every day for years. I can almost never sleep, and when I do it takes me 2 hours to fall asleep, and I’m not even rested in the morning. I don’t know what to do anymore
NotSignal	Does anyone have this? I don’t know if it’s hot flashes or panic attacks.
Signal	Debuting on Reddit with a post about my story with insomnia; normally I'm a hyper-private person and don't enjoy attention, but I guess it's going to be fun exchanging experiences with the community :)I'm 42 and I've always had insomnia, even as a child I would sleep very little and that just never changed as I grew up. As a teenager, at least I'd fall into a coma, however short, and bombs dropping around me couldn't wake me up, but that changed as years passed, and now a neighbour sneezing on the other side of the wall will startle me awake. If left to my own devices, I will maybe get two-ish hours of half-arsed napping, but I've been on ambien for the past five years straight without interruption and to be fair it kinda helps securing a few more hours, although the quality of my sleep still is rather poor.My insomnia is at least partially congenital, but it also probably stems from anxiety induced by a very abusive family: night time used to be the only time I would be at peace when I was a kid, and I probably made a habit of clinging on to every hour of respite I could get. The "sleeping=wasting time" mindset has obviously bled into my adult life as well.I don't perceive my insomnia as an ailment, though: I don't really know any other sleeping pattern, plus I have learnt to put it to good use, e.g. by being able to safely take long drives at night if needed, reading or studying or simply binging on Netflix for longer than most people, and so on.Anyone with similar experiences? :)Thanks for reading this far, I hope this made you feel less alone, whatever your sleeping pattern may be 💙
NotSignal	Hey. For the past month or so I’ve been having real problems sleeping. I’ve been staying off my phone before bed (apart from now at 3:15am...), I don’t eat big meals or any food before bed, anything else you can think of. You name it, I do it. I feel once I’m into a sleeping pattern it’ll be fine, so I would like to get some sleeping pills. I don’t really know how to do this. For context, I’m an student in the UK. I don’t want to make an appointment with a GP, I just want a weeks worth of sleeping aid over-the-counter. Unfortunately I have no idea how to get this, what’s involved, or how much it is. For all I know it could be walking into Boots or anywhere, paying a tenner and leaving, or it could be having to go for a consultation and paying 50 quid. Any help would would be really appreciated, I don’t know what’s involved or what to do. Thank you.
Signal	For those who wake up every 2 hours how you manage? I’m getting so frustrated
NotSignal	I honestly don't know how to describe it. My mind just "feels" loose, inconsistent, fast paced etc. Staying on topic is much harder, but not impossible. When I interact with human beings like myself I am able to look in their eyes and talk to them in a friendly manner. However, my mind started to produce some weird abstract thoughts, that cannot be put in words. I try to describe it, so you get an idea of what I'm trying to point out: A sudden thought shows up in your mind. It is a weird one like "why have I never seen elephants cough" or "What if tabasco sauce is actually made out of blood". It's not only graphic, but sometimes I zone out and forget what I am talking about. When you are awake for so long, you don't really perceive yourself as crazy, but deep down in my mind I am aware of the strange things that occur in my mind. It's just that I kind of adapt to these weird thoughts, and my concern is: Can you become insane by not sleeping enough?? Furthermore, can sleep deprivation induced insanity be cured by a following pattern of healthy sleep? Apart from that it would be interesting if some of you could describe your experiences with involuntary staying awake for such a long time. Thank you and good night.Please. I am serious, this is not a troll. I am totally aware of the fact, that this text will seem rather weird or "troll"-like, but honestly, I could understand that.
Signal	Hey, I am currently taking Seroquel for sleep issues. Started at 200mg back in July but have weaned down to 112mg now. Trying to quit it because fuck taking an antipsychotic to sleep and fuck medication in general, for myself personally. First started taking it b/c sleep was awful, laying there for 7 hours not sure if I was awake or asleep. Never felt restorative. The Seroquel doesn't help much but now I think I wouldn't lose consciousness without it, even if it doesn't keep me down for long. Do you think I have developed a dependency? I want to try not taking it for a few nights and see if I get to sleep, but kinda scared I won't.I have been trying CBTi on my own, and I think it has helped despite the complication of weaning off Seroquel. CBTi is also the reason I go to sleep so late, prescribed bed time and all that.The past month sleep vastly improved, except for a few shitty nights here and there whenever would I cut the dose of Seroquel down. I take it at 10PM and I generally sleep from 12AM-6:20AM. I fall asleep in 10-20 minutes, depending on how much my mind is racing that night. Maybe waking up one time during the night with it taking about 20 minutes to go back to sleep.Yet I never feel rested in the morning. I pretty much get out of bed, and go lay down in a conscious but exhausted state for 2 or 3 hours, until I am sick of myself for acting lazy and force myself to start the day. A few weeks ago I used to be able to fall asleep again during this time, but not lately.For the past 2 weeks, my partner has been waking up early. They say they haven't been sleeping well, but they are passed out in bed by 9PM most nights. They start tossing and turning and I guess around 5:30, so my sleep is light enough at that point that the movement wakes me up. Then they start "cuddling" me which involves grabbing my hips and adjusting positions every minute. I can sleep through someone holding me, but not moving positions constantly. This puts me at waking up almost an hour earlier than I was a couple weeks ago. I'm afraid if my partner keeps up with this, it's just going to become a pattern where I wake up at 5:30AM now instead of 6:20AM. But if I tell my partner to not do that, it's going to hurt my relationship. I can try to take the Seroquel earlier and go to sleep earlier to accommodate the early waking, but I really don't want to mess with the bedtime so early in the CBTi process. I also just don't want to be awake at 5:30AM. I have mental health issues and being asleep as late in the morning is a nice escape as I just feel worse in the morning. This shit is so frustrating!!!
NotSignal	Hi. I am 29y old man. Sorry for my english i am from europe. Last month started problems with sleep. I start woking up at 2-3 am and could fall asleep for 1-1and 1/2 hour. Then i started waking up 2-3times at night. Last night was hell, i got to bed at 22pm and woke up at midnight and couldnt sleep all nignt, probably i fall asleep for few minutes but i remember each hour on my mobile phone 1,2,3pm...I do take madicatiob on my rheumatics problem. And doctors gave my more medication on my stomach. I am also stressed out, but only from how i cant sleep. Also i didnt feel too much tired, and i sleeped probably for 3-4 hours together.
NotSignal	Basically the title. After 2 weeks thinking that my insomnia had worsen, I realized that I'm actually having paradoxical insomnia. I don't know if I'm relieved or not. It's good to know that I am actually sleeping even when I think I'm not, but it's scary to wake up feeling like you have just stared at the ceiling for hours on end. Also witnessing the sunrise every morning is not fun. I used to dread sleep because I was scared of not falling asleep but now I dread sleep because I'll fall asleep without having any memory of it... I'm still not sleeping 7 or 8 hours but I can manage a good 5 or 6 hours fragmented sleep? My ''final'' wake up is usually between 430 and 530 am and then I get up and go back to sleep between 6 and 630 am but it takes 45 mins to an hour to fall asleep and only THEN I can experience dreams and waking up feeling like I've actually slept and such. I never sleep later than 9am So yeah, I'm wondering if applying the basics CBT-i principles would cure my paradoxical insomnia and also increase the number of hours that I sleep?
Signal	I don’t know why but is like 2/3 months I’m suffering of insomnia. Every night I can’t fall asleep because I’ve too many thoughts in my head and I can’t sleep because I keep focusing on them too much. Is impossible to drive away my attention, I’ve tried with music, reading, even drawing, but I can’t focus on something else and I’m getting depressed for that. Another feeling is loneliness, I can’t figure out why I feel so lonely if every day I talk a lot with my friends or hang out with them twice a week. That’s it, I can’t explain more about my situation and my feels, I’m a bit scared about this situation.
Signal	It all started because I had a lot of work, due to that I was able only to sleep for about 4 hours a day. Sometimes during the weekdays I'd sleep 2-3 hours max and then on Saturday I'd literally collapse and sleep all day(about 16-19 hours).Last year it got better, about 6 hours each day with no oversleeping during the weekends.The last 3 months have been terrible. To fall asleep it could take me from 10 minutes to 6 hours, without doing anything else. Simply staying in bed with eyes closed, trying not to think of anything.I'd usually sleep around 3 am and then I'd have to wake up at 6 for work.The dark circles under the eyes have become severely noticeable. And lately I'm not able to concentrate at what I'm doing.It really angers me that I'm not able to do my job sufficiently. And I don't know how long this is going to last.I do not drink coffee or tea. And I have a healthy diet.If anyone has any tips on how to sleep faster I would be very grateful. Thanks!
NotSignal	I have been going to sleep around 4 AM for a while, but last night I went to sleep at 1! I’m so happy, my next goal is to get to sleep at midnight.
Signal	Well, here we go.I’ve been an insomniac my entire life. From birth until today (38 years old). It’s torturous, it’s lonesome, it’s misunderstood, and it’s also kind of interesting (see below). As an infant, I slept 4 hours per day/night. Your average infant sleeps 16 hours per day/night. When I was a bit older (3-12), I would go to bed at 9 pm (the same time as my parents). At 2 am I was WIDE AWAKE. I would wake my parents up, excited to start the new day, and they (obviously) weren’t thrilled, since they are normal and were mid-sleep. I didn’t get it. As a teenager, I slept a tiny bit more- midnight to 6 am. No sleep meds from my doctor, despite frequent requests/pleas- this disorder just was not something that he was familiar with. I couldn’t even get any over-the-counter drugs- Tylenol pm (or similar) did not exist at that time. Insomnia was just not a thing in the 90s.College? Forget it. I worked 40 hours per week and went to school full-time. Insomnia actually helped me out here, because I didn’t need to rest, I needed to work and study. Regardless, at that time, I was concerned, exhausted, and I participated in two sleep studies. Both diagnosed me with type 3, chronic, lifelong insomnia: “This is how it is, I’m so sorry, but we have nothing for you.” Law school- same.Fitbit data since then- horrifying. Averaging less than 20 minutes of REM sleep per night. Working 60-80 hours per week currently. I sleep 2-3 hours per night. Every other weekend, I power down for about 18 hours. If I don’t get that time, I get sick, angry, and shitty to the people around me. So I have to control a lot to make those 18 hours happen. I haven’t been able to make those 18 hours happen for three weeks now, and I’m hitting a wall.I’m not sure why I’m posting all of this, to be honest- I guess that after a lifetime of being tired, I am finally EXHAUSTED, and just needed to share.
NotSignal	I'm fuckin dying out here. I'm in so much pain all the time and it's never going to get better, and the prospect of living the rest of my life like this feels like I'm standing in front of a building-sized cinder block that I can't get through, can't get around. I'm trapped in this miserable fucked up body and there's no way to escape from it. I want to scream, but no one will hear me anyway. This fucking sucks.
Signal	Every time I slow down my breathing and am ready to sleep my body starts freaking out.In fact I got a full blown panic attack once this way a few days ago and it was very intense. Benzos obviously help this but I can’t take them every night. I’m on Zoloft but only just started it 5 days ago so it hasn’t built up yet and not sure of it will work. Anyone experience something similar? Gonna speak with a neurologist tomorrow on this.
Signal	Hello, I recently developed insomnia and have slept for 1-4 hours of sleep the past week and no matter how tired I am I still can’t fall asleep and stay asleep. Nothing particular has happened to me so I’m wondering why it is happening? Also, is 1-4 hours of sleep livable? I have terrible anxiety and can’t stop thinking that I’m gonna die or fall into a psychotic state on this much sleep.
NotSignal	The only thing I want is to fall asleep before 5am. I’ve resorted to alcohol tonight. I know that’s not great but I really want some sleep and I don’t plan on doing this all the time.
Signal	Does anyone else suffer from this? I start to pace the house, grumble to myself, and whine in a very childlike manner. It's very distressing to me. I suffer from bipolar disorder and severe anxiety, so staying up majority of the night is nothing new, but these feelings are. But lately, it's been getting harder to control. I get more angry and stressed. If it's bad enough, and I'm not tired anyway, I just opt to stay up... and sometimes that lasts for 24-40 hours. At least that way I calm down, even if I'm sleep deprived from it. I do what I can to calm down; all the usual stuff... white noise, warm baths, meds, routine, etc. Even if my body's relaxed, my head never is. The weirdest thing is... it doesn't seem to be from any particular trigger. I don't suffer from nightmares and I sleep quite soundly once I'm down. Getting up is a beast though. The one thing I do think is the trigger, is that I got married almost 2 years ago and my husband is an early bird while I'm a night owl. It does seem like that once he's asleep, it starts. What's even weirder (or more primal to me) is that we're sleep in shifts. I'm wide awake when he's asleep and sleepy when he's getting up. It's annoying af.But otherwise, does anyone else get these feelings? And if so, how do you deal with them? Thank you in advance.
NotSignal	I'm experiencing insomnia since like 4 years back when I used to work on a company that required night shifts to be done from time to time that made me use inhuman amounts of caffeine in tablets to get the work done. Now I'm in a work I love where the stress is low so I stopped doing caffeine about a year ago but the problem has worsened a lot, now I can't get to sleep before 2 a.m. and can't sleep for more than 2 hours straight. Tried some over the counter antidepressants and natural remedies with no results. Would appreciate advice if any of you had a similar situation. Many thanks 👍
Signal	Going be a long lost I’m sorry!! As I’m typing I’m trying to make it shorter. Also sorry if it’s all over the place, I’m also on mobile apologizing for format early :) I tried to move what I originally wrote around, if you’d like to read about the psychiatrist who almost me be go absolutely nuts it’s below the main question/rant 😂 I’ll happily answer any questions anyone has!! To start I’ll say this : 👉🗯‼️‼️HERES MY QUESTION, sorry for all the background info below, it just may answer questions or create more!‼️‼️🗯👈WHAT MEDS I HAVENT MENTIONED BELOW HAVE YOU TRIED (for sleep, or anxiety if it helped you sleep)/ what have worked / what hasn’t? And any other tips are appreciated. I’ll try and reply to anyone who takes the time to help here or in my inbox if you don’t want to share anything personal. I luckily have built a great relationship with my GP, I’ve always been completely honest with her even if I knew she wouldn’t be happy lol she’s asked me to try the Valium zop combo + Effexor for two weeks and check in then (which I will,she’s the doctor so I listen) but she also asked me to do some research on other sleeping meds that I think could work and then we can discuss if any could help me/be right for me or harm me in the short or long term. Ok so here we go the long post from my frantic insomniac brain :) ❤️ For just about 2 years I don’t sleep every night, it’s every 4-6 nights consistently no sleep at all not even 30min. Meaning I don’t sleep for between 4-6days. When I do fall asleep though, doesn’t matter if it’s a 5 min sleep or 8 hours when I wake up the my body thinks its had a full rest and the no sleep cycle restarts again. (I’ve had insomnia since puberty but never like this) ▪️example:I had been up for days and was on my way home from a road trip(in passenger seat NOT DRIVING) and I guess the nice motion of driving made me fell asleep. Well my boyfriend not knowing how serious of a sleep problem I have woke me up to ask if I wanted a drink (I wasn’t thirsty and wasn’t mad because he didn’t know how bad it was) but I had only been asleep for 1.5 hours. My body took that 1.5 hours as full rest and the no sleep cycle has started again and since it’s almost 7am as I’m typing this, that’s 6 nights no sleep onto day 7 no sleep) Usually when I finally sleep after x amount of days, I sleep for 10-14 hours. I’ve seen my doc(GP) aug 11th and a psychiatrist months ago, explaination why below(he was useless, and said awful things to me *written below in the crooked psychiatrist section lol*, when I’m ready to try again I’ll search for a new psych) But LUCKILY my GP was able to speak with my partner and he explained how I legitimately do not sleep even an hour during the massive insomnia bouts. ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️💛🗯may want to start reading again here if you’re still reading 🗯💛Just wanna start with if my GP and her receptionist hadn’t taken me a seriously or taken the time to listen fully for the first time, I’d have killed myself 100%💘❤️My insomnia has gotten out of control. I practice extremely good sleep hygiene and I finally called my GP having a full on panic attack on the 11th. I hadn’t slept in so long I was unable to eat, brushing everywhere for no reason and constantly vomiting and I had/still kind of have 0 control over my emotions. What should make me happy makes me yell and what should make me yell makes me laugh. She prescribed me an original dose of 10mg Valium but if needed I could take 20mg and the max dose of zopiclone (15mg) Valium as needed/zops at night with the option to mix the zoo and Valium. She also added Effexor to see if it would help after cipralex made me want to kill everyone and Zoloft seemed to have no effect. But the Valium/zop mix isn’t working. It worked the first night after 25-30mg Valium,can’t remember exactly) and 15mg zops and I slept from about 1am till 4pm it was glorious!(the 11th because I was so exhausted and malnourished I just needed sleep) but Im struggling falling asleep and staying asleep on day 2 of taking the meds. like I mentioned at the top, and it being 740am my time i feel like I got that one night of sleep and even with pills,even taking more of them I’ll get no sleep at all for 4-6 days. I have no intentions of trying to get high on Valium or zops, or taking anymore than i already have, I have weed and shatter for getting buzzed I just want to be able to relax for 10 min and sleep for 4 hours straight. When I took the zop + trazadone mixture in the past I defs slept but for upwards of 12 hours because of the trazadone so that doesn’t work. I was also taking the propanolol with just trazadone for about 2 weeks but it didn’t help me sleep it just slowed my heart down to where I wasn’t sure it was beating 😂🔶I am 99% sure my insomnia is now related to uncontrollable anxiety/ptsd from a past relationship/awful childhoodI know I NEED type of therapy, pills won’t fix me forever, maybe not at all. But the experience I had with the psychiatrist was awful and I’m not in the right mind frame to try any kind of therapy currently, I’ll just scream. I want to find a new psychiatrist asap but id like my anxiety 5-10% under control so I’m able to sit there and talk without screaming/crying or just leaving.. I want the help, at 27 I’m finally ready for the help and go listen and take the advice of the professionals, but only the ones that are going to keep their follow ups and not be condescending. I’ll get over it soon and begin the hunt :)Sleeping issues :I have MAJOR issues falling asleep, 50% of the time if I can get to sleep I’ll stay sleeping but the other 50% I’m awake every hour or two, sometimes more. If I continue to push myself to fall asleep I will relive really awful flash backs, it’s like my body knows it’s getting into bed but it knows it can’t sleep so it causes massive ptsd like symptoms in me. I also have only had dream since I was 19, I’m 27 now it’s always the same and it’s a bit scary I don’t know if it matters. I’m doing my search online at sleeping meds, but I’m just looking for personal experiences. Like I said, I have a GP who is on my side and understands how seriously my sleep problem is so plz don’t tell me to go to a doctor. Addictive meds are ok for now, no opioids though. I have built trust with my doctor that I can have a benzo or a muscle relaxant and not abuse them, they don’t even get my high anyways I have too much anxiety 😂 so after a lot of honesty and crying with my doc she’s ready to help me as much as she can until we together find the right psych for me. _____________________________________________________🔸🔳🔲ABOUT THE CROOKED PSYCHIATRIST/skip if you want 👉👇#1 THIS PSYCHIATRIST WASNT CHOSEN BY ME OR REFERRED BY MY DOC! My family chose him(why they did 2 paragraphs down) and said they’d pay(this guy is free with Canadian health care) so nice gesture but a little redundant #2 I just didn’t want to argue so I waited the unbelievable period of time(9.5months) to see the asshole (suffering horribly the whole wait)-I should add I have uncontrollable anxiety, I live at a 9/10 all the time no matter the situation, that’s why I saw the psych, my GP understandably said my issues were out of her realm of knowledge but she would support me always. (the insomnia and anxiety are separate issues, they didn’t start at the same time but now they probably fuel each other.) I’m guessing this is why he said nothing (meds or therapy) would help. If you can catch your anxiety and try and control it before it’s a 5/10 or more then it’s a lost cause according to him. I’m guessing this is why he said nothing (meds or therapy) would help, I’m constantly way over a 5. -How This Psych was chosen🔶🔸—> My grandparents best friends have a grandson who was also a heroin addict and he was seeing this highly recommend psych near where I moved. Sort of a big difference here, he was supported completely during recovery/detox (I mean emotionally learnt coping skills etc, I don’t know their financial situation) I was also addicted to heroin, but I got clean cold turkey locked up in a room by myself completely with no support from anyone so I hold some resentment to my family, never asked them for money or a place to stay I just asked for emotional support.-My grandparents friends wouldn’t stop going on about how fantastic this therapist was because he was helping the above mentioned addict keep his life together. So because of the great reviews from parents(who may know more about addiction than mine but still not the facts) of an addict (not an actual patient) they decided that’s who I would see, after waiting 8-9 months, that was his wait list, knowing not a single thing about addiction and what works for one may cause the other to run away from help. -Of course read all his online reviews, mostly positive, but some extremely negative and I can see why. He is a straightforward honest guy who won’t bullshit you. The kind of therapist you see at the closing end of your therapy. (occupational psychiatrist maybe? I can’t remember) I am at the start of my therapy journey, I’m still not even sure I trust the process 😂 so if my fam had listened to me things maybe could have been different. BUT- I think he also forgets he’s speaking to highly anxious people/extremely depressed people and while expressing the truth is medically necessary, there should be some techniques known my psychiatrists to speak to people like myself without making us panic. -He made me feel 500x worse and hopeless than I did going in. After speaking for under 10 min(including intro time, going over previous meds-which he barely did- he said WORD FOR WORD :your anxiety is so severe no medication or therapy will ever help you” and said I need to spend 2 weeks being monitored in a special kind of house to see how bad my anxiety really is? I was livid to say the least. I felt completely insulted and not taken seriously. Taking 2 weeks off to go spend time in a house being watched by someone who doesn’t know me or my anxiety doesn’t sound diagnostically beneficial. -So after hearing all that news within a few minutes, As I’m still trying to process everything with no discussion he cut me off every sleeping med I had instantly and my Ativan and my SSRI (all of which was prescribed by the head of psychiatry at a hospital in my home town) he refused refused to prescribe even small dose Ativan/clonazepam/zopiclone to help how awful I’d be feeling as i had been on my original script for almost a year and prescribed me 2 off label anxiety meds that did nothing(topamax,FANTASTIC FOR MIGRAINES/headaches but absolutely crap for anxiety + propanolol - sorry but how do you take a pill 15 min before an anxiety attack. If I had a 15 min warning I wouldn’t be in the position I am right now?) We agreed I would try his way and I booked a follow up appointment 8 weeks later. The meds he prescribed off label did not make anything worse, but they didn’t make anything better. I became more uncontrollably anxious, unable to leave the house or take care of myself, and began getting very mad at those closest to me who were trying to help, especially my boyfriend I can be awful when the anxiety and sleep deprivation hit. I started calling the office about my appointment 7 days before it (because COVID had started, I didn’t know if he did in person still or just over the phone). The second day of calling, I found out that my grandparents friends son had over dosed and died, which was tragic after all the work he’d done. I called everyday leaving messages, the phone was never answered and no message was ever returned. 🔸If he’s taking a break from practicing I understand completely, it can’t be hard to lose a patient but honestly he almost lost another one and could lose more by not giving access to refills for what he prescribed.🔶 he is a doctor with responsibility and patients who could be mentally unstable. An email/call by the receptionist)could have informed all us patients with booked appointments they’d need to be moved would have sufficed, (even if they just called all the patients for the next day everyday they’d eventually catch up, there’s many systems that could work$ or even to offer to fax prescriptions that will be needed so no ones off their meds but instead it’s like he left the planet and myself and others don’t have the meds we need. i had no say in what therapist I saw, I live in Canada most are covered, but at this point I’ll pay for help no problem* 🔲🔳🔸TL/DR- insane insomnia, incompetent psychiatrist that screwed me + prescriptions I’ve tried- I’m asking what sleep meds worked well for you and why or what didn’t work? I talk about anxiety a lot, but I have the Valium for now but I feel the anxiety will get better once I sleep more than once a week -doesn’t matter if they are an addictive sleeping pill, it will come from my doctor who will know how to handle the tapering down when I get into therapy and start getting better hopefully. 😂THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ANYONE WHO READ ALL MY SCATTER BRAINED THOUGHTS YOURE SO KIND!!Ok also call me out on any typos or spelling mistakes so I can fix them! it’s 7:23am after no sleep :)
NotSignal	Hello. Today I got my hands on 5mg melatonin tablets. I was wondering what your experiences with melatonin are and how you felt after taking melatonin.Thank you in advance :-)
Signal	Over the course of January i have been through 4 different sleep meds and none are working, i cant fall asleep at all on my own last night even after 2 seroquel i was still awake and even though i got more tired throughout the night if i even dosed off alittle i would just wake up. I dont know what's wrong with me, are there any other meds i could try?
NotSignal	I’ve rarely ever stayed up so long and I just feel a tiny bit tired. I should probably cut back on the caffeine but I need it. Also, nights are depressing.
NotSignal	I seem to have no problem falling asleep on the couch watching TV, but then when I move to my bedroom I have a hard time getting back to it.
Signal	I had sleeping problems in my early teens. I was on medications for a few years and stopped around 16 because my new doctor would listen to my complains about the medication and refused to switch it, only raise or lower the dose. Now I’m two weeks from 19, and I’m dealing with insomnia again but it’s worse than it has ever been. I will lay down around 11-11:30pm in the dark and be tossing and turning for HOURS. I’ll get up to go to the bathroom and check the time just to see that its 4-6am and I have no option to wonder if it’s worth it to even bother trying to sleep anymore. My days aren’t busy or stressful. I’m not on any new meds, I can’t think for the life of me why I’m struggling to sleep. I’ve tried melatonin pills and the liquid, Ive tried just straight diphenhydramine (the ingredient in Benadryl that makes you sleepy). I just don’t know what to do anymore. I haven’t changed locations majorly recently. When I moved to college, I was able to fall asleep easily within 3 days. I’ve had the same sleep routine (shower, get a snack, brush teeth, listen to calm music, play white noise while laying in bed) for years and it’s always worked except for now. I have a doctor appointment tomorrow for a general check up with my primary care physician. She is able to prescribe me medication. Should I bring up my sleeping problems to her and ask if she can give me something stronger for it, or it just not worth it?
NotSignal	Hi I have been sleep deprived for over a month now and I’m starting to believe this will never end. Any advice on this, I’m starting Cognitive behavioral therapy. And I was just wondering if CBD will help. Is there anyone who’s been through insomnia, and what helped fix it?? Also I’ve had bad experiences with marijuana and it actually caused my anxiety, so if cbd is like marijuana I’d rather not take it.
NotSignal	Hi all, just curious if any of you deal with insomnia + paranoia. Usually I can deal with it but lately it has gotten so much worse. Any advice/stories/etc welcome please!
NotSignal	Sorry if this isn't the right sub, because I'm not sure if my issue is considered insomnia or not, but I figured someone here might have a similar experience to me.90% of the time, I can fall asleep within an hour and stay asleep for like 7 hours, so that's okay. But some days, for no reason at all, when I go to bed my heart rate is extremely high and my eyes and my body feel very awake. Those days I will just lie in in bed 4-7 hours wide awake and the high heart rate just doesn't stop, it's so uncomfortable. Is this considered insomnia? Is it a mental or a physical issue? I called the doctor about this and they said come and we will take an EKG test etc. but when I came there they just talked to me, tested my heart rate and said it's normal. The doctor saw in the journal that I have been diagnosed with OCD, wrote "it's just anxiety" and prescribed me anti-anxiety meds, which do work if I take them an hour before going to sleep. When it happens, it means trying to sleep for an hour instead of four.
Signal	I been having problems with sleep over a year. I lost 30 pounds in 3 months and had my eyes and saliva dry out and memory loss. I have vivid dreams all night and fatigue all day have resting heart 100 bpms went to doctors over 20 times done over 100 blood test neurologist endocrinologist, rheumatologist mri they cant seem to diagnose me. When i walk or drive feels like my head is pressure and feel anxious feel like death. This affects my bowels they are metallic smell and now i urinate small amounts frequently no matter how much water i drink every 20 mins i have to sip to keep mouth from dry my bottom lips produces no saliva my sense of taste and smell altered. My muscles are half what they were, and my face pale white i look fatigue face like a zombie no amount of sleep refreshes me. Not sure what the hell to do trying to get a pet scan done and a more recent over night sleep study. I got scared of a prion or sporadic fatal insomnia due to i suffered a rapid weight loss in 3 months of 10kg. I also went 3 nights no sleep at all i started have speech imparement and hoarse voice. Mind you this kicked in September 2017 i was a mortgage executive managing a company i had to quit my job for 9 months i just recently started working from home again and im like struggling to work on computer and talk to clients have no choice my credit got ruined and lost one house thankfully my sister let me move into her house thats empty temporarily. Please help not sure im with kaiser permanente they are not very helpful.
NotSignal	Does any body ever feel this way? For instance the other day around 9am, already at work, I realize I actually slept about an hour. Couldn't sleep all night, look at the clock and it says 6.03am and I think why bother trying now if I gotta be up at 7am. I start thinking about getting ready and the day, next thing I know it's 7.10am, I never slept and it's time to go. But at work I realize I don't remember hearing my roommate leave at 6.30 and I now remember dreaming about getting to work. Oh score so I slept a good hour! Does this make sense? If like your body paused so you could rest but you don't feel it. How often does it happen to you?
NotSignal	I exercised quite vigorously and as a result I cant breath properly at night while sleeping. Every time i take a breath it takes energy and concentration, one that allows me not to sleep. What are the solutions. Its been 30 hours without sleep.
NotSignal	I quit for nine months before, ya withdrawal sucked but honestly it paled in comparison to going days sometimes near a week without sleep, I may have very well went longer IDK, its all a little foggy, but finaly I caved a couple months ago and miraculously could sleep again, witch was great while it lasted and wondered if you guys ever had anything like this before. it was for the entire time it never let up. I tried weighted blankets, music all kinds of different things. only thing I didn't resort to was drugs cause im very wary of them. but am open ears. if you got any advice or really whatever ill listen. forgot to mention I just started another quit again witch is why im concerned because it was pretty fucking miserable last time.
Signal	So I have been struggling with anxiety that is tied to my ADHD for a long time now, and what basically happens is that during the day things are generally fine, but whenever I try to fall asleep I’m not focused on anything my anxiety gets so bad that I end up not being able to sleep for at least 3 hours. This happens every night and I have recently been diagnosed with insomnia, but haven’t had much luck with recovery (idk what you’d call it, really) quite yet. If anyone has any suggestions or advice that could help me I’d really appreciate it, as I am getting less and less sleep thanks to the pandemic and my mental state is at an all time low.
NotSignal	I feel like quarantine completely fucked over my sleep rhythm. I don’t sleep well anymore, meds rarely work anymore and I’m just more tired during the day overall.
Signal	I know the side effect for long term use of Trazadone (I’ve been taking 25 mg nightly for a year) can be headaches but these are definitely tension headaches and I don’t know if by headache they mean an internal headache (rather than in the face and head muscles like with a tension headache). I’m currently maintaining healthy diet and exercise, drinking plenty of water, and sleeping great but that’s cause of the Trazadone haha. I also grind my teeth so that might be the cause of the headaches as well.. would love to hear the thoughts of anyone who might have had a similar experience. Thanks!
Signal	So I have a friend who is like me a person with insomnia so when the whole quarantine started (March) we were talking almost every day for about 6 hours a day at different times but now 4 months later we’re struggling to keep the commitment going because we are running out of topics to talk about. She doesn’t play any games so we only talk and we’re really close and don’t want this relationship go to waste what should I do ? Should I have posted this here or in another sub?
NotSignal	Going through another bad wave lately. One thing I've been noticing is if I CAN get to sleep before 12, I'll wake up between 3-4am fully "rested" according to my brain (can't go back to sleep).But any time after 1am I can sleep like 6 hrs. UghBut tonight is completely sleepless
NotSignal	TL;DR: Since I can remember, I've always been tired during the day. I'm waking up during the middle of the night and am always exhausted in the morning. Blood tests came back normal and I live a decently healthy lifestyle. Any help is extremely appreciated.&#x200B;Ever since I can remember, I've (M20) always been falling asleep during the day. Not spontaneously, but extreme tiredness which leads to falling asleep. Up until I graduated high school, I had thought it was because of my swim schedule (14 practices a week, practices at 5:30 AM, etc.). Now I'm in university with a co-op program, so I get to see how my sleep affects me during school terms, and when I'm working full time for 4 months at a time.I've come to realize that I can fall asleep pretty quickly (<30 minutes usually), but I consistently wake up 2-4 times a night, at least that I can recall. My GF tells me that I move a lot in my sleep and that sometimes I talk in my sleep. I had issues when I was a child with sleep walking, but nothing for about a decade. I keep a relatively consistent sleep schedule and try to get 8-9 hours a night. Working out, have a long day, and getting little (<7 hours) sleep obviously makes me super tired during the day, but my baseline always seems to be consistently low energy for most of the day and I ALWAYS wake up exhausted.I eat pretty healthy foods, mainly grains, fruits, and vegetables, with meat/chicken a few times a week. I'm in decent shape and I try to workout/run a few times a week (although that has dropped since quarantine). I stop drinking coffee after 4 PM and \*try\* to stop using my phone/laptop later in the evening.I talked to my physician about it and she just recommended more sleep. Eventually I got a blood test and everything came back normal. For those wondering, it tested for: WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, Platelet Count, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils, Immature Granulocytes, Nucleated RBC, Vitamin B12, Ferritin, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.I did a sleep study a few months ago. They hooked me up and monitored me all night, but with all the cables, I was afraid to move (in case they came off). They couldn't find anything from their sensors/cameras so that ended that.I don't really know what to do. It really sucks day-to-day, especially when I have to study for exams or get stuff done for work. I'm yawning all day and sleepy to the point where I can't get stuff done. At it's worst, I'm dosing off at the wheel. If anyone has any suggestions, it would mean the world. I've tried to put as much relevant information as I could think of, but let me know if you need more.
NotSignal	As insomniacs, we were meant to be the night watch in our tribes, back when tribes needed a night watch to keep them safe at night. This got me thinking, what does a tribe look for in a good night watch? Some things came to mind:1) **Insomnia/nocturnal disposition**: Obviously the most important trait in a good night watch is that they be naturally disposed to stay awake for as long as possible until sunrise, when the early risers can relieve us.2) **Highly sensitive**. A good night watch must be highly sensitive. Every slightest sound, every glimmer of light, has to easily distract us so that we pay attention to us. This would make us a disaster to function during normal daytime hours, but at night it becomes a superpower that keeps our tribe safe.3) **Loyalty and empathy**. The tribe is trusting us with their lives while they sleep. They can't have a psychopath keeping watch over their lives at night. The night watch must have a strong emotional bond with the tribe, and not be willing to sell them out in secret night time meetings with the enemy.4) **Honesty**. The night watch needs to give a full report of what they see at night. As such, they need to be virtually incapable of lying. The night watch must be direct and brutally honest. Any manipulation by the night watch would have devastating consequences for the tribe.5) **Introversion** The night watch must be comfortable working alone. They must be completely quiet so as not to give away their position to the enemy. The night watch can't be someone who needs to engage in constant chatter in order to keep themselves energized. What other characteristics do you think would make for a good night watch?
Signal	I feel so tired during the day and around maybe 7 or 8, exhausted from lack of sleep the night before, and it feels like I'm going to collapse and be able to easily pass out. But somehow when it comes time to actually sleep I just, can't? I can't turn my brain off it is so fast and so loud. It never used to be like this, I would just lay down and be able to sleep like normal, it isn't supposed to take longer than ten minutes to fall asleep, but it feels like I genuinely can't even remember what falling asleep is supposed to feel like? I lay down and close my eyes and I try to sleep but I just have so many thoughts and I just can't stop thinking and it will take me hours of just laying there to finally fall asleep, and even when I do sleep it doesn't feel like real, genuine sleep- if that makes sense? Just like, surface level, bare minimum sleep. I hate this so much. It is 4am and I just want to go to bed but I've tried and I just can't stop THINKING
NotSignal	Does anyone get really bad heart palpitations from lack of sleep? For the past week Ive slept maybe 1-2 hours a night. Last night i did not sleep at all. And now my heart palpitations wont go away.
Signal	Hi,I have worked in this organization for several years. I applied for more challenging job inside my organization, where you have to work with heavy machinery and climb high places sometimes. You have to be somewhat fresh there.Now that I got selected, it would be starting in one week. I have been depressed and had huge anxiety about this after the selection. I keep thinking about not sleeping before my first shift in this job and being unable to go. I don't want to embarass myself by taking sick leaves first night. I can sleep well if I know I am able to perform next day even if I sleep unwell, but when I have to be fresh I have huge anxiety and sleep issues.I take Quetiapine and Melatonin, but they don't always help.I think this job would be cool and going out of my comfort zone, feel little bit like pushing and trying this, but is it worth the risk? I am fine with my current job, it is pretty boring but I don't get anxious before shifts there. I still have the option to cancel it.
Signal	Sometimes you guys give some good ideas so I'm gonna give it a shot.I've been having bad sleeping problems since late last year. They began suddenly and I didn't have problems before this. I don't feel sleepy no matter what I do during the day. I've tried melatonin, evening walks, no evening snacks, vitamin D, hot showers. Quetiapine helps and if I want to sleep at night then I have to take the pill. Sometimes I try to sleep without meds but nothing happens, not even close to sleeping. I did go 3 nights without sleeping at one point as I was trying to exhaust myself but I really don't want to do it again. Just (about 1 week) before these sleeping problems began I had major surgery done on my leg. The surgery itself went well and there was no complications. Basically leg was rebuilt from the knee up. There was anaesthesia but the doctors cant find any reason why the operation would have started this. I am 29 years old with good physique. I also have diagnosed mild depression but I don't personally believe it's causing this.Next week I will try acupuncture and will try anything else I can think of. I haven't done any blood or other tests yet. Also my therapist said that I should get my thyroid checked.
NotSignal	I’ve really liked “get sleepy” and “sleep cove”, especially the episodes where they just read a story in a soothing voice. Background music is a big plus! Adds to the atmosphere.Thanks in advance!
Signal	I've tried exercise, meditiation, yoga, been doing cbt-i as well as sleep restriction. I've tried melatonin, weed, cbd, and every medication you can think of. I was even hospitalized for 15 days for suicidal ideation caused by this.Started about 6 months ago. I am assuming I'm getting some form of sleep but it's not very deep. I'm hyperaroused the entire time. I'm going to go get my cortisol and hormone levels checked because this is weird now.I have no history or family history of insomnia, but I also feel energized all the time. I don't get tired during the day or night unlike a lot of people with insomnia. I've had my thyroid checked and a CBC. The only thing they haven't checked yet is my cortisol levels.I got into a wreck two days ago and didn't get any sleep. I don't feel tired at all either which is weird. I used to STRUGGLE to stay awake. I would fall asleep at the movies, in my car, and I'd frequently fall asleep while I had my phone in my hand. Wtf gives?
Signal	Took a 5mg melatonin about an hour or two ago and here I am at 3 am still awake. Now i’m pissed because I can’t take another so tonight is fucked. Wish I wasn’t like thissss
Signal	Hi guys, I'm new here and I just really wanted to seek help and thoughts because recently, I wasn't able to sleep at night. I just came from a recent school vacation and I usually stayed up all night the whole duration of that vacation so now I physically can't sleep at night. My mind is battling whether I just shut my goddamn eyes or just don't sleep at all. I know this isn't insomnia or idk but, it's just im so confused and panicking right now because it's literally school night right now while I'm typing this. Also, my parents won't understand things like this so I really can't open up at them(like mostly every problems I have :/ ) So yeah, please tell me what to do because my brain won't stop thinking about every bad possibilities if I don't sleep (I'm so fucking anxious).
NotSignal	It's after 2am. Although my body needs sleep, my brain tells me no
Signal	HI all. Need advice. This is follow-up to post below, c/p below.Had the worst week of sleep in my life, and now just slept for 24 hours straight and feel like I am in a dissociative state. Sitting at a starbucks and am trying to eat a bagel and I can feel and not feel the bagel, the keys on my laptop. I don't know if this bagel is in my hands though it seems to be. Is this normal? Basically, I have a job in which I have to work a week of nights every two months. On Friday I work the day, am off from 5PM through Saturday night at 10:00 PM, and then work from 10PM - 7AM the following week. I usually am a shit show the first two nights, but then readjust. This week was horrible. Sleep:Friday: 3 hrs Saturday: 0 hrs Sunday: 0 hrs Monday: 5 hours Tuesday: 4 hours Wednesday: 0 hours Thursday: 0 hours Friday: 0 hours. Saturday: 24 hours.V ery mystical, somewhat strange, intermittently euphoric dreams, a lot of nature, fantasy of dflight, etc. Woke up with a moderate headache, which was not great but tolerable and Motrin helped. Now feel like I've had a stroke. Is this normal???\------Copy/pasted, two days prior.I probably shouldn’t be posting this in an insomnia sub lest I get told to gtfo, but usually I sleep great. Regular sleep schedule, short sleep latency without a need to actively practice sleep hygiene. If I’m stressed or a bit too awake I take 400mg mag glycinate which sedates me and I’m out.Except, once or twice a month I’m completely sleepless for over 72 hours. It’s the death of the overtired.If I’m awake for over about 22-24 hours for whatever reason, I won’t be able to sleep for the next 48.I can feel the switch, from being sleepy to being not sleepy but fatigued. It happens within an hour. And at that point I know I’m fucked. I won’t be able to sleep that night or the next two nights. 72 hours of torture, physical pain and mental fatigue, inability to think or process anything. Eventually, almost on cue, my body gives out and I’ll finally sleep for a few hours, get just one hit of deeper sleep, wake up feeling kissed by an angel till the cycle repeats a few weeks later.How to fight the overtired. Sleep hygiene/CBT does NOT work. It is a physiologic thing, I can be completely “thoughtless” but will realize an hour later I’m still awake. I’ll get up and do something for an hour, feel exhausted and then try again, I call them “sleep trials.” It will happen when I’m at home on vacation and have nothing to do the next week. When the ovetired hits it hits. Mag does not work. Benadryl does not work. I have yet to try a Benzo, but have obvious reservations.PleAse help. I’m at hour 48 and there’s another 24 to go.
Signal	I'm on 300mg trazodone and sonata. It doesn't work. You'd think by 300mg doctor would give up and prescribe something useful, but no such luck.
NotSignal	My sleep quality has been improving lately but I placed a reed diffuser by my bed yesterday, and last night I woke up a few tines during the night. I also had acid reflux though from eating a curry before bedtime... so maybe this was the cause, instead? I've woken up 3 hours early, too. Just trying to find the culprit. Any ideas? Thanks!
Signal	Been noticing a bunch of people like this recently myself included where they get up after 4 hours like clockwork and cant get back to sleep and if they do its not good sleep(waking up every 30 mins or so). Has anybody who dealt with this problem specifically been able to fix it? If so what were some things. My typical day getting up at 7 to 8am sfter trying to sleep at 12am going to bed, getting up at 3:30 to 4 then getting up at 5:30 then 6 then 6:30 repeat until 7 or 8 where I give up. Eat breakfast, oatmeal with fats with my vitamin d supplement. Hit the exercise bike for an hour or go on a nice walk for a couple of hours. Get home, eat a snack which is usually a clif bar and an orange or banana. Go on the computer for awhile keep moving around when I fan as I go for 20k steps, eat lunch, watch anime, eat dinner couple hours before bed I eat a light snack of almonds or a banana and then head to bed at 12 usually go to sleep easily minus last night where in total i got 3 and a half hours then wake up at 4 try to sleep again takes awhile then wake up every 30 minutes. Lol. Havent changed my schedule at all before my sleeping issues started and have been like this since I was in highschool with 0 issues then I didnt sleep for 6 days was hospitalized and then I started sleeping again after being put on seroquel and zoloft weened off both due to side effects now I think I've been going through withdrawal tried a bunch of sleeping pills like silenor, hydroxyzine, tryptophan, melatonin, but docs refuse to give anything else so I'm sort of stuck. Hydroxyzine gave me 6 hours for one day then stopped working now I'm thinking of trying doxepin but eh
Signal	I'm awake all night then sleep from around 7am-3pm if I'm lucky. I've tried twice to stay awake throughout the day so I can sleep at night, but its not worked and I've ended up feeling even shitter. I usually can't cope on less than 8/9 hours sleep, so only getting 5 or so hours during the day is killing me. I feel so fucking depressed, the days are blending together its so surreal. I've just been reading because I feel too physically exhausted to do much else, but that stimulates my head too much and I struggle turning off. I've read 4 whole books which is insane for me, and I can't tell if its a good or bad thing anymore. I've not seen anyone in 2 weeks I've been stuck on my own, I feel like I'm slowly going insane.
Signal	This is the first time I fell asleep naturally but only for couple of mins and I feel terrible being too tired makes me anxious.
NotSignal	I'm not sure what I'm experiencing can be called insomnia or not. But this lockdown has really messed up my sleep cycle. I'm sleeping at around 5 in the morning. Barely get 5 hours of sleep. Then wake up at 9/10. The whole day goes by while I feel groggy all this time. Once I hear the chirping of the birds outside, I decide to get to the bed. And try to sleep. The cycle repeats itself. I don't how I'll be able to get my circadian rhythm back to normal. Am I the only one in this situation?
NotSignal	Whenever I'm about to sleep, I feel so sleepy and feel like going to sleep but it disappear suddenly. What can I do to avoid this problem and why is that happen all the time?
NotSignal	Hey I am checking in because I am lost what to do. We have a White noise machine, she tried ear plugs but It made her ears hurt really bad. Is there some sort of over ear soft cloth ear plugs or headband that blocks noise but doesn’t need to play music. Thanks everyone!
Signal	I’m always really tired/sleepy, but once I get in bed no matter which bed, I can almost always never fall asleep. I think I know why : I’ve developped such a negative response to sleep that my own brain refuses to let me sleep.I don’t know what to do to make it pass?
NotSignal	I just can’t fall asleep. I keep changing positions and I really need sleep I have an important test tomorrow. HELP
NotSignal	The last 3 days I havent been able to sleep because it feels like I've forgotten how?! I close my eyes and then what? Ive had about 3 hours a night for the last 3 nights, I just don't know what to think when I close my eyes and when I try not to think I'm thinking about really weird stuff for example when I drifted off eventually last night i had a dream about the police, now when I close my eyes im wondering why I can't sleep and my brain is asking if I can move and am I under arrest if not can I move and how do I move and where ... its like im going insane from itMy son is now up so I need to get up i really really hope I can sleep tonight
Signal	I am pregnant (3rd trimester) and was told by my doctor that I could safely take Unisom (25 mg.) for my insomnia that has returned with a vengeance. I took it last night and it wasn’t a good experience: 1) I only stayed asleep after taking it, for about an hour and a half 2) It then brought on my Restless Leg Syndrome 3) I ended up tossing and turning most of the night 4) This morning I woke up feeling like I was really hung-over and felt anxious. Anyone else have any of the above side-effects from Unisom? Just wondering. I did already send a message to my doc about my bad experience and asked about taking an alternative sleep med. But wondering if anyone else had bad experience taking Unisom?
Signal	I mean prescription.From my own experience, I tend to prescribe Xanax and Ambien for insomnia patients. But I know other doctors may have different opinions, and choose other pills.From my patients feedback, combo of xanax and ambien is quite effective to resolve insomnia. Many have been on xanax and ambien for years and are still doing well.Other pills I can think of are:trazodone, sonata, silenor, etcWhat's your favorite sleep pill then?
NotSignal	What is wrong with me?!? I didnt slept a wink didn’t looked at the time and I don’t see the point in trying to sleep anymore since the night’s almost over. I’m hella concerned because I don’t feel sleepy at all and im scared that the lack of sleep won’t hit me ; that i’ll feel good in the morning. It seems like i’ve lost the ability to feel tired/sleepy.
NotSignal	I could probably sleep if I got off my phone...No disrespect lol for many it’s more complicated than this but just my experience atm
Signal	Ugh this is super frustrating. I went to bed at 10PM, took a melatonin and meditated for 50 minutes. Still felt awake so I took half of another melatonin. Because of the meditation I didn’t feel like I was thinking of anything but I was still tossing and turning trying to find a comfortable position to sleep (which I always do). Literally had no thoughts in my head and decided to check the time...1:30am. It’s frustrating because melatonin isn’t even effective anymore. Granted I’ve been going to sleep around 3AM every day for the past week or so so I get that my sleep schedule is messed up but it’s like I’m tired but I can’t sleep. What gives? I didn’t drink coffee past 3:30PM today either although I drank some green tea. Sigh so frustrated that I’ve literally been in bed for 4 hours at this point, haven’t looked at my phone until now and have done everything “right” but still no sleep...
Signal	I have extreme fatigue 24/7 but I can never fall asleep at night. And when I do i wake up multiple times a night..
Signal	I need help turning off my brain at night. I have an overactive brain all the time and suffer from depression, anxiety, bpd. For over 20 years I have dealt with not being able to fall asleep EVERY night. If I don’t take medications I won’t sleep at all for 3 days. I now have intense anxiety at night because I know I can’t sleep. I am at wits end and need some help that I haven’t been able to find from multiple doctors and psychiatrists. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am currently on therapy and working through childhood abuse(where the bpd came from) but there seems to be a switch that won’t turn off. Thanks in advance.
NotSignal	Has anyone here taken sedative antidepressants for years, discontinued them and survived? Has sleep returned at some point?
NotSignal	I tried to fix my messed up sleeping schedule by staying up all night and now I have been trying to fall asleep for about 6 hours. I feel so off I feel like I'm losing my mind
Signal	Hello, it’s really late and I need some nice comforting comments to help me sleep, I would greatly appreciate it. I have episodes of insomnia if my anxiety gets really bad. I sleep for barely a couple of hours throughout the week, and this doesn’t change till maybe a month. It is happening again due to the world events, please send some love ♥️
Signal	How do you deal with the anxiety when waking up in the middle of the night?My CBT-I therapist told me that we are going to focus on the cognitive side because I have trouble sleeping when I wake up in the middle of the night due to the anxiety. He told me a number of things which really helped me but it would be great if you could also advise.Thanks!
NotSignal	Like ffs, don’t you think I’ve tried that. ... I know it shouldn’t make me angry but it just does. They do not understand at all. If all it takes is a routine then when did I do so badly in highschool. Why did I drop out of college multiple times. 🤦🏼‍♀️
NotSignal	I don't know how but I'm still not tired and I have stayed up all night it's 8 am I've been up since 2pm yesterday and this has been going on for a few months
Signal	Finally got a good amount of sleep, I was awake for about 3 days. Oh, I'm expecting it again today. I even tried taking 50 mg of melatonin, NOTHING. But, I'm good now, gonna binge stimulants so I can sleep because they help me sleep when they were off :). Okay I don't know what to say now I'm just really up right now hehehhafb :)
NotSignal	i finally found a meathod that 100% works everytime, ive been doing it for the past 4 days and it has worked within around 15ish minutes. all you have to do is put on Merriweather Post Pavilian by Animal Collective, and just listen to the sounds. your mind will stop running rampid which is what has been effecting me. i would just think about random things, have a conversation with myself and just think about my day, and even if i tried my best to stop, it wouldn’t until now. if this sounds like you please give it a try. start it at a medium volume, and start to lower it as you get calmer and more chilled out, it works trust me. once you listen to the album around 14 days in a row, you will might need to get a new album, it only works when the albums is semi fresh. once you know all of it by heart it gets more difficult to sleep.
Signal	As the title says i’m getting really anxious whenever i am not able to fall asleep for whatever reasons. The main thing that makes my anxiety jump is the consequences of being sleep deprived. I’m worried about starting to hallucinate, having some memory issues and/or getting a migraine. After how much days without sleeping can these things start to appear? Does everyone experience these things due to the lack of sleep? Thanks.
NotSignal	It's close to 4 pm and I've only slept a couple hours since turning into bed nearly 12 hours ago (I work nights so my sleep schedule is all messed up.) I didn't fall asleep until closer to 8, woke up a little after 9, tossed, turned, smoked some, went through social media, played my switch a bit, cried in frustration, finally passed out again a little after moon. It's 3:40 and I'm up yet again. I'm exhausted but I can't sleep. Any pointers on how to get some sleep? That is if you're getting any and not stuck in the same situation as me
NotSignal	So, I have some insomnia and now I'm feeling some rib pain sleeping aside, making hard to feel comfortable. I'm feeling concerning, but it's a hard time to see a doctor (cause Corona)... Any else feels it?
Signal	I am completely lost. Every time I try to go to bed I feel an impending feeling of fucking doom like someone is behind me or I jolt awake . Or I start sleeping and then start thinking about ufos and ghosts and stuff for no fucking reason even if I meditated before. I literally have to drink a glass of wine to go to sleep or else there is no sleep for me. I’m getting fatter and fatter because my sleep is terrible so I crave junk food but then when I try to eat healthy my sleep is even worse at night etc. fuck I’m a 148 pound five foot eight relatively healthy woman at 27. Jesus lord fucking help me I can’t live like this anymore
NotSignal	i have been trying to sleep for 4 days now i get like 4 to 3 hours of sleep daily and stay in my bed trying to get more for like 10 hours and cant sleep everytime i try to close my eyes and sleep i think about last night and say i will not be able to sleep this night because i couldnt last night and then my heart rate sky rockets and then it all happens again this happens to me every few months but this has been the longest and i hate the internet for something when you search things about insomnia you get the idea of the fatal insomnia and this alone is the thing that started it all up for me so anyone here like me ?
Signal	How is it even possible?My insomnia issues developed 4 years ago after an anxiety disorder. But for the first 3 years I wasn't even aware I slept badly, only noticing the fatigue.In the last year my insomnia got worse and worse until I turned to medication. The meds knock me out, I sleep without remembering waking up in the middle of the night, yet the next day I feel utterly terrible, the way I feel after a sleepless night. No doctor has been able to tell me what exactly is wrong, maybe we just don't know enough about the brain.But if someone has suffered a similar situation, I'd love some advice.
Signal	My psych put me on 100mg of zoloft and its fucking me up even more it's for anxiety and insomnia, will this get better?
Signal	I think my body is giving up on me, I’ve been feeling so weak and I can’t even stay asleep for more than 3 hours even if I’m dead tired. Should I just fucking end it all?
Signal	So I accidentally took my vyvance to late yesterday and got 2ish hours of sleep and the whole day i was insanely anxious. Now fast forward tonight melatonin didn’t do crap for me i fell asleep for 3 hours now i have a headache and am nauseous what should i do im scared I won’t ever sleep again
NotSignal	Hello! New here! Do you have any suggestions of over the counter meds that I can buy to help me sleep? I haven't slept in 2 days, but for most of the month I've only been sleeping for at least an hour and its making things super hard for me. I've always had some sleeping issues, but the fact that I have no motivation fro school at all is not making this any easier.
NotSignal	So i ran out of quetiapine and i just am not able to fall asleep. I'm pulling an all-nighter tonight and i'm going to try again tomorrow. My sleep rhythm is on point as far as i know, yesterday i got up at 9 am and went to bed at 12 pm, but i still can't seem to fall asleep without quetiapine. I also am planning to stop with the pills, is there anyone here that has succesfully stopped using quetiapine and went on with proper sleep without pills?
NotSignal	But fuck. 2 hours in bed now, not being able to sleep. I love it. Had this shit for like over almost two years now.
NotSignal	1) I am not going to die from too little sleep.2) I am not going to develop serious health problems from too little sleep.3) I can still do the things I love on little sleep.4) I can still do my job adequately on little sleep.5) My body will rest when it is ready.6) I will survive this.and, last but not least,7) I love myself.
NotSignal	It’s pretty clear to me that I’ve developed insomnia but what is starting to concern me is the fact I haven’t slept for 3 nights straight and I don’t even feel tired. All I do at night is toss and turn with my eyes closed but I haven’t ever reached the sleep state. I’m conscious the whole time and when I give up and get out of bed for the day I don’t even feel tired. At all. Granted I don’t do much during the day other than lounging around. I do have to drive somewhere this morning however but I’m afraid to because I don’t wanna have a sudden “crash” behind the wheel. Is that possible for the sleepiness to come out of nowhere? What exactly is happening? Btw last night before I went to bed I got a weird pang in my head. I couldn’t tell what it was, because it was really sudden and brief but it didn’t feel like a typical wave of tiredness. It felt like some weird vertigo, but more painful. It only lasted a second but now I’m concerned I have actual brain problems, or is that just a common thing with insomnia?
NotSignal	i just pulled my first all nighter for the first time in over 2 weeks. do i feel like shit about it? yes. but um...........after becoming a bit better u learn not to give fucks because if u give fucks u’ll feel bad and we not tryna do that here so yay
Signal	I got it prescribed for my just recent journey with insomnia that lasted 4 days. I also got prescribed oxazepam (tht was before zopiclone, i’m not mixing of course) and hydroxyzine.Thoughts about any of these? I also have some CBD oil capsules and melatonin (1mg with niacin), but I strongly believe melatonin caused my insomnia in the first place (weird, I know, but i would fall into sleep paralysis instead of sleep because of it and i got scared of falling asleep).
NotSignal	I can never sleep until about after 3 or 4 am. And when I wake up in the morning I am not tired at all same goes for all day.
Signal	While I've always had trouble sleeping in(taking 1-2 hrs from hitting the bed to actual sleeping) it's been really bad the last three months. I used to sleep for 8-10 hours and if I woke up I'd usually feel like I could sleep for a couple more hours. During a school project this suddenly changed, I started waking up every hour or so, getting a maximum of 4 hours of sleep a day. Over the course of three months this has reduced to about 2-3 hours max, sometimes nights with no sleep at all. I've been awake for 3+ days sometimes, still not feeling the need to sleep. Don't get me wrong, I feel unhealthy and my body feels tired but I don't get the sleepy feeling in my head if that makes sense.I've spoken to doctors, got recommended sleeping pills which were supposed to knock me out 30 minutes later. 4 hours later I'm still up not feeling a thing. I eat healthy food, regularly exercise and don't feel stressed(except now about not sleeping). I've now scheduled an appointment at a sleep clinic, where they'll analyze my sleep. Unfortunately this is still 30 days away and I can feel and see myself getting unhealthier every day.I've picked up a copy of "Why we sleep" by Matthew Walker and reading all the negative effects sleeping like I currently am has on your body really scares me. I've tried everything, sleeping pills, reducing lights/electronics hours before sleep, light exercise/stretches, meditation but there's nothing at all that's making me sleepy. It's like my body has forgotten how to sleep. I don't even know what I'm trying to say or ask here. Maybe is there anyone with similar problems or tips?
Signal	It’s like a hiccups but instead of being a hiccups, you snore or breathe once and it wakes you up. It happens to me often at night and prevents me from getting a good night’s sleep. I have been trying trazodone 50mg for sleep for 2 nights but it hasn’t really worked for me entirely. I guess I was able to get some sleep but when I see my eyes in the morning they’re so red that it seems that I didn’t get any sleep at all. My mom tells me she’s seen me snore and sleep when she comes to my room but I have no way to know if I was really sleeping then or trying to fall asleep.
NotSignal	Insomnia.The seconds feel like minutes,The minutes feel like hours,The hours feel like days,Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...It's exhausting,Such a simple form of torture
NotSignal	Good evening/morning! It’s nearly 5:30am and I’ve been wide awake all night. I was diagnosed as asthmatic quite recently and I’m on quite high doses of steroids and inhalers. I’ve always struggled to sleep as long as I can remember but I feel like I haven’t had a ‘proper’ night’s sleep since mid-December. This is probably due to a combination of my asthma symptoms, my medication, my husband’s snoring (although I wear earplugs every night) and just the fact that I’ve been signed off work for almost a month since exacerbation of asthma hospitalised me at the end of December and overall my sleep routine is absolutely buggered. Anyway, just thought I’d say hi! 😴
Signal	I give up. For the past couple of weeks I've been experiencing BAD insomnia. Not all nights are bad but most are and it is incredibly frustrating. I used to be an ambitious person. Ever since I turned 16, I was struggling on and off with this insomnia shit. Now I'm 20 and it only seems to be getting worse. I don't understand why my mind is so alert at night, it doesn't seem to calm down. On top of that, I find it difficult to function during the day. I'm curious...what should I do? Obviously, I should put the phone down and turn it off but I am making this post because I tried everything I could to make my sleep better. Insomnia is a curse I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.
Signal	Fuck diphenhydramine (Benadryl, unisom) and the fucked up dreams it gives you and/or the restless leg syndrome that ensues RIGHT FUCKING BEFORE YOU THINK YOU’RE AN INCH from sleep......!Just fuck you, you little pink bastards.....
Signal	I’m so tired. I had been mystery sick for the last 6 months with a number of issues that docs never found a reason for. Around the time the illness started, I began waking up right as I started dreaming. The majority of time this would happen, my heart would be beating faster than normal and it would feel like adrenaline was running through me. The dreams were not scary at all, and I only had mild anxiety. I figured it was all the discomfort from my illness. Fast forward to a month ago, my illness clears up, but I now wake up at least 3 - 4 times a night, every night, always right as I start dreaming. There’s a sensation of being peeled out of the dream into consciousness. I’m extremely tired and groggy throughout the day. My sleep routine covers all the basics - no screens, cold room, no loud noises or light, etc, and I go down just fine, but I can’t stay down. I’ve tried cbd oil, teas, lots of different vitamins and supplements. Im on 300mg Gabapentin a day which I’ve tried all at one before bed, and now I’m on 25mg Trazodone and still can’t stay down.I’ve been tested for sleep apnea with on very mild results (3 events per night), but I’ve been trying a CPap and that doesn’t help either.Has anyone else dealt with this? Feels like there is something wrong with my brain, perhaps brought on by the illness, but I’m wondering if maybe this is just what classic insomnia is? I’m going to do a more comprehensive sleep study, and also get a heart monitor for the night but all this has me pretty nervous about what the hell is going on exactly.
NotSignal	I have heard from so many people and doctors that it's so misnamed. The should be fatal brain damage or something. Apparently fatal sporadic insomnia is not insomnia but is a neurological problem.
NotSignal	This might be a weird question but I'm wondering if this happens to anyone else. Whenever I struggle to sleep, there's usually a billion different ways it can go down- sometimes I do the traditional tossing and turning, but other times it feels like I'll shut my eyes, my mind goes blank, and it's suddenly 2 hours later. For all intents and purposes I'd assume that during this period of time I'm probably blacking out, even if it's not for a very long stretch of time.Usually tho I'm realizing that on nights where I feel like I haven't slept at all, during that "blackout phase" there was a point where I began "thinking on autopilot" about something completely random and visualizing it, etc. Basically it seems like I'm dreaming at some point but the memories of the dream are so extremely vague or brief that I can't tell whether I actually dreamt or not. The only reason it's so weird to me is that I typically don't feel rested, and so I look at the clock and think I haven't slept still. It's not until I remember a dream I had that I realize I must have slept at some point during the night while blacking out but I just don't remember it well enough to think I did.Semi-related but a crazy coincidence- the dream I had tonight was about a laptop specifically built to play DDR for some reason. After waking up around 4 AM and checking Twitter, it turns out Konami is now releasing a PC version of Dance Dance Revolution. Go figure.
Signal	I can't sleep because my anxiety will grow stronger when the clock hits at 3am or 4am then i started crying and hoping that i could get sleep at that time
Signal	I haven't slept proper in months.I have a long list of things I need to do but I am living in a zombie state of mind right now and cannot complete these things. I have no health insurance and have no idea how to crawl out of this. I have 13 trazodone pills left and they usually don't even work but I have them for emergent days that I absolutely have to be somewhere or be a human and I just don't know what else to do right now.I tell myself every night "hello brain, me again, we will sleep at 10pm and that is final" and woops. It's 4:50am and we didn't sleep. I have no job, and my car was recently totalled at no fault of my own (it was literally parked outside my house), and this still wasn't an eye opener (or eye closer?) That I need to get my shit together. My marriage ended months ago which is when the not sleeping started and the depression isn't even here at this point because I have no brain function at most points of the day to even think about the sadness. I see no end to this. I told myself before my car was totaled that starting college might restructure my life, as when my marriage ended I quit school as I had lost sight of what I really wanted out of life. Now I am unemployed, entirely broke, no car, no way to even get to school or a job (school is 20 minutes driving and several hours walking and I can't guarantee weather is even safe, and I have applied to all nearby work positions).I'm just lost and scared right now of how much worse this could get. I'm scared I will lose the rest of what I have in my possession.
Signal	I can't sleep every night anymore. In order to fall asleep, I have to be up for 36-40 hours. I have to skip a night of sleep in order to sleep the next.Last night was a "skip" night.Hopefully tonight, and hopefully soon, I'll be getting tired. I don't feel it coming on yet, though.It's due to depression. Complete and utter depression is doing this, and I've never felt it quite like this in my life. I'm not lashing out anymore, though, so that's good. I'm not numb. I wish I was. I'm just dead inside and keeping myself distracted from it. I'm trying to forget or not notice multiple aspects of my own reality right now and pretend that they are just very temporary little bumps in the road...and then I remember the one thing that's not coming back, and I start to delve into a very dark place...I'm not sure why I'm posting here. Actually...that's not true. I'm posting so that a certain person can see it at some point, but that's not right. I don't want them to feel guilty. It's not their fault, mind you. They're going through it too. I guess it's a solidarity thing, but that's not right either. That's codependent.I need to just be...proactive... That's just hard to do without sleep. When I do sleep, however, I'm in a horrible mood for the entire day. It's not until my body lacks that sleep that I start to feel as if my brain becomes logical and less emotionally reactive.It's all a catch 22.Hey, at least I did some productive stuff today as work goes. I fought through the depression to get it done. So I guess you can be proud of me for that... I can be proud in myself, I should say.Yeah, my mind is definitely blocking some of this out.I never would have thought I would have been like this, wanting things that I never wanted before. That's gotta be just instinct, right?Whatever it is, I want to say that I know we made the right choice. There will be another time for it. This current life is very messy, very chaotic, and I just want to fix what is directly around me, and I want to fix myself.I just want to treat my girl better.I want to be able to give her something truly great and not just mediocre.I want to sleep... ...
Signal	I know that my insomnia is induced by anxiety, and it’s been about a month. I can’t stop thoughts going around in my head all day that this is never going to get better and it sent me down a spiral, I’ve honestly thought about ending it because I can’t deal with how tired and stressed it makes me. I’m trying to pull myself out of this hole with therapy, but I can’t escape my thoughts. Does anyone know how to stop this spiral? I don’t want to die because I have so much good stuff in my life but I can’t take it. Has anyone gotten out of this, if so, how? I try doing things I enjoy but can’t stop that little voice in the back of my head. Someone please please help me.
Signal	For this week I haven’t been able to sleep until morning. Even when I relax my body muscles, I feel the tension in my head. I feel frustrated and don’t know what to do. And my immune system is wearing down because of chronic insomnia.
Signal	Has anyone taken Lunesta before? I have been prescribed 3mg of Lunesta but I’ve heard some fucked up stories while people were on it. Something-something “sleep driving.”Thanks for any incentive. I’m terrified of trying it.
Signal	Me: "Hey Doc about my sleeping pills--."Doc: "Your not due for another prescription for 3 months" Me: "no It's not that they don't work they make it worse"Doc: "What do you mean they make it worse?"Me: "Its harder to sleep with the voices of the damned screaming their death throws in your ear."Doc: "Yeah I am switching you"apparently my sleeping pills can cause auditory hallucinations in women. They did not know this when they first put me on it. I started halving the pills and the voices went away.
NotSignal	I'm going to log my daily experiences taking Ambien here in case anyone is interested. Background: 30 year old MaleDiagnoses: ASD-1 (Aspergers/High Functioning Autism), Insomnia
Signal	When I first started quetiapine (Seroquel) for depression back in late 2017, it was like being hit in the head with a hammer. I was soooo drowsy, could hardly keep my eyes open as I was getting ready for bed. Nowadays, even though it still helps a little, it's nothing like it used to be.Two weeks ago I started Wellbutrin (for depression) and my insomnia has become a lot worse. Neither quetiapine, trazodone or mirtazapine seem to help much. Trazodone and mirtazapine have some effect as they make me drowsy, but that drowsiness is mild and doesn't help me fall asleep. Anyway, I wanted to ask those of you who take or have taken trazodone, quetiapine and mirtazapine if they still work like they did when you first started them. My doctor won't prescribe me Z-drugs or benzodiazapines because "they're not long-term solutions", but well, antihistamines don't seem to be long-term solutions either...
NotSignal	These days, i really can't sleep.. i can’t feel sleepy!!I stay awake all night, sometimes I sleep at 5 am but I wake up at 7 amI try to sleep but I can't !!!!It makes me sick pff
NotSignal	Now, I have 2 boxes from my doctor and am wondering if any of you have seen long term improvements in sleep? There have been many studies about how it improves cortical thickness and gaba receptor density in people with rett syndrome and apparently reduces effect of stress hormones in rats. The real test is actual users on reddit however. Have any of you noticed long term improvements, like do you feel it helped to upregulate gaba receptors? Or is it BS? As a long term benzo user who shot their gaba receptors to pieces I'd like to hear your stories.
NotSignal	When I can’t sleep I like to draw. It helps me to get rid of my negative thoughts and it really clears my mind. Do some of you draw when you can’t sleep?
Signal	Since two weeks ago I am experiencing insomnia. Difficulty falling asleep and waking up in the middle of the night with little chance of sleeping again.I finally went to my GP 2 days ago and it was a very fruitful discussion. I now keep a sleep diary and noooo mobile phones at least 1.5 hrs before bedtime. Bought myself some books for reading outside my bedroom before bedtime. He prescribed me with 10pcs of pills (Nytamel) which he said to use only as needed.Anyway so 2 days ago I did not get sleep from the previous night so I drank one pill, tried to sleep a 10pm and woke up at 5.45am (my first deep sleep in a long time yey). So during that day I was optimistic. Thought to myself I dont need pills to achieve deep sleep in that night. So I tried to sleep at 10pm and was very relaxed with no too intrusive thoughts at all. Then I woke up at 1am. I was horrified that I drank another pill and fell asleep after perhaps 30 min but when I woke up I feel shit lol.I keep researching about CBT-I and found one of its measures is Sleep Restriction Therapy whose main goal is to reduce waking up in the middle of the night.So I just wish to ask if it is okay to combine the two methods (i.e. I will never go to my bedroom tonight unless I am sleepy enough to doze off and once it occurs I will drink one pill). I think this way, I will regain my sleep drive while being able to achieve deep sleep.TLDR: I was prescribed with pills for use as necessary. Did not take one on 2nd night and woke up in the middle of the night and ended up taking one. On this 3rd night, good idea to sleep until later and once sleepy enough, to take another pill?
NotSignal	I don’t know if I slept last night, tried this thing where the psychologist said to go to bed and try not to sleep but think of things, well anyway, I remember having clear dreams in my head then I would jerk back out of it as if I hadn’t been asleep, and I thought REM sleep was the last stage of sleep? So I’m confused if I was actually asleep or just imagining images cause I feel like I’ve slept nothing this morning.
Signal	No idea what’s happening to me. I have been trying to sleep for 4 hours. I need to wake up for work in just over two hours. I’m totally screwed. I’m facing an intense 12+ hour shift on no sleep. This has never happened to me before.
NotSignal	The past three days I’ve gotten a fair amount of sleep, even to the point of where I’ll go back to sleep and get up 11-12pm. Prior to this, I really had trouble falling and staying asleep. But the past few days I’ve slept about 8 hours total each day. Without much waking up. Not sure if it’s a trend or an aberration.
NotSignal	beabadooboodeedodboopdeeboo. i feel fine tho.but the second the clock strikes past 3 i am done for the night, there’s no going to sleep easy (not that there ever was).
Signal	I can fall asleep but not stay asleep. I'm nearly 32 and it's been this way as long as I can remember. From 16-30 I mainly relied on benzos, specifically Xanax in the end, to get through the night and not be constantly exhausted. Unfortunately, when i wanted to start trying to get pregnant, I realized I had become physically dependent on them. Coming off was rough and those withdrawal symptoms were so scary, as was the the thought that I could become so addicted to something without abusing it or knowing it. My baby is now 10 months old and the insomnia is worse than ever. He sleeps 11-12 hours a night, but I can't sleep more than 3-4 hours scattered throughout the night. I have a Skype appointment with my psychiatrist on Monday, but I don't even know what to think about going on. My dad gave me some short acting Ambien and they don't help at all. OTC sleep aids (both types) are what get me through the night now, but barely. I really don't want to go back on benzos after all that, but am considering it as I do have severe anxiety as well. Melatonin gives me insane nightmares so I don't take that. Frankly, I don't want to take anything but it seems to be the only option for me. No matter what I eat and drink or how much I exercise, I just can't stay asleep. Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone truly conquered this? I need hope
Signal	I’ve been a pretty good sleeper when I was younger but it got really bad in college when I got a roommate. I’m a pretty anxious person so I can convince myself that something is/should be keeping me awake and then I stay awake. (For roommates it was that they’d walk in the room and wake me up and then I’d stay up until they walked in). So since about June of last year (7-ish months now) I’ve been struggling with sleeping whether it’s falling asleep or staying asleep or both. It started with me straight up pulling an all nighter out of nowhere and then getting 5 hours of sleep (unusual for me back then) the next day and having to call in sick for work and it just kind of stuck. I know it’s anxiety related because I would just keep getting less sleep, and then the weekend would come and I would get more sleep no problem.The issue with my sleep is that I will be so exhausted, find myself falling asleep, basically jolting myself awake and thinking “wow I actually fell asleep!” And then staying awake for hours waiting for sleep again. And while I’m trying to sleep I will be hyper focused on getting back to sleep and tossing and turning. Then I’ll check the time and 3 or 4 hours have passed. And during this time I’m not exactly conscious but I’m not sleeping for sure. You could tap on me and be alert right away. It’s ridiculous!This has really affected me and how I see my job. I love my job but with little sleep it feels more and more draining to get to work and function at a normal level. I find myself dreading work every night I have to go the next day. Sundays are the worst.How do I stop myself from doing this? I want to just sleep and not worry about sleep:(Oh and as for things I’ve tried:MagnesiumValerian rootEssential oils
NotSignal	I have to appreciate the absolute chaos of the whole thing. Going to take work off today. Not been able to function at all this week so there is no point and is just a source of anxiety. Actually don’t feel as bad as the previous days but it’s just too difficult to function right now.I find I can’t really multi task. Taking the day off will help me get my doctor appointments sorted as I’ve not been able to call back a therapist over a referral due to lack of time/focus. If I could not sleep and function I would take feeling like shit but I really struggle working through emails/writing with this. I can make decisions we’ll enough but it’s the work that I struggle with.Wanted to quit and take a break for a bit but not sure what I would do after and that scares me.
Signal	Couldn't sleep last night, again. Despite the fact that I went out with a very good friend of mine and got some sunshine. No REM last night and I am afraid to take responsibility for a lot of things. Used to be a hard-worker, sharp-mind, and an intense passion for art. I used to be really attractive too. Unfortunately, BDD is a thing and we live in a looks-based society that is super judgmental. My skin looks so horrid and men cannot look me in the eye lol. No REM due to internet addiction and BPD/OCD/BDD...intrusive thoughts are so annoying. Nobody asks to suffer with mental illness. Nobody asks to suffer with depression. I don't eat much and it's hard for me to listen to others. In one ear and out the other. My mom is very concerned. I fear I cannot work or go to school because of this. My mother is 64 and I feel bad. I have no motivation to help her around the house and I know I should. I just feel too depressed to do anything. There's a part of me that wants to end my life. Losing a lot of weight. Family stress s annoying.
NotSignal	How does Doxepin compare to mirtazapine for treating insomnia? Mirt has been helpful, but I'm curious how the two compare.
NotSignal	Can someone tell me a free useful site or an app that helps with mental health,calm and sleep please?
Signal	lol. i am suffering hella right now. i was able to somehow manage sleep yesterday night and now i’m back to still being awake at 5:10 am and i realize now that i have been living life like this even before school shut down i always used to stay up which in return caused me to skip school. i’m glad now there is no school to go to so i don’t have to suffer off no sleep there but i genuinely do not understand why i sleep at day time, maybe i should try sleeping with all my fucking lights on or something but i’m getting tired of my tiredness lmfao i’m sick of thinking i fixed my shit and bam back to square 1 i take melatonin and it doesn’t work and no one knows how much this is genuinely making me go insane it’s causing me to think irrationally and i am one who meditates i’m one who deeply loves life but holy fucking shit I JUST WANT A STABLE SLEEP SCHEDULE GOD FUCKING DAMN IT
NotSignal	A month ago I did an all nighter to try fix my sleep schedule, I had issue getting to sleep for the first 4 days but gradually it worked.But now the last week or so I’ve been staying up later and later and I’ve been finding it hard to get to sleep and calm my mind down but I’ve been managing to do so.However last night I’ve not sure if I’ve slept at all, and I feel really tired. My mind was just racing to keep me awake and I feel like I may have went overtired and it’s the first night in weeks where I’ve not had 7+ hours and have struggled to sleep.I really don’t want insomnia to return especially with the progress I’ve made. Any advice?
Signal	I recently got a Sleep Study Done and my sleep specialist prescribed me Belsomra 10mg.Unfortunately, It didnt help me stay asleep at all in fact it made me stay up and I felt so horrible.Does anyone also have this problem or has tried Belsomra?
Signal	For any fellow chronic sufferers:So I’ve been struggling with pretty severe insomnia for years now. I’ve tried a variety of meds that didn’t really work. I finally figured out a combination of medications that works for me almost every single night, and I wanted to share just in case it could help anyone here because I know how insanely frustrating this condition is. It’s amazing to finally get a good night’s rest!This is the combination I use:**Prescription** (but relatively easy to get for insomnia/anxiety):25 mg Trazodone,20 mg Hydroxyzine **+****OTC**:10 mg melatonin, 165 mg magnesium Hopefully this helps out at least one person!
NotSignal	6 days of that jagged kind of sleep, full of vivid dreams and waking up; full of times where I could swear I was awake the whole time; full of wakefulness. No rest, no rejuvenation, no peace. I am tired.
Signal	For almost two years I've struggled with horrible insomnia. I'd get 2-4 hours of sleep for several nights in a row, then have a night I couldn't sleep at all. I rarely got more than 6 hours of sleep. I couldn't function at all. Now, I'm to the point where I usually get 7 hours of sleep, but have a few nights a month where I get more like 4-5 hours of sleep. I'm getting better and better and understanding the causes those bad nights now, and I am having more success at avoiding them. I know that all of us have different triggers, but I write this in the hopes that it resonates with someone out there and helps you figure out how to manage your own sleep. My insomnia was caused by the following:*Stress*Anxiety*A mind that wouldn't shut off*Sleep anxiety that developed after the above three had manifested long enough to cause me problems*Staying up too late in an attempt to “treat” my insomniaHere's what helped:*Keeping a sleep log. I figured out what my triggers were, and what helped me sleep well vs poorly. I had tried to cure my insomnia the normal way for 6 months, but after 2 weeks of keeping a log, I realized my insomnia wasn't responding to the treatment and I needed to forge another path.*Quitting work – I am (or was) self employed, managing a small company with part time employees, and also a full time mom with a new baby. Trying to do both at once was causing my stress and anxiety to go sky high. So, I took a break from work. Now that things are under better control, I'm slowly going back, but very part time, with more structured hours and childcare, and no deadlines for projects. If it is still too stressful, I'll have to back off again. *Avoiding caffeine after 2 PM* No melatonin. It just gave me headaches, and didn't help at all.*Sleeping with a heavy blanket, and a pillow to cuddle against.*Avoiding anything that makes me think within an hour of bedtime. Oddly enough, screens are fine. Avoiding screens was giving me too much mental space to become anxious about sleep, and was thus a bad move. A boring TV show or stupid phone game helps me get ready for sleep. An exciting or intriguing book will keep me up. I had to unfollow all FB friends who post about politics. I downloaded apps to make my screens put out less blue light near bedtime. * Go to bed early when I'm sleep deprived. When I'm caught up on sleep, I typically go to bed around 11. When I'm sleep deprived, this is too late, and my body has begun to produce stress hormones to keep me awake by then. The more sleep deprived I am, the earlier my bedtime should be. I'll explain this more later.* Nap if I had a really bad night. It reduces my sleep anxiety, and makes me produce less cortisol before bed. This is not recommended for normal insomniacs.* Don't go to bed if I'm excited or upset about something, as it won't work. I'll just lay in bed thinking. Take whatever time I need to wind down, preferably with a boring show, even if this means going to bed late. The typical insomnia advice is to go to bed very late in order to make you exhausted. You're supposed to get so tired you'll just fall asleep the moment your head hits the pillow. This wasn't my problem. My problem was that my body was in a stress cycle where the less I slept the harder it was to sleep. I'd sleep less and less until I couldn't sleep at all. For a while, the only thing that would break these cycles was getting sick, and sleeping all day because of my illness. Staying up late to try to treat my insomnia exacerbated it, as the later I stayed up, the more stress hormones my body produced to keep me up. If I don't sleep well, I have to go to bed early, before my body starts trying to keep me awake. Another thing I've noticed is that if I go to bed too late for my tiredness level, I wake up early. I get shorted on both sides! It really is important to go to bed at the right time!Sleep anxiety was and is a complicating factor in my insomnia, but it wasn't the primary factor. Taking a nap helps reduce the anxiety, so if I'm feeling anxious about sleep, I nap. Going to bed early after bad days also reduces my anxiety. It feels like I have multiple chances to try to fall asleep, instead of being screwed if I fail on the first try. This isn't standard insomnia advice. I only recommend it if you, like me, also have a-typical insomnia.Last night, I slept 5 hours. Honestly, I'm proud of myself. I feel like I did really well. I was kept up until about 1 by my family, but I fell asleep quickly after getting to bed. Since I got to sleep too late, I woke too early: 6:00 AM. I know that to make up for this, I should go to bed an hour early tonight, and that should fix things and stop the sleeplessness from spiraling out of control. For what it's worth, I've been working on my insomnia with the stuff I outlined here for nine months now. It's taken a lot of experimentation to figure out what my triggers are and what helps me relax and become sleepy. For the first three months, things were still really awful. My sleep anxiety was a huge part of my problem, and I didn't fully know what would help me. I still had a lot of nights I didn't sleep at all. This only got better gradually. I feel like things have been really good for the past two moths. It's become more and more common for me to fall asleep within a half hour. If I have a bad night, I can usually identify what caused it, which helps me feel like I have control. The anxiety comes back sometimes, especially if I struggle several nights in a row. However, it's become easier and easier to defeat. I hope this helped somebody!
Signal	So I've always been a night owl. Insomnia has been a struggle for me especially this year. I stay up and watch movies, rush to do my homework, then fall asleep at 2am and wake up at 6am for school. Then take a nap in the afternoon maybe and the cycle continues. I'm tired throughout the day, my depression and anxiety worsen, and overall I feel like shit.Ever since quarantine started it just got way worse. I stay up till up to 6-10am before going to sleep and waking up at 3-4pm. I've tried to lay in my bed "early" (4am) but I stay awake for hours. My body physically just can't fall asleep. My sleep schedule is tremendously impacting all aspects of my life. Staying up all night causes me to binge eat. I've gained 15 pounds which is the worse since I have disordered eating and that stresses me out a lot. I also can't sleep because of my anxiety about personal stuff. I used to masturbate to help me get drowsy but now it lost all effect. I'm still wide awake even after I finish. Nothings helping and my mom doesn't take this seriously even though I've talked with her when I thought it was at its worse earlier this year or maybe even last year (clearly I was gravely mistaken). I can't live like this anymore. It's been months and my depression is eating me up. If I don't fix myself up now I'm honestly gonna give up.For the record I'm a 14 y/o female. I swear I'm not being angsty or anything. I was actually diagnosed in late 2018 with depression (although I'm not getting treatment and you can see how that's working out for me). It's an issue that is fucking up my mental and physical health in all seriousness and I feel like nobody is listening to me. Please don't give me any bullshit answers cause I've tried it all. I'm desperate.
Signal	silently (very loudly because no ones home) wept to myself as i got washed up in the bathroom because i am just so tired. i’m so tired of not sleeping, and being perpetually tired all the fucking time. i feel like i can’t do anything because of the fatigue and mental strain. you ever heard that quote? something along the lines of “i must scream but i have no mouth.”? **its like that**. i have no capacity to sleep and no matter how many times I scream. no ones listening to me. not the doctors i see, no one either believes it’s as severe as i’m saying. i was even told once it’s okay to only sleep 3 hours a night because “not everyone sleeps well”. that’s a first for me. i’m not someone who cries. this is probably the first time i’ve cried all year. mostly because i come from an abusive family and have no capacity to shed any more tears for anyone including myself. *anywho*. I have to go to work soon and i know it’s about to be a longggggg day, and i’m a pre school teacher so no distance learning for me! i’ll be front and center, bright and early , with my mask on my face, tears in my eyes, and a red bull in my left hand.
NotSignal	I have an 8 hour shift tomorrow, it’s going to be so great with no sleep lmao, im so excited Im going to book an online doc appointment to get sleeping meds tomorrow
NotSignal	Experiencing every day agitated and exhausted and then dreading the night where your mind drives you absolutely crazy and knowing its only you, your brain that is causing all of the issues. When i try to explain to people who have one sleepless night a year how intensely this affects your mental health they think I’m being dramatic. What do you guys think?
NotSignal	If you are struggling with either.. find a way to see a natural doctor such as a chiropractor! I struggled for over 10 years with debilitation anxiety (on/off) and years of insomnia. My doctor was able to find the route cause with bloodwork for vitamin levels and a saliva test for hormone levels. This was after begging multiple main stream doctors for help and them just prescribing sleeping medications and anti anxiety meds. If your insurance can cover it or you can afford it, it’s definitely worth a shot! My problem ended up being a severe low level of cortisol. She guessed it would have started to affect my heart in the near future. Even on the days I didn’t have panic attacks, I would wake up with my heart pounding every single morning. She put me on a supplement for the cortisol and started acupuncture and within a few months I was sleeping so much better.Another suggestion. If you can not get to a doctor, how much time do you spend in the sun? I moved and stopped being able to see that doctor and quickly declined in my sleep. When I started spending hours a day in the sun.. I started sleeping well again! I’m assuming it’s because natural sunlight also regulated cortisol.Hope this helps someone!
NotSignal	Ok so im actually a lightweight when it comes to alcohol bc i dont drink much. I went practically 9 months wo it btwn 2019-2020 due to legal issues not involving alcohol but i digress......So i got home late from shopping w mom Sunday so i turned on the NASCAR race i had recorded while i was out and cracked open a bottle. Admittedly idk what % it was but stay w me. So that night i didnt really sleep well. I was up a few hrs in middle of night. Finally fell into deep sleep somewhere around 4:30 or 5 when my alarm woke me at 7. Now mind u im almost always up before my alarm. I was so groggy when i woke, which isnt normal for me. Definitely felt like hangover minus the headache. My shift was a 9-5 and i had to take a Red Bull in w me to wake up, which is not unheard of for me. Usually all i need is a few sips but i ended having to consume the whole thing. It definitely got me thru my shift and then some....Well here it is coming up on 1am now the next night and im😳from that Red Bull in the morning. Thankfully im off this next day but there have been times i wasnt and i repeat process all over again.TL;DR: Never consume alcohol evening before a full day of work, u end up chasing sleep for days from combo of caffeine and sleep enhancers.
Signal	I've been struggling to fall asleep since ever and while I'm finally off all sorts of sleep aids (Ambien, Mirtazapine, Doxylamine, Diphenhydramine etc.) I still try to help with herbal supplements and melatonin.But I don't feel anything at all. Like, zero. Absolutetly nothing. Yesterday I tried 10 mg of melatonin and drank a tea with passiflora and some herbal shit that I've let steep for 20 minutes and I couldn't feel the slightest effect.Is this just me or do you know this?
NotSignal	Melatonin has been found to cancel out birth control and lead to you getting pregnant! Please be careful out there!
Signal	I feel awful when I wake up. I miss most of the day. Those nights when I’m up it’s so bad. I can’t fall asleep. How do I fix this?
NotSignal	i am still awake at almost 6:00 am. we have no sleeping aids in my house i am dying
Signal	I'm only a teen, I don't even know why this is happening.During the day I'm so tired, then it's night time, I try sleeping. Ok! Almost falling asleep! Then I feel a horrible feeling, it's like a really strong anxiety that sends chills through my spine.I haven't had more than 3-4 hours in the last three days.I'm so anxious about it I can't breath, it's currently 5:35 AM where I live, haven't slept even a single minute.I'm afraid that I have fatal insomnia, I don't want to die. Not like that.I don't even remember the last time I dreamt with something. I just remember it being a horrible nightmare.Help
Signal	I mean it's fucking 3 am here and I should wake in an hour, and I'm only slightly sleepy Fuck this
NotSignal	hello all. I (F21) struggle hard with anxiety and have found it extremely difficult to get a solid sleep that lasts over 4 hours for the past 7 months. I’ve tried lots of things, sleeping pills and all but not much is working. It doesn’t help that I’m a pessimist towards everything. besides sleeping pills/ prescribed medication, WHAT CAN I DO?E.g. warm showers before bed, aromatherapy, eating or drinking something specific before bed .... anything!!!
Signal	How to get meds?How to get meds?I am a female 41 with 2 kids 220lbs. I do not smoke, I do not drink alcohol of any kind, I do not do any recreational drug use. I am taking blood pressure medication, anxiety and panic disorder medication, and insomnia medication because my blood pressure is high my anxiety and panic are high and I cannot sleep. I have spoken to my pharmacy, I have spoken to my psychiatrist, I have spoken to my pharmacy insurance company, and finally I have spoken to my health insurance company.Flat out, I am terrified that I will run out of medication. Pharmacy will not fill or overfill medications and doctors seem to be clueless as to what to do in that situation.What do I do to keep my medication the same?Experts are recommending that people have at least a 30 to 90 day supply of their regular prescriptions on hand. However, some health programs limit the quantity of prescription drugs a person may obtain at one time, or the number of times they may refill a prescription. Insurance companies, state Medicaid programs, and other payors need to relax these rules now to ensure that people are able to have the drugs they need. The sections below describe the rules that currently limit quantities and refills for prescription drugs, as well as strategies to help people obtain additional quantities of medications or refill a prescription in the wake of the COVID-19 emergency.
NotSignal	Guess I don’t need meds!!!!!! Jk this shit sucks. Literally trying to “fix” your sleeping schedule without the sleeping meds you’ve taken for years is impossible. Some days I stay up 24 hours so I can go to sleep at a decent time. What happens instead?? WAKEUP AT 6am BEST TIME TO BE AWAKE I SWEAR. You totally won’t be tired of being awake in a few hours for work :D! I totally *swear*!
NotSignal	So what is mindfulness exactly? Also, has anyone tried that US military trick to fall asleep quickly and can describe how to relax your face muscles properly? I've tried so many times and can't seem to do it right.
Signal	stayed up all night. fume with anger, cried. just regular night for me. I can't even control one simple thing, sleeping on time. I will always suffer, it's better to end it now
NotSignal	there was this one week during the school year where i’d try to stay up reading at night but i physically couldn’t keep my eyes open and i’d fall asleep. it was honestly the best sleep i’ve ever had since i never had to try or even think about falling asleep. i miss it so much.
NotSignal	Almost every night I wake up after 3 hours of sleep, sometimes 2 sometimes 4. After waking up for the first time it's really hard to go back to sleep and if I can 30 min later I'll be up again.
Signal	I’ve tried both. Mirtazipine seems to work better from what I remember,but I am not positive. I have both and I know in a lot of antidepressants it takes weeks to build up, so which should I start on? Im looking for staying asleep because I always wake up mid night with anxiety. Also if one is better for depression let me know tooI also have a small script for ativan that always works but only use occasionally.
NotSignal	It’s my second day within this week of 24 hours no sleep. I feel alive, not tired but also like hyper as all heck. I hate it. I feel like bouncing off the walls and the longer I’m awake the more awake and like this I feel. Let’s hope these 24 hours don’t go into 48. I’m still like completely sound of mind though and that’s the weird thing, it’s just my body that is hyper, not my mind. I feel completely normal mentally.I still need sleep tho.
Signal	I know this sounds stupid, I know it’s incredibly rare and that there’s only like 30 diagnosed cases in the world. Starting a month ago I started experiencing a near complete lack of ability to sleep I’m talking literally nothing occasionally I’ll fall asleep for about an hour or two. After a week of not sleeping my doctor started me on a course of Zopiclone but only taking it 2-3 times a week, that worked to an extent but still I was staying awake for 2-3 days at a time and then a zopiclone would help me sleep for 6 hours but I’d still feel tired. A week ago I started getting random twitching all throughout my body and went back to my doctor who re filled my sleeping pills but also put me on melatonin but it’s made no difference, even though I’m getting no sleep I’m getting no daytime sleepiness, I don’t nap, I never feel “sleepy” it’s just a constant feeling of exhaustion. During this time I’ve also been seeing a therapist about my sleep and practicing mindfulness, I’m also extremely active and physically fit. I don’t know what to do and at this point can anybody give me any advice or anything to stop me freaking out?
NotSignal	Is it better to not sleep and go through the next day or still try to sleep for 2hours ?
Signal	(I want to apologize in advance for my English) I really need your help guys, I suffer from insomnia for a long time and nothing helps. I have several psychiatrists behind me. I try to get up all the time at the same time as going to bed, I've tried all herbal teas, some antidepressants, but I want to solve the cause and not just the symptoms. I'm 19 years old and I feel really miserable, and I know for myself that if I don't figure it out, it will keep getting worse and worse, I'm losing my mind, I can't even get out of bed and do anything normal. I have to go to work but I can't even get one, My mother wants to kick me out of the apartment and the rest of the family won't help me in any way, I could go on like this indefinitely, if you feel similar and you're in a similar life situation, I'd like to appreciate some personal experience from your. PLEASE*📷*
Signal	Hi. So recently I went through something really traumatic and my anxiety has been all time high. It's been like 3 months now and I still can't get a goodnight's sleep. I have only been sleeping for like 2-3 hours. Sometimes 6. But I am so tired of this routine. How do you improve insomnia caused by anxiety? I am over that event now, and my anxiety is gone, but I still can't sleep.
NotSignal	Hey guys, did anyone try fapping when you wake up at night and can’t fall asleep? Does it help? Or does it increase your alertness even more?
Signal	I know it might not work for everyone else, but it really worked for me last night, at least. I've only tried it a few times, but I went with a half dose instead of a full one because I'm also taking other meds to help me sleep (that don't really work). Before last night, I'd been running on 5 hours of sleep over the last three days. So I tried this stuff and it really worked.It tastes like... What you'd imagine a witches potion to taste like, I guess. Foul, disgusting and you instantly regret ever putting it into your mouth let alone opening it up and smelling it. It's *awful* and I nearly spit it out. But I went to sleep at 10:30 pm last night, and didn't wake up until 9 this morning! It might taste like regret, but I don't regret trying it.I don't know if I'll take this every night, though. And next time I might by the capsules instead of the regret potion. Anyway, I just wanted to share in case anyone was thinking about getting it. It worked great for me, and hopefully, it might help a few of you here to get some sleep when you really need it.
Signal	I started experiencing insomnia a couple months ago, but blamed it mostly on my anxiety because of the pandemic. However I realized during this time I was also having a lot of body issues and was eating way less than I normally did. I cut out a lot of carbs and fatty foods, and lost about 8 pounds (was also exercising intensely every day for about an hour). I wasn’t able to sleep at all, until I was prescribed Lunesta and that was the only thing that would be able to allow me to sleep. Even on Lunesta, I would still occasionally wake up throughout the night. I stuck with the diet because I was seeing good results even though I wasn’t able to get enough sleep. This weekend I ate like trash and was just like “fuck it” because I was so stressed and tired of it all. I ate a lot of carbs and grease, and literally knocked out from a food coma after... I’m having issues trying to stay awake. I didn’t work out so I didn’t drink as much water as I usually do, and was super dehydrated (which I know makes you tired). I remember when I was suffering from depression in high school I would just eat my sadness away and sleep all day lol. Do you think part of the reason I’m experiencing insomnia is because of food? I don’t feel hungry, but I guess my body needs more energy?
NotSignal	I mean like i close my eyes and i see myself jumping off a bridge or running face first into a spiked wall.Now i dont get these thoughts when i am active and awake but as soon as i close my eyes to fall asleep they just flood in.Was just wondering if any1 else has this problem or not,or had any advice(as weed is the only thing i can fall asleep straight away with an empty head but i know its just a short term fix and itll probably just get worse if i rely on it)
NotSignal	In the previous week I remember passing out early for 4 hours then again in the morning for 3.5 hours.This week I can maybe pass out for 2.5 hours 4 after a sleepless night I just want 4 hours
Signal	i’ve never been afraid of anything except insomnia, getting no sleep or just little sleep like 1-2 hrs make you afraid as fuck does anyone else relate?
Signal	Looking for advice and also would love to know if anyone has had a similar experience. So, I work 12am-8am five times per week in a medical manufacturing setting. I have been at this job since Feb 2017. I love my job and the money is great. I was also made permanent recently. Unfortunately, I live on an island where it rains at least 75% of the year.The problems with sleep started with the lockdown in March. I used to sleep 9am-4pm with Tylenol PM and 100mg 5-htp. Since March, I have been getting progressively less sleep and it's gotten down to 2-3 hours per day.I have blackout blinds with blackout curtains, the house is quiet and I excercise. I don't drink any caffeine after 11pm and fast from 6pm-6pm daily.I've tried a bunch of shit to normalise the sleep. The insomnia is ruining my health and my relationships with everyone including myself.Do you think if I were to get a new job during the day, things would improve? Has anyone made this move and if so, what were your results. I'm just starting to wonder if a change would help? Apologies for the long post but nobody around me understands the dilemma.
NotSignal	It got worse now because i started to research psychiatry again and turns out that quackery is far worse than i though. I guess i have too much empathy for this, i might have to stop researching these difficult topics and tell myself "it's fine" when it clearly isn't.
NotSignal	Hi friends struggling with sleep, I recently tried doing this yoga pose "Legs up the wall" and i realized that it had helped with my sleep quality. I do it before bed every night for about 5 minutes at first and now 10 minutes or more. It has been about one month since I started and I do not need to heavily rely on my medications to sleep. Sometimes I don't even need to take them. Anyone can do it, there's a Harvard study to support it as well. Hope it helps
NotSignal	Im writing this as soon as ive woken up from an apparent 6 hour sleep according to samsung health.For mostly the whole year ive slept from 4am till 12pm no issue. Sometimes 6 or 7am to 4pm also. Never waking up in between sleeps.Now recently... as in just a few days ago ive started sleeping at around midnight and waking up around 6ish... so 6 hours of sleep.Is this normal after a substantial sleep schedule change? I feel pretty fucked up if you ask me. I mean im not tired when i wake up but after a while i do get sleepy again. I dont want to feel alone...
NotSignal	I’ve never identified as an anxious person, but the last couple of weeks have brought a new level of angst in my life. I try to battle it with constant distraction, but also look at my phone and laptop screens a lot - wether it’s watching tv or looking up recipes to relax or reading the news to be informed but also freak myself out.So my sleep is.. suffering to say the least.
Signal	(I'm hoping this is the right subreddit for this, if not, can someone direct me to the right place?) So, to get things out of the way, this has been happening for 2-3 months now on and off, I'm 14(F). I've tried melatonin, a diffuser, Zzz Quil, healthy night routines, unhealthy night routines, and I was going to try to get up at an alarm, but it was unnecessary. Basically, what's happening is that, sometimes I'll sleep, but wake up at around 6 AM, and sometimes I'll sleep for an hour, wake up, and sleep for another hour and so on. Also, I know waking up at six isn't just a habit 'cause of school or anything, because I'm homeschooled. And when you're homeschooled, there is no set time you gotta wake up. I've told my therapist about this whole ordeal, and my mom's called the doctor and they basically just said the same thing (relax, have a good sleep routine yada yada). I'm desperate for normal, long lasting sleep at this point. I'm willing to take a mallet to the head to knock me out cold. - Anyways, I can provide more detail if needed, or if this is the wrong subreddit I can move this post to a better one. Melatonin is out of the question, if one more person tells me that melatonin will cure all of my problems I'm going to feel slightly angry.Note: sorry if this is all over the place, I'm still not very good at this whole 'getting things off my chest' thing.TL;DR: Sleeping is hard :( Don't even utter the word melatonin.
NotSignal	Here I am, wide awake in the middle of the night, need to be awake in >5 hours. Meanwhile, my husband is fast asleep and doesn’t even need to be out of bed til 9 am.His day tomorrow will be about 4 hours long. Mine will be 13. Yet he gets to enjoy a full 9-10 of sleep while I lie here plagued with this awful insomnia.It isn’t fair.I know it’s not his fault. I wish I didn’t feel jealous of him. It just feels so unfair.
Signal	Has anyone ever had issues falling asleep due to stomach indigestion? I feel my anxiety and IBS take turns keeping me up...haha funny but sad too.😪
NotSignal	seems like its every other night I cant sleep and I'm so fucking tired of it. I was on meds for sleep, but I moved states in October and the new doctor is refusing to give me my sleeping meds without therapy due to my history of mental illness. the fucking therapist office doesnt answer their phone. I've been calling for 3 weeks now, and everytime I get put on hold for 40+ minutes, no answer, or the line drops. it's like they are TRYING to drive me mad. I just want to fucking sleep. it doesnt help my chronic pain seems to be getting worse and they wont give me my pain meds, either, for the same reason. I dont have a history of abusing perscriptions, so the fact they wont give me it pisses me off. I'd get it if I overdosed in the past, or something, but I have ZERO history of that shit. I'm just a desperate fuck wanting some sleep and pain relief.
NotSignal	Idk what’s wrong with me but for four nights now, I’ve went to bed for like 1-2 hours and wake up. Then can’t fall back asleep until 4-5 in the morning. I’m scared honestly.
Signal	I take Zopiclone usually during a hospital admission (I have other diagnoses) which is only usually a few weeks. Is anyone on it on a more long-term basis? I was told it just usually stops working as you build tolerance to it. Need to make changes to my meds and as it is effective when I do take it looking at it as an option but currently at a loss for a long-term sleep aid medication. Due to my other diagnoses I am extremely limited to what meds I can take. Thank you.
NotSignal	Besides Amazon—as they’re notorious for repackaging and sending out customer returns to other customers... Where can I buy a quality buckwheat pillow?
Signal	So it all began 5 months ago. I’ve been suffering with insomnia. It started out normal then gradually became worse . I remember nov- December as the most horrible months. I would go on 2 days without sleep and get 4 hours the day after but then I sleep again and then the cycle repeats. But I didn’t have the problem of not falling asleep until this month. It’s back. I couldn’t sleep more than an hour today. I get headaches and I often get scared about imagining another day without sleep. This makes me not sleep even more. I take 3mg melatonin . It helped so much but I still wake up after 3-4 hours and then stay up for about 2 hours and then sleep for 5-6 hours. This is considered the best sleep I could get a day but often times I sleep for 1-2 hours and I can’t continue because I panic. I’m scared of everything that’s going on from my headaches to my facial numbness. Pain on the neck and back. Everything hurts. My blood pressure is low. I feel like I’m dying slowly. I have faith but it’s slowly making me more nervous about the next day of not sleeping and having to go another day without sleep. Should I be worried of anything. I need someone to talk to. I feel so worried. Can someone tell me it’s okay?
Signal	My sleeping meds aren’t working, i talked to my psychiatrist and he basically told me to just get off them and then we’ll go from there. I’ve been up for 19 hours already, i’m waiting till i inevitably crash and sleep for 15 hours and then to just do it again, The worse part is i have summer school coming up, you might think that’ll wear me out but nah, i’ve skated 5 miles and i still haven’t been tired in the least bit, my mom struggles a little to and has leftover meds,i took temazepam 30mg, and it helped less than benadryl. Also i can’t just try another medication cause i’m only 16, my psychiatrist can only prescribe me so much, i really am stumped on what to do.
Signal	Has anyone taken seroquel at night and woken up in the morning in an instant uncontrollable rage? I took it last night and the moment I became conscious I smashed my bedroom window. I have no reason for why, nothing to be mad about the seroquel is the only change.
Signal	I’ve taken nyhtol, I’m genuinely tired and I’ve spent the past 3 hours trying to sleep but it. Just. Isn’t. Happening. I know that if I do finally fall asleep I’ll wake up late so I’m kinda fucked either way lmfao
Signal	Has anyone tapered off sleep medication directly before/during/after CBTi? Recently started doing Sleep Restriction as part of CBTi this past week. Going at in on my own using the book Say Goodnight to Insomnia as my main guide. I have been sleeping fairly solidly through my 6 hour sleep window (1200 - 0600) for the past 5 days. Began taking seroquel 200mg for sleep in July (didn't really help) and now in the middle of tapering down. Last night was the first night at 100mg. I woke up 20 minutes early because I was having a bad dream, first dream I've had in a few weeks. I'll stay at this dose and see if my sleep stays even for a little while before cutting down to 50 mg, at which point I may jump off, or try for 25mg. It's hard to cut the tablets that small.
NotSignal	I've been suffering from literally all types of insomnia, I have Bipolar (being treated successfully with Lamotrigine and Therapy) which is comorbid with it, as well as hyperarousal stemming from PTSD. I can't remember the last night I had to do an all nighter, I have only had one instance of poor sleep inertia in the past month, I've stopped self medicating with cannabis, my mood swings are under control. Whilst I wouldn't say I have normal sleep quality, i often will only get 5 to 6 hours, its been a significant improvement and not spending days in a delirious haze has greatly improved my mindset. My boyfriend and family can all see the improvement. I don't really know if anyone will see this but, I'm just so happy. Good night guys! <3
NotSignal	Let's see how and if this works, going to sleep is so bad that I don't even know if this will work on me...
NotSignal	Just spent the last two hours laying comfortably in the dark. Bored out of my mind. Why do I have to be this way? This is bullstuff. You know, insomnia wouldn't be so bad if I felt like doing something during that time. It's like I'm just tired enough to not want to do anything, but too awake to sleep. I'm stuck in sleep limbo. I feel like I'm wasting time not being productive, but I don't want to get too far from the bed either just in case sleep hits. Ahh well, guess I'm gonna go read a book for a while and hope that knocks me out. Maybe a user manual for something, that should be boring enough. If anyone else is awake and wishing for sleep, I hope you find it soon.
Signal	Fairly consistently for over a year I’ve been having incredibly strange cycles of sleep. Some nights I don’t sleep at all. Some nights I sleep for up to 12 hours causing me to miss class or work or whatever is going on the next day. Usually when I don’t sleep it actually ends up being a conscious decision for fear of sleeping through the next day. I’m never actually tired by bedtime until early morning when it’d be ridiculous for me to think I’d be able to wake up if I did.It’s super draining and has gotten worse over the last few days. I have depression and anxiety and I’m sure that’s the cause but I mentioned to my doctor and they said there’s not much to do but try to get on a schedule.So any advice for getting on a regular sleep schedule??
NotSignal	I’m just trying to rule out some things. My folks have a new bed that I sleep on when I visit and I always get 8-9 hrs of sleep, but when I’m back home on my old worn out bed, I only sleep 5-6 hours. Slept 3 last night.I’ve been waking up at 3am every night for the past week and I just get so restless I can’t go back to sleep.Another problem I have is I can’t sleep past 7am at home. No matter what time I go to sleep, my body can’t sleep past 7am on this bed. Praying it’s that.
NotSignal	I slept at 11pm. I woke up at 3am. Fell asleep again and woke up at 4am. Fell asleep again and woke up at 6am. Then fell asleep again and woke up around 8. I kept waking up but at least I slept lol. I slept for probably 8 hours so I’m happy. Yesterday, I slept for 5 hours, the two days before that probably around 6-7 hours. I want to say it’s getting better. So for those of you, don’t give up! It will get better for you!
NotSignal	I have been having these short hallucinations when I wake up for a while now but I’ve only just realized that they were never real. I never realized because I’ve only ever seen small spiders on the wall or ceiling slowly crawl across and then just disappear into the darkness. I was never concerned because I thought these were real spiders until one night I woke up to a big white one in front of my face and I turned on my phone flashlight quickly to kill it and it was magically gone within seconds without a trace. That’s when I realized that maybe these spiders were never real. That was my only experience with these hallucinations until just last night. I opened my eyes and saw an alien looking drone with lots of little arms hovering above my face. I was terrified and it just hovered there for a moment above me until it just slowly disappeared into the darkness. This made me was to vomit I was so scared. I went back to sleep thinking I just had a bad dream even though I knew I was awake and this same hallucination happened 3 times in a row within like an hour or so. I got so scared to go back to sleep that I just turned on my lamp so that if it happened again I could see more clearly and it didn’t happen again. I need advice or tips on how to avoid them if there are any ways to do such a thing. I can’t watch any kind of horror movie or anything without vomiting I cannot live a horror movie. For the moment I’ve placed 3 night lights around my room hoping to keep my hallucinations at bay. Anything you guys have found helpful would be much appreciated
NotSignal	anyone else feeling a sudden anxiousness tonight? my sleep has been so messed up since quarantine and i dread the day i have to go back to work with a now fucked up sleep schedule
NotSignal	But i hate when people say i slept 6 hours only this night and i think i have insomnia, no you don’t insomnia isn’t on” bad night “ ( 6 hours is a dream for me )! ahhhhh i want to scream
Signal	Has anyone here suffered insomnia caused by over training? I enjoyed working out regularly but I had to put that on a pause last week as my heart rate went way too up from little exercise. Now I'm mentally pretty calm but I feel my heart pounding and my body just doesn't let me sleep during nights. I feel like my resting pulse (+70 beats) is up a little bit because I burned out myself with the over training and other life stresses. It's so frustrating to get palpitations.I've done my sleep hygiene stuff, stopped consuming caffeine, started to meditate. I wonder how could I get rid of this insomnia? Could beta-blockers like propanol help together with some other insomnia medicine? I know my pulse (+70) is within normal range but I still get palpitations.I started taking mirtazapine and I have 2 night behind me. First night I managed to get 4 hours sleep with 3.75 mg dose. I upped the dose to 7.5 mg felt nothing after 2.5 hours, took another 7.5 mg and it didn't help.
NotSignal	Looks like it’s gonna be a sleepless night for me. Any tips to function tomorrow? I don’t drink coffee or energy drinks - only tea. Thanks so much in advance.
NotSignal	I've been lifting for 8 years and I look like shit. I blame this on my chronic insomnia and I'm thinking of just giving up.
Signal	After being awake for nearly 3 days straight, following a week of maybe 4 hours sleep each night, I was feeling really shattered and defeated. Finally last night I fell asleep and got a nice 12 hours, and didn't wakeup once. In retrospect, and with the benefit of feeling rested, I realise that not being able to sleep isn't the enemy; its the stressors that keep us in this cycle that are the problem. For me it's working a 35 hour week, studying at uni full-time, and excessive people pleasing, compounded with the fear of not being able to function while doing these tasks. (When I have nowhere to be the next morning I sleep fine). For the next person it could be shift-work, family stressors, etc. Idk. When I remember the issue isn't the insomnia itself, but the crushing demands of life that are causing and exacerbating it, it becomes a lot easier to put into perspective. Sleep issues are probably a sign that something has to give, and we collectively need to cut ourselves some slack. \*Also when you feel lonely remember that 1 in 3 people you meet will struggle with insomnia at some point, and 1 in 10 are struggling with it currently. That always makes me feel less worried and afraid.
Signal	Im feeling like s*it recently due to my insomnia, my anxiety is really bothering me cause i just want it to work. I feel like im gonna have a panic attack
Signal	I have OCD WITH insomnia so I’ve no clue for me, but I feel like I’m really scared for this vacation this week. Didn’t sleep last night it’s 7 am and am worried I won’t sleep on the vaca. Just wanna hear some other stories to calm me down if I don’t sleep
NotSignal	When you take Gabapentin, how long do you feel the effects for? Like if you take say 300 mg at night, how long do you feel it into the next day? Thanks.
NotSignal	I'm mostly asexual (demisexual) so I haven't taken birth control before. I'm 30 now and have had skin and sleep problems get worse since my mid20s with total insomnia common right before my period.I just started a generic for Yaz to see how this does for hormonal imbalances.How did the rest of you react to various BCs?
Signal	Hi everyone! I don’t necessarily have insomnia but I didn’t know where to post this question and I figured this would be my best bet! I was prescribed trazodone Bc i was having constant anxiety attacks through the night and I couldn’t sleep. Basically I have really bad health anxiety and kept thinking I was going to d*e in my sleep due to an illness and my doctor gave me these meds so I wouldn’t overthink and just pass out. I was also prescribed paroxetine for general anxiety disorder. It’s been about 3 weeks since. I wasn’t consistant with the trazodone because once my anxiety got better I was able to sleep better. I took them again recently and I notice I wake up with a headache that Kinda stays through the day. It’s not super intense but it’s just there. I don’t wanna take pain relief Bc is just too extra on top of what else I take lol. Is this a side effect or is it Bc I didn’t like sleep through all of it? I slept like 9 hours... does it get better if I remain consistent with it and take more often or is this just a side effect that kinda stays? Is the headache caused due to also taking another ssri? If I keep getting headaches ima just not refill my prescription Bc I don’t see the point of paying for it if it makes me feel groggy af during the day. Would like to hear anyone’s experience if any. Also my prescription was 50mg but I cut it in half 🥴Thanks in advanced!
Signal	i have really bad insomnia. really, really bad. can’t find anyone else i know with the same issue. i’ve tried benadryl, i’ve tried promethazine, melatonin, night nurse. useless. i’ve tried valium which helps sometimes but sometimes just gives me freaky sleep paralysis and i have to take 2 or 3 in a night just to get 7 hours or so becahse i keep bloody waking up. valium is currently my best bet but i have no income and it’s costing me a lot for something that’s still fairly unreliable, and i know if i end up unable to get it anymore like i did with xanax i’ll be broken. xanax always worked for me when i used to have it... fairly cheap, a bar would knock me out for 8 hours whenever i fell asleep and i was so relaxed the next day. i love and loved the stuff but my dealer stopped doing it and i can’t find a single person near me who does so i’m just suffering. the point is that i get stupid breakdowns because of insomnia. i can handle one night alone, when everyone else has fallen asleep, it’s 4am and i’m the last man standing, i guess, at some point i almost feel happy, when i decide to get up and do coffee and face the world with minor sleep deprivation induced psychosis. but when i get past the point of one night without i just lose it. it isn’t funny anymore. why can i not just fucking sleep?! people think insomnia is just a thing or taking a couple hours to fall asleep but mine causes me to feel extremely lonely. wishing i could just sleep like everyone else. wondering why i have to have so much guilt and anxiety keeping me up endless nights in a row, leaving me unable to function during the day. being bored of my friends waking up at 11am to meet when i’ve been up for two days. wishing i had someone to talk to, mainly. i just cave in on myself when i’m alone at night- think nobody really understands my problems and if they do they can at least sleep it off. i just want this to stop or to be able to get xans again. i’ve talked to professionals and the best prescription they could give me is melatonin which does absolutely nothing. otc aids don’t work. i’m sick of being so sleep deprived and alone. i’m only 16, and this has been going on for too long. it can’t be good for me and it’s driving me insane.
Signal	And by evening time you feel fine and you’re like, okay it’s okay if I don’t sleep. Then the next morning you feel shitty again? I’ve felt awful all day, tried taking a nap twice and failed, and now it’s 439 and I’m feeling completely normal and not really tired at all.
NotSignal	okay so to start off i had a really rough time getting my sleep schedule back on track again and most of the posts on this sub has helped me loads. I'm now having no trouble with my sleep and boy am i relieved. So i wish the same for y'all and i hope you get over your insomnia asap. Thanks again!
Signal	I have been having progressively worsening insomnia for 3 months now. It started with muscle jerks that would wake me up just as I was falling asleep. I talked to my doctor who prescribed trazodone. It helped for several weeks. I'd get an average of 6-7 hours each night. Then it went to 4, and now none. Even with the trazodone I just won't sleep. It's like I get almost to the point of sleeping then I wake up. It happens multiple times an hour throughout the night. This past month I've noticed I get muscle twitching in my extremities, and have had personality changes (panic attacks, memory problems). I've now been prescribed Ambien. It will be my first time taking it tonight. I've also been referred to neurology, and for an MRI. To say I'm scared is an understatement. I'm scared the new medication won't work. That there is possibly a bigger problem going on. I'm not sure if this is a rant, or just me seeing if anyone else out there has experienced something like this. It truly is torture.
NotSignal	Like others, I've tried everything I could buy over the counter. I currently have Benadryl, Advil PM, and Zzzquil pills in my cabinet. I usually rotate between the three or combine them if it's badIf I take one for too long my body adapts and it won't work anymore
NotSignal	hi fellow reditters :) wanted to share something. something amazing happened to me last night where i fell asleep naturally without being on any medication and at a relatively happy time. I know yall are struggling and I've been there but know that things will turn good slowly. Just remember to not be anxious!!! I realised the number one reason why people have insomnia is because they are scared of not falling asleep(seems obvious but yeah), but at the end trust in your body and your instincts because i promise even if it doesn't feel like it you CAN fall asleep you just need trust, hope everyone has a good rest of the day :)
NotSignal	It's flaring again just after the winter break gave me peace, the bags were starting to go away. Now I'm back to maybe 5 or 6 hours. I'm having violent dreams. Multiple days in a row I've been getting impaled, sexually abused, concussed, pushed off high surfaces, put at gun and knife point. I've had various violent encounters with friends, people I haven't spoke to in years, people I walk by in hallways that I've never spoke to, and even experienced false awakenings with more. Melatonin and marijuana both don't work on me and make me even worse, being 16 in 2 weeks I don't know if it's my brain structure. I'm addition I'm having many complete dreams during my 10 to 30 minute naps. I don't think I'm stressed, like I explained above the break is over on the 6th, however all my summitives are done with no homework. I only have 1 exam in 3 weeks for my best subject but I could confidently take it right now. It's 1 am and I will edit if this happens in the morning.Edit January 4: Running somewhere on an infinite plane, not violent but still vivid and anxiety inducing
Signal	Yesterday I wanted to know my resting heart rate on a whim so I found one of those online counters and my pulse was 78bpm. Not great but not terrible.Today I took an Ambien to sleep but for whatever reason it acted completely different than normal. I took a 10mg and within minutes it was full force. It usually takes an hour to kick in. I know when it's working because it gives me double vision which is more extreme depending on how much it's working. Everything was very double.Within 10 minutes I was totally fucked up still getting ready for bed. I layed down but realized I couldn't get to sleep. A half hour later the Ambien was completely gone and I don't have a spare/want another one.It's been about another hour now and my pulse is over 90 and has been for as long as I've been counting. Just chilling here it's that high.I don't know why my pulse is so high and I don't know why the Ambien went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 in a half hour when it usually takes four hours.
Signal	so i have a girlfriend who's in turkey right now she's having severe insomnia she's only slept a handful of hours in the past week she has a history of suicidal thoughts and is talking about wanting to die and i don't know what to do
Signal	I study sports nutrition for health in UniversityI keep missing classes as I cannot sleep, this leads me to miss my labs, then I don't know the material for the essays and it just ends in a violent cycleSome nights I sleep well, about 50% of each week. Then the other half I'm sat awake all night, alone, as my partner sleeps soundlyRight now it is 5:03 am and I just cannot sleep, I am honestly so sick of this pattern
NotSignal	I’ve been on Seroquel and ambien for sleep, what would be a good reason to have my doctor to raise the dose of Seroquel? I feel like my body has gotten to use to the dosage I’m on and would like for it to be raised. Thanks
Signal	I'm stuck in a no sleep night because of a b#tch broken ankle that hurts so frickin much.`w.. I've got fibromyalgia as well, I'm on fire literally, feel like ants crawling all over me and I'm in a fire pit burning up can't get rid of the pain. Can't even imagine sleep at this point
NotSignal	I just want to share this with y'all because i made a mistake and it affects me to this day.So a few months back i was adapted to this very nocturnal schedule that was from about 5:00am-3:00pm and i was able to get about 9 hours of sleep.I soon realized how unhealthy that schedule was and was determined to change it up. So like all of y'all i came up with the idea of staying up for a long period of time and then sleep when my brain was ultra tired.This was probably the biggest mistake i made because after staying up for 40 hours straight, my mind was super messed up and in the end i managed to get barely 2 hours of sleep. I've been struck with insomnia ever since. I haven't still recovered as i still lack sleep. I wouldn't suggest going for chemical help because if you're not getting natural sleep, your body doesn't accept it. But i guess the only real way to recover to go for healthy measures like eating right and exercising, so I'm gonna stick to that and hope y'all got some sort of idea from this.
NotSignal	Anybody up and want to chat? I just found this subreddit and have been dealing with insomnia since I was a teenager. I don't know why it's never occured to me to search for an insomniac /r
NotSignal	I usually have a period of insomnia where I can't sleep for more than 6 hours for about 2-4 weeks 3 times a yearCurrently though I'm on 3 months of not getting more than 6 hours of sleep and it all started when I slept 4 hours one night (because stress/anxiety from 2 midterms that day) then the next day I didn't sleep at all (another midterm) and my sleep since those 2 days have never recovered
Signal	10 hours of crappy sleep where I am unable to even dream, where I feel like I am suspended in purgatory and wake up with the worst hangover.
NotSignal	My alarm clock goes off in 4 hours. At what point do I just stay up? I’m tired right. I’ll lay down and nothing will happen. I’m bored. So I just let my mind wander from topic to topic until I’m irritated and then I’ll just get up again. Ugh.
NotSignal	Ive been recently reading about a mushroom called Amanita Muscaria which is often called the "Sleep Mushroom" because it induces a really strong urge to sleep. Apparently it mimics the effects of drugs like alcohol or xanax and alleviates anxiety since it acts on you GABA receptors, but it doesnt have all of the nasty side effects of those substances. I am very curious about this because if it works, it would be absolutely game changing for me as I will no longer have to be reliant on prescriptions. If you have tried it, I would absolutely love to hear your thoughts.
NotSignal	I was thinking that because I'm sleeping at a time that I'm usually awake now, that it's just taking time for my circadian rythm to adjust so the sleep is light for now. I couldn't find any confirmation online.
NotSignal	My sleep has always been spotty throughout late spring and all of summer, mostly due to longer days. But this May has been especially bad with at least one sleepless night a week. I've tried pretty much everything except for medications/weed including breath exercises, meditation, magnesium, etc. and none of them have definite results. Why the rant? I'm now looking into CBT and need recommendations for the best self-therapy book. I'm not making much money right now due to the pandemic and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Have a good day (or night for my European friends) everyone and rest well.
NotSignal	I don’t see the point of owning one anymore. It’s honestly becoming a waste of space. I never fall asleep on it and just looking at it keeps me awake.
NotSignal	college female home because of rona. i've noticed it's a pattern with myself to sleep less and also not feel as hungry. But when i sleep more, I wake up and immediately want to eat. I used to think it was a mental health issue, but i've noticed i tend to sleep/eat less when I'm home with my parents and sleep/eat more up at college (roughly 6 hours away). does anyone else experience a phenomenon? whether it is environmentally effected or not? what are some ways you combat this? and is this a normal thing?
Signal	So recently I have been having trouble sleeping due to just outright fear, I was wondering if this would be classified under insomnia? Whenever I’m about to go to sleep, I feel hyper aware of my surroundings and if i don’t glance around my room then I’ll feel really scared or anxious. I already have a fucked up sleep schedule but I’ve managed to screw up even more. I can usually only sleep for increments of 4 hours before my body wakes up on its own, due to a time period where I get 3 to 4 hours of sleep regularly.On top of this I’m struggling to even fall asleep in the first place due to the fear. Even if this isn’t insomnia, would anyone be willing to give me any tips on how to deal with this? Thank you!
NotSignal	i’m so tired of this shit, i just want to lay in bed and fall asleep but even if i don’t drink anything, i pee like 3-4 times an hour. everything else is so uncomfortable already trying to sleep and my bladder decides to act like i drank 10 gallons of water before bed.
NotSignal	Hi friends! Who's awake? My husband passed out ages ago. I'm alone with my thoughts again. Sleep is not even in the radar. At least it's Friday and I'm not up early tomorrow.
NotSignal	I'll try to make the long story short and hope for some advice because doctors have proven clueless so far.&#x200B;For the past 4 years I've been feeling chronically fatigued. For the first 3 no one even suspected sleep issues because I seemed to sleep well, only in the last year, since my sleep has been getting worse, I've become aware it's shallow and I wake up during the night.&#x200B;I have no anxiety or depression, sleep apnea has been tested. Getting drunk or smoking weed helps - I feel best if I've gone to bed drunk or high. Somehow it seems to knock me out properly. Sleeping aids one doc prescribed to me worked for a month or so, but not anymore, I think I've developed a tolerance.&#x200B;I have no racing thoughts or worries about sleep, mostly I fall asleep fine and sometimes sleep seemingly undisturbed throughout the night, yet I always wake up tired! It's like some mechanism regulating sleep cycles has broken in my brain, and no one can explain to me how this could work!
Signal	The first two months of lockdown went fine. But suddenly i started experience sporadic insomnia. Didnt think much about it, but suddenly i’ve had it everyday for almost three weeks now. Dont have any problems falling asleep, but i wake up anywhere from 3-6 hour.Im getting some exercise, not to the same degree as before quarantine. Always been a little anxious and stressed, im maybe a bit Worse now at that front, especially because of the insomnia.Tried a bit more exercise, socialising, reduced anxiety, lavender oil, but it hasnt done anything. Any inputs?
NotSignal	I was wondering if anyone else experiences strange skin/bodily sensations that end up keeping them awake. A lot of the time my insomnia stems from simply an overactive mind, but sometimes there is more going on that makes me wonder if there's something more complex going on than simple anxiety. For the past two or three days I've experienced all of these symptoms at once when attempting to fall asleep. they seem to worsen the more tired I become:&#x200B;\- two or three second periods of intense nausea where it falls like something "snaps" in my brain. these usually completely wake me up and return me to full alertness. sometimes it feels as if my throat is closing up.\- burning sensations on the same spots on both sides of my legs that increase until they're hard to ignore.\- vertigo where it feels as if i am being spun upside down or swung off to one side.\- a tight, squeezing sensation on one side of my head.\- sudden and intense outbreaks of itching on my fingers, face, and seemingly anywhere.\- a sudden deep and uncomfortable pain in my right kneecap.\- small stabs of pain occurring in a seemingly random part of my body and then traveling.\- persistent spasms in my upper back.\- tingling of the arms and legs.\- burning sensations in my back, face, and arms.&#x200B;Could this really all just be down to anxiety and restlessness? I've had two or three occasions where these symptoms seem to flare up. They're fairly consistent and always manifest in the same places. I know it's probably a long shot because of specificity, but I was wondering if anyone had experienced anything in the same category and found something that helped.
Signal	Geez why is sleep such an impossibly precious breath to have when all the rest of the living universe freely partakes of it? Nope gotta be up all night like a dumb zombie lifeless and without any real meaning. Stupid cruelty. A morbid power born of hatred no doubt.
NotSignal	(Disclaimer: I do NOT have insomnia, just looking for general advice. Sorry if this does not belong here.)So, currently it's 5:13am. I just woke up from another horrible nightmare.The nightmares in and of itself aren't really that big of a deal, as I've had them since I was 14 (now 27), but what is starting to worsen are the negative thoughts that I start to experience whenever I try to relax my body.I can't really pinpoint exactly what they are, but it's getting to the point where I literally cannot close my eyes without seeing images of demons, deformed bodies and horrible car crashes.Tonight, I've tried several times just closing my eyes, thinking about cute puppies and beautiful mountains, but my head always bends those thoughts, and suddenly the puppies are strangled, the mountains are burning and everything is just terrible.This, obviously, wakes me up, and it absolutely infuriates me, because it makes no sense...I have considered going to a psychologist to actually figure out what is wrong with my head, and why silence, darkness and attempts to relax my body and mind always ends horribly, and if there is a connection to this with something else that has happened in my life at a previous moment.In general, I am a healthy and happy guy when I am awake. I go the gym, I have great friends, and I really don't have much to complain about.I have a few bad habits though, bad addictions in my life that I currently struggle with. Maybe that's why, maybe not. I have no idea...If anyone has ever experienced anything like this, or just have any advice in general, I would really appreciate it. I just want to go to sleep with a smile on my face, or at least without visualizing death and despair.
NotSignal	Hi so I know this sounds strange but hear me out. So the past year I have had pretty bad problems falling asleep so much so that sometimes I would stay up multiple nights in a row. This literally went on for months, and turned into an anxiety feedback loop, you know how it goes. I almost lost my sanity. Now, I'll spare you the details, but it just so happened that some night-owl worked in the bedroom while I tried to sleep one night. It was like 2 AM, and I couldn't fall asleep the whole time again, or so I thought, and just started crying of frustration. You know. But the person told me that I slept up until now just fine!? It turned out that I would just sleep in extremely short cycles, wake up, think I was awake the whole time, worry, and the whole thing again multiple times throughout the night. Learning that was honestly such a turning point. I know this is still a sleep disorder lol, but now every night the intervals get a little longer, now around 4hrs, and I wake up quite refreshed. Yeah, get someone to watch you sleep!! I hope this helps. Oh, and another thing: thank god for this community, for all of you. None of you deserve to suffer from insomnia, and to have your days compromised by it like that. Just something I would have liked to hear at my worst.
NotSignal	How do people cope with having to go to work and going on very little sleep? Serious question brcsuse today, that is me.
Signal	Whenever after class I have an eaaaaasy time sleeping. But at night however, when I'm already even more tired I CANT FUCKING SLEEP. Anyone else experiencing the same?
NotSignal	This doesn’t happen every night, it’s more like every 3-4 nights. When it happens I’ll have these visuals it kind of looks like static. It’s black and dark gray. The little particles float/ move around. When this happens my eyes won’t stay shut for some reason and they flutter open repeatedly. It’s like my mind won’t shut off. I’ll also have a song stuck in my head that won’t stop playing. It lasts for hours and I can’t sleep through it. I think it may be a side effect from my medication but I’m not sure. I only started experiencing this about six months ago. I don’t know how to stop it. Does anyone else experience this?
Signal	Might have accidentally took TWO of my morning anxiety and depression meds before bed rather than trazodone.. and it’s a stimulant... fml. Well, time to tough it out I guess.
NotSignal	Has anyone here taken Belsomra? If so, what were your results?
Signal	I don’t think I have insomnia per se, but some meds I take def fuck up my sleep as it is. This past Monday I lost a job that I loved and have been p depressed since. I can’t sleep at night but I’ll pass out come 7-9am. Today I slept until 6pm! I have a history of depression and anxiety and it’s rly fucking me up since I can’t seem to hold down a job but my husband and I need the second income (were financially stable for since we got a ton of money from the wedding a couple months ago but still).I’m looking into getting a therapist that can help w autism and/or job counseling. In the meantime tho does anybody have any tips for falling and especially staying asleep? Even when I sleep at a decent hour I wake up almost every night at 1am.I’m scared if I don’t fix this fixed soon it’ll hurt my chances of getting/keeping a job and I rly don’t want to spiral into a bad/lengthy depression again.
Signal	it started as an all nighter after christmas, i thought this was just a fun all nighter but then it happened again, and again, only sleeping about an hour in the afternoon. Its currently been 13 days since it started, I was able to atleast take small breaks to try to bring up my energy during the day. Now that school has started I can't anymore. It got worse on the night of the 5th. I went 37 hours with no sleep and then after that only one hour. I havent slept since that one hour. I have school in 2 hours. I feel like shit. I hate seeing the sun rise after another painful allnighter.
NotSignal	Is it still “insomnia” if you aren’t struggling to get to sleep — if you are just up all night for many nights but don’t feel like you really need to sleep?
Signal	Short details--been suffering horrible insomnia since surgery 12/27/2019. Getting maybe 2/3 hrs a night.Last night I had my first bout with hallucinations. They were fucking terrifying. I was wide awake. They were mostly visual but had a few later that were auditory.What do I do now? I can't cope with insomnia and hallucinations!
NotSignal	Honestly, I just can't seem to answer this question. I've struggled with insomnia for about a few years now. It's 5:30am now, been in bed since 11:30pm just rolling from one side to another, been awake for 16-17 hours now, and I have to get up at 6:30am for school. I really don't know what to do.
NotSignal	Like, I get some sleep but I end up just drifting off even during a full blown panic attack even though it takes me like 2 hours to get to sleep It just feels like someone whacked me over the head and not like consciously going to sleepI’m not complaining but I wonder how my brain does it
Signal	Does anyone have tips for how to deal with this? I'm not normally an insomniac but I just started college again and traveled to a +3 hour time zone within a week. The past few days I've gotten a pattern of waking up around 4 am unable to fall back asleep. I'm exhausted all day and at night I can't sleep. I'm not sleepy until it's about time for me to get up and go to class. I'm not drinking coffee or taking any medication.
Signal	Over the last couple of weeks, I've been really struggling to sleep properly. I've been slipping in and out of consciousness throughout the nights, and that's after taking way too long to fall asleep to start off with. This has made me super tired during the day, but due to still living with parents, I can't use the day to catch up with sleep.Since last night, it has gotten worse. It took me several hours to get to sleep and my eyes hurt from being open too much. At the time of writing this, it is currently 2:15 am, and I've been lying in bed since 11:00 pm... I'm too tired to do anything else, I'm going to have a job soon that will mean that I need to be there for 5:00 am, and I cannot continue like this. Does anyone have any idea what have caused this, and how I can sort it out?
NotSignal	It’s not even the anxiety or the physical issue of my insomnia that’s been going on for years anymore, it’s just with constant 2-4 hour nights, 8 hours feels like a blessing that I’ll never be able to get back :(.
Signal	For almost 6-7 months, I'm not able to sleep uninterrupted. I've always used to have trouble just getting to sleep and I was fine with that. I'll just take how many hours I get, but now I wake up almost every 2 hours. I don't know if this is insomnia or some other sleep disorder. See, some nights i sleep at 3 am and I have to wake up at 8 but I'll get interrupted in between my sleep.Other nights when I sleep at around 11 (rarely). I'll wake up at least twice in between. It's been bugging me now since I have online classes to attend and I'm just drowsy all day. Some help would be appreciated. Thanks.
Signal	Yeah i don't think I need to say much more than the title does, I am physically drained and exhausted but yet again I just can't fall asleep. I have tried for 7 hours now and I guess I'll have to accept that I must stand up in 40 minutes, sleepless of course. Wish me luck people, I'll need every single bit of it. And to all of you experiencing the same shit everyday, try to keep positive, even if everything seems fucked up because you're either tired, or awake when you shouldn't be.
Signal	It’s nearly 4 am and I can’t sleep. I took some pills to help me sleep and still I am up. I am just tired
Signal	I’m bipolar and just got diagnosed with psychophysiological insomnia. I’ve had trouble sleeping my whole life because I just can’t get tired or I think too much and usually get restless.Just started taking prazosin but something about it is weird... I don’t notice any side effects when I take it an hour or two before bedtime, but when I go to sleep I usually wake up once in the middle of the night to everything looking kind of ... weird ... like I’m tripping. My perception of where things are in relation to me is off. My arms look too long. My boyfriend sleeping next to me looks too small to be him. And things look like they’re moving too. The design on my blanket dances around. When I shift my legs around, the movement of the blanket doesn’t seem to match what I felt my legs do.It’s all just very weird but I’ve learned to enjoy the strangeness of it instead of freaking out like I did the first time. It usually only happens once a night and I am always able to go back to sleep minutes later. But I’m curious... does anyone else experience anything like this with prazosin or anything similar?
Signal	I feel extremely exhausted but i cant get any sleep.Yesterday i slept 4 hours or so, and I thought that would make me fall asleep early today, but its 5 am in my zone and i still havent slept at allIm feeling more and more anxious every hour that i stay awake. When i think im falling asleep something in my brain makes me wake up, my body suddenly starts trembling or i feel an horrible fright and suddenly im completely awake againI have anxiety and depression thar may explain the situation, but i still worry that i may be losing my mind or becoming crazy, that there is something wrong with my brainSorry for the long post and thank you for reading, it means a lot, really
NotSignal	I have sleep-onset insomnia. Sometimes it takes me two or three hours to drop off. What are your suggestions for techniques to fall asleep quicker, particularly in relation to racing thoughts? I have tried the following which fluctuating success:(a) Thinking in images rather than words (so trying to ignore or interrupt my inner voice);(b) Focusing on breathing;(c) Looking into the black space of the closed eyelids and seeing patterns.I have had the most success with (a) but I still have nights where it takes me ages to fall asleep.
Signal	I don't know if I truly have insomnia or not, but for some reason I can never get tired, no matter how late it gets. It's 4:30 AM, I have my first class at 10:00 AM, and I don't know what to do. This has been going on for weeks now. I've tried almost every type of sleep-aid you can think of. Melatonin, Diphenhydramine, even benzodiazepines. You name it; I've probably tried it. I just don't get tired. If anything, they'll make me incredibly drowsy and/or light-headed, but even when I try to fall asleep, I just can't do it. As drowsy as they make me, I never get tired.Does anybody have any advice, maybe another possible sleep-aid or method of falling asleep that has worked for them?
Signal	My depression and anxiety has been very high lately. Mostly due to coronavirus fears. Last night I couldn't sleep until 10:30PM and woke at 3AM! A little less than 5 hours of sleep according to my fitbit. I just tried taking an early afternoon nap and I still can't call asleep! I'm worried about tonight. Should I take 1mg melatonin or 0.5mg Xanax or 50mg benadryl?
NotSignal	I'm a 14 year old and struggle to sleep with this I have only had this for 3 days does anyone have any tips to stop thinking about it.
NotSignal	I'm struggling to stay coherent....but you know how your brain automatically blocks you from always noticing your nose? When I'm really sleep deprived like right now my brain forgets? And I keep seeing my nose....and blinking takes ages instead of it being unnoticed I briefly notice my eyelids are closed....sorry if this is rambling just exhausted thoughts
NotSignal	Hey guys, fellow insomniac here, spend a lot of my late hours on twitch streaming me playing with friends on fortnite. Feel free to come chat and hangout @ [resident ginger !](Twitch.tv/resident_ginger)
Signal	I seem to have at least one night a week where I can only sleep around 3 hours or I sleep for 3 hours and wake up for around 3-4 hours and go back to sleep for another 4 hours after that. I've been suffering from PTSD and heart palpitations. I also have a bit of debt, a poor job and a poor relationship with my parents who I still live with. I've been speaking to a counselor since May and it's been kind of helpful, but nothing major. I want to find a better job but these sleep issues are so demoralizing, making me think: How will I succeed at a new job if I am not sleeping soundly? I was thinking about getting a sleep study done, but I don't have insurance and when I did my doctor told me they would not cover it if I have a history of anxiety and depression. I'm looking into charity coverage that would help me pay for a sleep study hoping that will lead to some answers. Have any of you guys had a sleep study and was it helpful?
NotSignal	Since I became teenager some nights we're really hard to sleep in, Like I can't describe it I can't sleep that easily and find falling asleep hard unless I'm dead tired.
NotSignal	So basically for the past 2 - 3 years I’ve been experiencing (approximately once a week) extremely taunting and frustrating night terrors.y nightmares usually always go the same, first it begins with a situation where my Mum does something her and I know will antagonise and emotionally scar me (leaving me behind and driving off) but shows no empathy when I become distraught &/or she returns. The dreams always end just when I’m red as a tomato angry bout to dip out.. causing me to wake up so angry and just emotionally frusturated to an extent I punch the wall or yell at the top of my lungs. After 5 minutes I forget why I even did it but eventually it comes back to me.. so it’s been going on for 3 years now & I moved out of home approximately 4 years ago and haven’t stAyed with either of my parents since (They’re seperated)
NotSignal	I think I'm gonna die soon guys........ Im 100% sure I have SFI..... I have all the symptoms and I'm shaking alot right now. I'm sorry everyone I'm so sorry I love all you guys Evey single one of you! What a time to be alive am I right :)
Signal	I worked last night and am tonight as well, 7pm to 7am. Today I had stuff to do in the afternoon so I took lunesta, klonopin, the OTC sleep aid that is really just an antihistamine I can’t remember the name of it. Anyway I slept 5 hours today, and won’t be working a night shift until next Monday.My plan: stay awake until 9pm tomorrow night, and hopefully sleep without any sleep meds at all. Any advice to keep me up but not have a caffeine induced anxiety attack?Thanks!
Signal	My anxiety Insomnia has been getting bad since this virus chaos and to make it worse we can't go seek doctors like we used to. Has anybody been doing those online video chats with a Psychiatrist? i feel strange to trusting and opening up to a person over some video chat
Signal	my husband has had really bad insomnia for a while. It doesn’t seem to even relate much to stress, it can happen after a perfectly fine day. He has tried many medications which he inevitably builds up immunity to, and he would like to wean off them at some point. He seems to have found the cure...sex. Specifically vaginal sex, blowjobs and masturbation don’t help. We already have daily sex. Last night he woke me up at 1 am for sex (I was exhausted so I gave him a blowjob) and then woke me up again at 4 for sex (I don’t remember this but apparently I ignored him.)I don’t mind doing this, I love having sex w him, but I’m pregnant and it’s pretty difficult for me to even wake up when he asks. I told him it’s ok to have sex with me when I’m sleeping. But honestly I’m curious to know why this is?? I mean nothing else works for him, why sex?
NotSignal	Wanna p.m. me who also accepted the fact they wont sleep?
Signal	Low dose seroquel as needed for sleep?25 yo, otherwise healthy male.. very active, never had sleep issues until the past 6 months when I was diagnosed with Graves’ disease/ hyperthyroidism. It’s being treated, and my bloodwork is almost back to normal, however, sleep is still an issue, and particularly anxiety about whether or not I’ll be able to sleep.Trazodone + melatonin & some various herbal tinctures are usually sufficient.OTC antihistamines don’t really work for me. Occasionally, I need something a bit stronger to calm my mind and put me to sleep. I was using Ativan occasionally, but chose to discontinue that due to concerns of dependency with benzos. My doctor just prescribed my 25 mg seroquel to take as needed. I’ve read so many conflicting things about this drug, and I’m not sure what to think at this point. I plan to start with 6.25 mg (1/4 pill), and only use as needed, hopefully no more than a couple times a week. Does this dosage / frequency put me at risk for dependency for sleep, or any kind of rebound anxiety or insomnia? If not, what dose would I have to worry about that with? Is discontinuing low dose seroquel as hard as people make it sound? I really don’t want to start something that I will be dependent on. Will this dosage cause any change in my mood / cognitive function throughout the day( aside from feeling better from actually sleeping)? If not, what dose would ?How much of a concern are diabetes, Tardive Dyskinesia, weight gain, etc.. on this dose? What doses do they become more likely at?Is there anything else that you’d suggest as a a strong, as needed, non addictive sleep aid that doesn’t result in any rebound anxiety or insomnia?
Signal	Hey everyone, I’m currently 162.5mg IR Seroquel and 15mg Mirtazapine.Stats:1. 28 years old2. Male 3. 220lbs, low body fatI was hospitalized in October for debilitating tinnitus-induced insomnia and at that time, was on 300mg Seroquel. In a month I dropped down to 250, then in another month down to 225. For all intents and purposes I basically stayed on this dose until April 1st, when I dropped down to 200mg. I am 7 1/2 months in now and just dropped to ~162.5 last night. I am dropping in 12.5mg increments. I’m glad I’ve been reducing the dose because around the end of March, I noticed a VERY SLIGHT tremor in my hand when using a dropper for skin care. This tremor has become more pronounced and when I lift weights my whole body feels like it’s shaking with certain exercises. When I flex my arms my hands will shake a lot, but this is completely absent at rest—only then will I get an occasional jerk/twitch of a random muscle group every four hours or so. I’ve been lifting for 12 years and have never experienced this sensation. It is incredibly upsetting and I fear that this will be a long-lasting or permanent EPS of Seroquel. So I would be stuck with a banshee in my ear and the inability to control my musculature. Awesome.However, because of the reduction dates and timing of this symptom’s appearance, I can’t accurately say whether this is a withdrawal or a tardive side effect of quetiapine.My questions for people who have been on seroquel: did you ever experience this trembling/twitching/shaking? Did it appear late? Did it appear during withdrawal? Did it get worse or better as you decreased? Did it dissipate?I also have pretty constant tachycardia (~120bpm) and wake up with horrible anxiety every morning. I’m not sure if this is a side effect or part of withdrawal either. Thanks in advance.
Signal	after a week of restless sleep and feeling awake but im sure i was asleep i gave in and took melatonin. Best sleep all week but i really dont want too become depended on them so anyone know how many days should i take them before my body becomes too depended on them?
Signal	Hey all. With my job closing down and my uni SS well my sleep schedule has been completely out of wack. I’ve picked up some melatonin pills and have some questions about them? So for one, I can’t take pills. Would crushing them up and putting them in water a suitable way to take them? And if I don’t have a pill crusher what’s a good way to crush them?Second, are there any sided decay like weight gain or mental mess ups? I know I could probably look this up online but was wondering if anyone here had experience with them first hand.Thanks. And if you know another sub that could help with this please tell me.
NotSignal	Ok so I looked this up and Mr.google kept giving results for ppl that shake their legs in their sleep, but for me I can NOT even fall asleep without shaking either one leg or foot or both legs and feet, it’s distressing and quite tiring. I find myself doing it without even realizing that I’m doing it, once my legs or feet begin to tire and get sore I stop but still can’t fall asleep without doing it. Once I start after 15-30 mins then I drift into sleep 😡. I don’t understand it, and I wouldn’t mind if it wasn’t so tiring. Plus now I find myself shaking my leg and rubbing my hands or just doing something with my limbs unconsciously.
Signal	My antidepressants and anxiety meds cause insomnia and I already had insomnia to begin with. It’s getting so bad that I’ll fall asleep mid conversation during the day but at night nothing works. I start college in August and I feel like I won’t be able to stay awake in class.
Signal	Ok so I used to have really bad sleeping problems and then I got prescribed seroquel it helped for a long time but recently I haven’t been able to sleep again I was wondering maybe if it’s the timing? Like I’m not sure what’s best to take it a few hours before sleep or 20 mins before? Maybe I just got used to it and need a higher dose? Any advice helps ty<3
Signal	So I’m 22, and started developing sleeping issues when I was 16 and in grade 11. I suddenly had an impossible time falling asleep. I’d get to sleep around 2am and need to wake up for 7... For a while, I woke up on time (it was really difficult) and made it to school. The sleep deprivation eventually caught up with me but no matter how tired I was, I couldn’t fall asleep early and instead would sleep in past my alarm. I ended up missing classes and eventually had to drop out in grade 12 because my sleep schedule was absolutely backwards. Obviously this was a huge problem and I was in therapy, saw a psychologist and prescribed sleeping pills. Without going into detail, none of those things helped - meds had awful side effects, therapist sucked and psychologist retired after the first time I saw him and now I don’t have insurance. I’ve tried meditation, melatonin, ASMR, the whole “no screen time before bed” thing, trying to get into a routine, counting, breathing exercises... NOTHING helped long term. I cannot fall asleep before 4am, ever. Once I’m asleep I don’t wake up and can sleep for 12hours or more. Sometimes I won’t sleep at all and the next night I STILL can’t fall asleep until 4am. I used to get anxiety when it was bedtime because I knew I’d try so hard and nothing would work, and now I don’t even try anymore. Most days I wake up at 3pm. I had to drop out of college and I can’t get a job. Drs don’t know what to tell me other than what they already have. My friends and family think I’m lazy. It’s obviously had a huge toll on my mental health and my future and I feel like I’m missing out on life. Is anyone else going through something similar?
Signal	Its in incredible how my mind works. I could have fell asleep, but I didnt.Im so tired and WAS so sleepy. But i’m now afraid of sleeping and letting go. ._. So im just staring at the ceiling with my drink in the hands. (cause yes im crazy enough to dry to get drunk so I could fall asleep or at lest being less anxious about it).
NotSignal	I have a hard time falling asleep, once i do fall asleep i could easily sleep for 12 hours. My record was 19 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Once I am asleep, I can't wake up unless I have to, but it is very difficult. On weekends I have to catch up on sleep, and sleep 12 hours at least.I stopped taking naps at 2 years old. Starting 5 years old, I went to bed at every night 9:00pm and fell asleep ever night by 12-1am.I've tried over the years to correct my sleep habits but with no luck. Im 29 years old now. Exercise and diet doesn't have any effect on my sleep quality.Do I have a sleep disorder? What should I do? I heard sleep medicine is not a long term solution.

Signal	Last night it happened again. Tossing and turning, sweating a puddle, aching muscles and joints. I feel like I'll go a couple of days with actual "sleep", maybe 5 or 6 hours, then its right back to falling asleep for an hour and having my eyes snap wide open. I have to start getting ready for work in 30 minutes. I dont even realize I'm typing right now. I feel like I'm in a video playing on tv. Everything is slower and I dont know what I need to do to make this stop. I see so many people talk of living with insomnia for 10+ years. I'm really proud of those who live through something like that but I've been doing this for about 4 years now and I dont think I can take much more. I can tell my body has become so unhealthy and weak since my insomnia began. I faint constantly and feel dizzy all the time. I cant be as physical as I used to. Its effecting my relationships and work so severely. I sound like a broken record. I would trade anything to make this stop.
Signal	Hi. Title pretty much explains it for you... I’m a 20 year old female and for the past several days I have laid in bed when I’m ready to fall asleep only to NEVER actually fall asleep. Except maybe for a few hours at 5 am from exhaustion. Not being able to fall asleep is bad enough, but when I finally do fall asleep I wake up within 1-2 hours and feel refreshed... this has been severely messing with my sleep schedule, because I get completely exhausted by the middle of the day and usually take a nap. But because of this nap I somehow can’t get tired enough to fall asleep in bed later that night. Please help me out?
Signal	Suffering from chronic insomnia and weak sleep is their a fix for it ? Should I take sleep medication ? I have tried them before but they make me groggy when I woke up. The chronic insomnia usually happens when my sleeping schedule changes but sometimes it doesn't go away
NotSignal	I sleep like a baby most nights. but about a month ago, during lockdown, my sleep just fell apart somewhat. Been getting circa 5 hours a night at best and it's manageable but annoying.I think I'm getting depressed/lonely in lockdown, but it's so weird that the only thing that changed was my location and hanging out with my parents for the week, working from home there instead, and I was sleeping like a baby every night. Falling asleep in minutes, staying asleep almost all night. Felt like myself again.Drove home last night, got in to bed all confident I'd beaten this wave of insomnia but nope. Tossing and turning until 2am again.I hate the brain. It's not like I lay there worrying or thinking, just doing exactly what I was doing at my parent's place but just won't fall asleep.Yet there, boom, asleep in minutes.*sigh*
NotSignal	As per my other post, need to make changes to my meds but currently at a loss for a long-term sleep aid medication. Due to my other diagnoses I am extremely limited to what meds I can take. Thank you.
Signal	I've always had trouble sleeping, always been a light sleeper. It's never been a completely incapacitating problem, not severe, and I've found ways to make it work, such as taking naps and using a cycle of supplements which work ok. However, after a recent rough spell I told my psych about my ongoing sleeping problems and she prescribed me Gabapentin. I was super hesitant to take it as it is supposed to be for seizures? Anyway, I finally took it, and these past three nights I have slept like never before...I'm honestly so shocked. I've NEVER slept this well in all my life...it's making me reconsider everything, including my ADHD diagnosis and even the bouts of depression? Wondering if anyone else has had this revelation, and what it all means? I do not want to become dependent on a medication for sleep, but the sleep is so good.. its frustrating and amazing at the same time. TIA
NotSignal	Anyone have experience using Viibyrd as a sleep aid (attempting to grt off ambiien)?That's for the wisdom of the thread
Signal	I’ve see so many sleeping pills. Trazodone, Ambien, Lunesta, benzos, Sonata, Rozerem, Silenor, Doxylamine, Diphenhydramine, etc. Is any consensus on what helps out you to sleep and help you stay asleep without much tolerance/addiction?
Signal	What the hell do you do? This pandemic is making it worse for sure. Weed doesn't help, no OTC sleep aid helps, cough syrup doesn't help, whenever I use zopliclone ( I've been on it for years ) I quickly build a tolerance so I'm on a tolerance break right now, so I feel like I'm out of options. I've been an insomniac since I was 13, and now I'm sick and tired of being exhausted, feeling the bags under my eyes and not being able to sleep. If I do manage to sleep it'll be like three hours or less, and I am incapable of napping during the day altogether so I don't really catch up on sleep.I'm tired and desperate and could use some help. :(
NotSignal	Trazadone? Idk he suggested this and I said no but now I’m reconsidering
NotSignal	Every night when I try to go to sleep, it feels like I’m half awake? One time my sister told me I was sleeping the whole time. She opened my door and found out I was snoring but I swear I was awake because I could feel myself moving around trying to find the right sleeping position. I could even feel my breath. I was tossing and turning. The weird part is that I had a dream at while I was awake??? I’m so confused
Signal	Ideally, I'd like to avoid z-drugs, and benzos. Though I'm not against other gabaergics such as pregabalin. Also there is no way I'm gonna take anti-psychotics either. So what options do I have here?I ran out of mirtazapine & zopiclone a couple days ago, and am meeting with a sleep specialist later today. So I could either ask for a refill, or switch meds. I'd like to take something other then mirt as I've gained too much weight since I started to take it. In my experience mirtazapine induced food cravings/munchies are comparable to cocaine cravings. So I'd like to avoid being gluttonous and wasting my money on food.Any thoughts on medication that has been beneficial for you?Non-prescription pharms such as weed, alcohol, and benadryl don't do anything for me.
NotSignal	No matter how tired I am. No matter what time I go to bed. No matter what I eat, drink, or don't eat or drink. No matter what mental exercises I try. Two hours minimum of just laying there in the dark.
Signal	So im currently on zopiclone but to avoid addiction i do an interval of 2 days on 1 day on. During the "dry" days i cant really sleep for more than 2 hours at a time, and i ironically keep having nightmares about not being able to sleep and being kept from deep sleep. Its really feeding into my anxietys about bedtime and is therefor extremely counterproductive. Im also scared it means itll be harder to wane off the medication since ill relate not taking a pill before bed with having nightmares. Anyone else who can relate? I do struggle with both depression and anxiety, and its very centered around bedtime rn? Has anyone found a way to cope?
Signal	I am not into supplements because honestly they don’t work or they are bullshit. But I was so fucking desperate after starting yet another anti depressant that didn’t work. I got a gaba supplement. I took gabapentin and that helped but I had to keep taking more and more and the withdrawal was terrible. I figured if that worked maybe the gaba supplement might. It kinda worked. I didn’t feel that disconnect I have between my mind and body when I went to bed. My problem isn’t a sernetonin problem it’s a gaba problem? I have no idea. But I got one night and I’m taking the goddamn victory.
Signal	I found that as I age, my body is immune to melantonine and sleep induced supplements like magnesium or tea.For the past few months I’ve been having traveling itch on my body . Itch appears on leg, after scratching it , another can be felt at my neck . It goes on and on all over my body .Anybody experienced that and how to cure it ?
NotSignal	Hi everyone, I’ve struggled with insomnia on and off my whole life, but the last 5 weeks sticking to a strict sleep consolidation programme as I’ve been In crisis the last 3 months. It’s pretty tough going and I can’t seem to get to a sleep efficiency place where I can finally extend my sleep. I had 4 good nights in a row last week which is huge for me, but then I think the pressure of “improving” and keeping up my sleep efficiency backfired and now I’m back to watching the sun come up and feeling absolutely terrible physically and mentally. I have done CBT for my anxious thoughts and “worry time” during the day, but I find it hard to do this when I’m “in the thick of it” in the middle of the night. I just can’t help but ruminate on the sleep I’m not getting and beat myself up for not sleeping and ruining my sleep efficiency. I just want a practical way to stop these thoughts in their tracks. I get up when I can’t sleep and I have a little table of magazines and sudoku but when I’m anxious like this I just can’t feel relaxed while doing these. Does anyone have any practical tips?
Signal	I take seroquel now for sleep and last nightI took it at 10 30 pm and at 12 midnightI tried to sleep and I did eventually butwhen I woke by 6 am I felt like poorsleep, weird dreams and feel likeI did not sleep. I do worry but was relaxed when I layed down. Feel like I won’t sleep again. Did a lot yesterday too and walkedfor exercise. Can anyone offer help?I quit a benzo used for sleep.
NotSignal	Hi, About two months ago, I remembered I had like 1-2 weeks where I just couldn’t sleep. Like, I tried every technique there is, and still takes hours and hours and hours to fall asleep. Now, I sleep normally like I used to, around 8 hours. The way I gotten over my insomnia may sound cliche or easy, but if im being for real, it’s the fact that I try to hard to sleep that I couldn’t sleep. It’s different and subjective for everyone, but for me, the reason why I couldn’t sleep was worrying about not sleeping. I remembered I would just close my eyes and for hours I’m just begging to fall asleep, and unfortunately, that did not work. After a week or so, I had this mindset “Well if I’m not gonna sleep today,that’s fine. There’s always next time, and if that doesn’t work, then oh well.” I feel like that careless mindset is the reason I started actually falling asleep, because my mind is always so focused on these “breathing sleeping techniques” on how to sleep faster, or simply stressing about how many hours of sleep I would get per day if I were to fall asleep right now. If you guys have any questions, feel free to ask :)
Signal	I'm happy that I don't have to struggle with falling asleep anymore, but it's so annoying that I wake up multiple times at night. Its really taking a tole on my energy. Can anyone recommend what to take in order to stay asleep the whole night? The only thing that's helped is taking nyquil while sick, but I've heard its not recommended to keep using it every night.I hate sleeping, honestly. I know I have to sleep, though.
Signal	I take 3,5 mg of zolpidem (ambien) and get terrible muscle jerks and twitches all the time. Is there a way to stop them? I feel like I'm going insane and I can't even nap during the day because of them. I even went to the ER yesterday but they've told me it's nothing serious.
NotSignal	I guess I'm looking for explicit instructions on what to do. Ive been experiencing muscle tremors, a bleak depression and anxiety for these 3 days now. I feel like a zombie just surviving moment to moment. I have a feeling this is going to end with me in the ER, asking for something to knock me out but not given anything. I think I could probably bear one more night of sleeplessness before going, buy maybe I shouldnt. Thanks dawgs.
NotSignal	I finally met some people to hang out with and not be so lonely. They gather on Friday nights and I was supposed to meet up with them today, but now I don’t know if I will. I’m running on about 4 hours of sleep and I feel like shit.I absolutely hate this... Friday is the one day that I can meet up and have some sort of social life, and insomnia is ruining that too. *sigh*
Signal	I’m 18F, and always suspected issues with anxiety etc. My sleep has been bad for a few years; I get nightmares at least 1-2 times a month, used to be 2times a week. While I never had trouble falling asleep (usually takes 20-30min depending on how tired i am), I always struggled with staying asleep. I’d go to bed at 10-11pm, wake up around 1-3am and sleep again until 5am (thats when I wake up). But for around 6weeks now, this has become worse. I’ve not been able to sleep longer than 4h at once; usually, it’s around 1-2h I sleep at once. I’d get to bed at midnight and sleep until 1-2am, try again and wake up at 3-4am. I usually stay awake then, and take a nap before breakfast. But I sleep for maybe 5h a day at most.Should I go to the doctors? Can I just take sleeping pills to stay asleep?
NotSignal	Like tonight I was still tossing and turning at 2am so I forced myself to lay still and close my eyes and then opened them again and it was 3:30. Then I closed my eyes again and checked the time and it was 4:30. I feel like I slept but not really, like if someone whispered my name I would hear them and answer. I also had a dream but I don’t know if that was me just thinking about the show I watched today or if it was actually a dream. I was supposed to wake up at 5am today anyways and conveniently “woke up” at 4:30 so here I am right now waiting for my alarm to go off yay
NotSignal	1. Caffiene - drink 1 cup in the morning.. nothing more.2. Alcohol will stop working like every other medication.3. Never mix sleeping pills with alcohol. It can kill you and almost did me.4. Try not to get stressed. Anything that ticks you off avoid it. Don't watch the news.. don't argue with people. Just ignore/avoid everything that causes stress.5. Find a job that understands there will be times you can not come to work. Your best bet is to be self employed or work for a union that has FMLA protections.6. Some of the better medications I have taken in descending order are Belsomra, Trazadone, Seroquel. Seroquel works great but has horrific side effects. Should only be taken as a last resort. Belsomra is good because it feels like you naturally fall asleep and are not being put to sleep.7. If you spend time thinking/studying about things. Stop several hours before bedtime and do activities that require no thought like watching tv.8. Make sure your bed is comfortable. Get a memory foam mattress topper. They are cheap and really make your bed more comfortable. Memory foam pillows are great too.9. Get yellow tinted glasses and wear them when looking at screens. Wear them 2 hours before bedtime when doing anything.10. Time release melatonin is better than not time release melatonin.11. Magnesium.. take it daily a few hours before bed. In general make sure all you are getting all your electrolytes.12. This might sound crazy but recently I discovered if you protect your head from electromagnetic radiation ( cellphone/wifi ) it helps. It is called faraday fabric. Welcome to the tin foil hat club. I only do this at night.13. If you awake in the middle of the night and 'know you aren't going back to sleep' get up and do something. After a hour or two you will likely feel like you can sleep again. Go lye down then. If you do not feel like you can sleep again just stay up and hope for better luck that night.14. NEVER TAKE NAPS - EVER.15. Stop eating 5-6 hours before bedtime.16. Sometimes it takes combinations of different sleeping pills. Always consult your doctor before mixing pills on your own. 17. Always double check online to make sure there are no known drug interactions with whatever you have been prescribed. ALWAYS.. DO NOT FIND THIS OUT THE HARD WAY
NotSignal	I've been wondering if anyone else has this experience, and what to do about it.Basically, as I am trying to fall asleep, I hear a loudish noise, it's about the volume of someone speaking to you from about 5-8 feet away. Weirder is that it is always the strangest noise. It's different each time, from a person gasping to a paper crumpling and even an automated text to speech voice saying 'carpet', what I hear is completely unpredictable. It wakes me up every time and it's stopping me from sleeping, despite how tired I am; they're inconsistent so when it starts happening I usually flinch awake, and this can happen at any hour of the day.I've had a history of sleep paralysis, but it's definitely not that. I have full control over the movement of my body and the noises only happen when I'm closing my eyes, plus the only hallucinations I've had during sleep paralysis have been tactile. Only lead I have on this is I stopped taking an antidepressant recently, and I know those can affect your REM sleep, mine was at a pretty high dosage too. Does anyone have a label for this? Or experienced something similar? It's always keeping me on edge, especially since some of the things I've heard have been pretty freaky (i.e. a person yelping in pain or a gunshot or something snapping) and is costing me a lot of sleep or making me afraid to sleep in the first place.
Signal	Last year i started having problems sleeping so on and off i toke benzodiazepines. In September i woke up unable to produce full urine release. Then i about a week later i had bowels problems i had to start using suppositorys. I started loosing weight 6 pounds in one week this went on for 3 months i lost 30 lbs. In December i started gaining weight back. I also have increased thirst and chronic dry eyes. My memory lacks and every day between 2 and 5 i feel like my head is gonna explode. I also dream all night long vivid dreams. Also developed rapid muscle loss have problems with memory. My voice gets hoarse. Any idea what this could be i thought sporadic insomnia due to rapid weight loss to due to sleep. I've had every blood test mri and they cant seem to diagnose.
NotSignal	I kind of want to know about anyone’s specific stories or moments when they realized that they had insomnia. For me it was about 5 years ago when I couldn’t sleep and had watched the sun rise and the reason of ‘you’re just on your electronic before bed’ was no longer an applicable reason. Honestly thought it was insane, i kept checking my clock seeing it was 2am with no sleep and having to go to school the next day us when I realized this wasn’t some abnormality it was insomnia and it wasn’t going to go away. Not really interesting, but a story nonetheless. Anyone else got anything?
Signal	I’m 21 years old and have had insomnia since I was 14, although it reached its worst when I was 19.Over the years I’ve found myself having greater and greater cognitive issues, the most worrying being my apparent loss of vocabulary. I’m always finding it hard to remember words and the meaning of words that used to be more familiar. My neurologist told me that when my sleep becomes normal then all cognitive problems will go away. But I’m really not so sure.
Signal	hi all, here’s a quick summary of my sleep issues from the past to most recently:- had my tonsils and adenoids out because of strep and the snoring - later developed insomnia in my freshman year of high school and would twist and turn, some nights i wouldn’t even fall asleep - the insomnia has been present up until now- i am now 19, out of high school, and noticed this issue started during the corona virus quarantine. - now i am able to fall asleep at around 12-1 am, some nights waking up multiple times in the middle of the night to fall right back asleep, but aside from the rare few times i wake up at a normal time, i wake up at anywhere from 11-4 pm, and i feel like crap!! my face and under eyes are super puffy, my sinuses are stuffed, my back aches like i’m 90 not 19. from what my parents have told me, they’re unable to wake me up, so i guess i’m in this super deep sleep. i also seem to have very vivid dreams that sometimes leave me feeling sad when i eventually wake up. i also wake up feeling tired, and then end up sleeping again at some point, just for a little nap. but those two hours of sleep also have me vividly dreaming. i will take ANY advice i can get. my dr might be referring me to have a sleep study done but until then i don’t know how much longer i can deal with this, i would honestly much rather not sleep at all again. i’ve tried melatonin, remfresh, and ramadol (?) all of which made me wake up feeling like (you guessed it) crap! i’m open to trying anything to get some better sleep even just for one night.

NotSignal	Happy New Year up all night 6:30 am aaaackkkk... . how are people supposed to live without sleep?
NotSignal	I have always been this way. Its like the lottery. Sometimes I wake, I can get right back to sleep. But like the lottery, the chances are not that much.
NotSignal	I have another health issue that conflicts with sleep medication, I can take it but it makes life unpleasant. Not to mention the pills seem to have do more than they bargain for; if I take them I'll sleep alright, right through the alarm clock that has been going off for an hour straight. I'm writing this on my 50th hour with no sleep. I don't even feel tired right now but I'm pretty sure that's not a good thing. Been the second time this week that its happened so pretty much I've been awake for 80 percent of it. I really wish I wasn't so against the medication and I hate to be so discreet but the pills interfere with another issue I have and the doctors are aware and they basically told me to pick the lesser of two evils. For a while smoking weed gave my brain that one thing it needed to shut down but it doesn't do the trick anymore, it just makes the physical pain of being awake for so long a lot easier to manage. I need to sleep though. I work from 6am until 2am more often than not which has been making it even worse considering there is no way in hell I'm going to be able to shut my eyes for an hour or so before work so there are days I go to work without sleeping for 36 hours. I just need sleep.
Signal	Ive had awful insomnia for the past year where im regularly up for 2-4 or 5 days straight and once even 7. Theres been no time in the past year that ive slept two nights in a row, and when i do sleep its for 1-4 hours. I had been on ambien, lunesta, topamax, trazodone, abilify, lamictal, gabapentin, doxepin, and more to try and help it, but nothing worked. My psychiatrist was unwilling to try anything else at this point and referred me to cognitive behavioral therapy, which i have been doing, but obviously it did not fix my problem. Finally decided to take matters into my own hands and bought some seroquel and lyrica off the internet. I know thats not necessarily the best way to do things but i was desperate. I got it close to 2 weeks ago and have slept like a baby every night since, much better than even before my insomnia started. Its so amazing
Signal	Well, I hate myself for this but it puts me to sleep faster than anything but gives me insomnia once I wake up and now my boyfriend says he won't be able to sleep well because of this.
Signal	for the past 5 days i can't sleep for whatever reason. i may have developed insomnia. it's currently 3am in my place and my neighbors are being really loud and i can't sleep. i keep stressing out about something and i don't know what it is. my brain keeps reminding me of something embarrassing from 6 years ago. if anyone knows how to cure this, please let me know.
Signal	Im a young 19 year old who has had sleeping problems for the past year. First in November of last year, now again currently. Last year my insomnia was cured by taking amitriptyline, in which I was able to sleep 8 hrs again everyday. Now I started getting severe migraines and was prescribed topamax for it, but while that was happening I got insomnia again. I started taking amitriptyline again but my sleep's been on and off, and now it doesn't work for me anymore. I wake up repeatedly at night, or I stay up all night. I exercise and take melatonin to no avail. I have racing thoughts at night. I'm just especially sad that my sleeping meds aren't working for me anymore :( I also have these dreams that last me a short while before I wake up again... I can't remember the last time I've slept that was 7 hours long. I just want to sleep normally again.
Signal	I sometimes wake up multiple times a night, sometimes wake up once and can't get back to sleep in the middle of the night, sometimes I can't even sleep for 36 hours or take hours to fall asleep. I rarely get a full night of sleep (8 uninterrupted hours) and even more rarely a good night of sleep.I am so tired all the time. It drives me insane. It has gotten to the point where I can barely focus at all.I have tried: medication, many doctors (including sleep specialists), meditation, therapy, hypnosis, music, sound mixing, videos, apps and more.I haven't tried yoga yet, so that's what would be next on my list. But I don't have high hopes.Do you also struggle with sleep ? Do you have anything to recommend me ?
NotSignal	Totally not looking for anyone to solve my problems. Just find those who can relate. I’m in what I call a spiral where I don’t sleep for weeks and start hallucinating. I have a professional job to hold down. Anyone relate? My husband can not understand at all and says he’s never heard of anything like this, which I’ve experienced many times
Signal	melatonins like not working for me anymore? i take 5 mg like every night now and it’s just doesn’t help me fall asleep better.
Signal	Hi, so I've been taking adhd meds (dextroamphetamine xr 10mg every morning) for a few months and antidepressants (escitaloprám 10mg every morning) for a week or so. i take 3mg of melatonin before going to sleep but i always fall asleep for 2-3 hours only and then wake up, stay awake for an hour or two and then fall asleep again. So i would like to take maybe 4.5mg of melatonin but im kinda scared it will "interfere" with my meds?Im sorry if it's not the right community but I have no idea where I should post this, and I'm sorry for how chaotic this message is.I hope someone can help me, thank you!
NotSignal	12:21am here. Just took an OTC sleep aid and waiting for it to start working - how's everyone else doing? I have anxiety about taking any kinda medicine, so I gotta occupy my mind somehow before the sleep aid works so - reddit it is.
NotSignal	I get enough sleep. 8-9 hours.I wake up feeling exhausted and it takes me about an hour to fall asleep. I have lots of racing thoughts. I usually wake up once or twice during the night. Could CBT-I help me? I understand that I'm getting enough sleep, but I'm still exhausted.Can it help me improve sleep Quality instead of just quantity?
Signal	Ever since quarantine, i have been getting around 6, sometimes even 7 hours of sleep every night which is crazy to me! Ever since i was 11 i have sleeping issues, however when i started secondary it progressively got worse and when i entered year 11 last year i was getting around 4 hours of broken sleep every night. This year, year 12 (i am 17) i have been getting 3 ish hours.So back to the story, ever since quarantine i have been SLEEPING, it feels like a miracle, however i have started having to wake up for driving lessons, lessons etc and have been having to set alarms.... and on those days i am not sleeping.Does anyone know what this is called?? I generally get anxious at night, but especially on these types of nights i get even more anxious and cant sleep. If you know what this is, do you also have some suggestions so i can sleep better when college starts up again?? 💗💗
Signal	Even though it’s quarantine and I can just sleep in I still don’t like waking up late for some reason. I have both melatonin and Benadryl but Idk if it’s too late to take either one now. And meditation/counting sheep/deep breathing literally does nothing to help me fall asleep. Suggestions what to do?
Signal	I was diagnosed about 6-7 months ago with OCD. it was a devastating diagnosis but i come to terms with it more and more every day.as a result, I stay up very late either feeling extreme guilt over something minor/nonsensical OR my brain is buzzing with thoughts I don’t want. the thing about it is, I can’t shut my ocd off, obviously, but it’s making it increasingly harder to sleep. I sleep at about 9-10 am and wake up around 3-4, often waking up once or twice during. so I sleep for a good while but I cannot for the life of me fall asleep at a reasonable time. it drives my boyfriend nuts cause he often doesn’t like to sleep while I’m having ocd spikes or anxiety attacks and doesn’t like to sleep until I’m calm but I cannot help it. I often stay up cleaning or watching videos to distract me from my scary thoughts. meditation is hard bc I CANNOT quiet my brain and I am basically never relaxed. I am constantly anxious, 24/7.I bought Advil pm recently but am afraid to take it bc my OCD tells me something bad will happen. Anyone here with OCD? What helps you sleep?
NotSignal	Hey guys , anyone else have this experience . You find something that you think helps your insomnia , such as exercise some type of tea . Whatever it is , and you have a day where you sleep good and see all the ways it benefits your mood and life in general so you keep doing the same thing . But in the end you just go back to not being able to sleep. It seems like whatever I do I'll always just not be able to sleep good :'/
Signal	So basically, even drinking caffeine now doesn't faze me, if I get my 25mg pill an hour before bed I become a zombie and go to sleep very fast.I hope to take the whole box (30 days) then not get another prescription no matter what, It will be summer and I will not have university responsibilities so I can try to combat it myself..But yeah I lost to my insomnia this far, taking pills is never the right way. I will fight it again in a month.
NotSignal	It’s 5:13 AM right now, and my mom wants me to drive to the bank early today to deposit some notes, and later buy some groceries. Has anyone driven without sleep before? How did you feel?
Signal	Recently i have been suffering more due to insomnia. I wakes up at 7/8am and cant even sleep until 6am. I've tried breathing technique taught by my counsellor and it doesn't help. One way that I can quickly fall asleep is taking med(issued by the doctor), but that means i will be knocked our for a full day the next day. And I'm running low on the med. Neither do i want to rely too much on meds. I suffered from insomnia most sundays when i was still a kid(not even kidding, pun not intended😂). I really envy my family members who fall asleep once their head touches the pillow.
NotSignal	i've been having a shit week so drank myself today, just to take the edge off before bed.I've noticed tho that everytime i drink, i tend to stay up late. I knew that before drinking and thought "maybe not this time and maybe it'll actually help"...and its 7am already 🤷🏽‍♂️
Signal	I (m, 34 yr) have always been a light sleeper. But at least until a few years ago I was able to fall asleep within an hour and usually get around 6-7 hours of sleep, albeit with waking up 10-20 times per night. I usually went to bed around 02:00 - 03:00 and then wake up at 09:00-10:00.But since I have a daughter, who usually wakes up at 06:00, that lifestyle is no longer possible. I now often have to wake up at 06:00, or at 09:00 when my wife gets up with her.She is now 2.5 years old, but my body won't adapt to this new time schedule. It's mainly because I actually never get sleepy. I never did, also not before my daughter was born. I have always been amazed with people who 'doze off' or almost do. Or people who have to 'fight against sleep'. My wife for instance can sleep anytime, anywhere. She sometimes takes a '20 min nap'. Sleeps after 30 seconds and wakes up after 20 min feeling refreshed. Haha that is so alien to me.I shoot weddings and in the season I sometimes shoot 14-16 hour wedding days. And then I usually have to drive back home for another hour. I feel exhausted after a day like that. Completely broken. But sleepy? Nope. It can still take a while before I fall asleep, even after a day like that and most likely wake up a lot and too early.Sometimes I am so tired, I try to take a nap when my daughter is doing too. But that usually doesn't work. It takes me at least an hour to sleep and usually I only have 1.5 hour. It just doesn't work. Again, I feel tired but not sleepy. My mind is active. My eyes are not 'heavy'. And the moment I lay down my body and mind are like 'let's go do something' . The only time I feel sleepy is after I just woke up in the middle of the night. I can then turn around, or pee, and then sleep within a minute or so again. Many of you probably have the same or even worse. I now sleep between 4-6 hours per night on average. Luckily, I sleep every night. It could be worse. But I am still not getting enough. And it's wearing me down. I cannot be the loving father and husband I want to be on tired days. Anxiety is making it's way back to my brittle brain and not to mention the physical damage I am doing to my body if this continues. Worrying about this makes it only worse, of course. When I go to bed now I can't help but constantly think 'if i dont fall asleep soon I will be tired again tomorrow'. Or 'shit, only 4 hours left again until 06:00'. So I think I have 2 problems: \- Physically, never getting sleepy. \- Psychologically, worrying about sleep and making it an issue. Which definitely makes everything worse.I have tried valerian but that doesn't really work. I am weary about sleep meds or melatonin because of dependency. That might make it even harder to sleep in the long run wouldn't it?So, what has helped for you. How to become sleepy? And how to break this damn cycle.
NotSignal	When medications fail... My insomnia has been hit or miss lately, my doc is throwing everything at it to see what works, my vision is becoming astigmatic and occasional blurry. Classes are online now too.. man, this year really sucksss. Good luck to you all, hopefully you can get some rest tonight and stay safe from this virus.
Signal	I have been seriously crumbling under insomnia. Please help. My joints pain, body ache and still I cannot sleep. I have tried Ambien .. but it works and makes me feel congested next day.Also, this all started after I stopped benzos and Ads which caused insomnia in the first place. But I am off 4 years and this is not getting any better.What should I do? Please advice the best options. I have tried all the things I can find on net...
NotSignal	I developed a weird fear of sleep I don't know why it all began 1 month ago when I woke up and couldn't fall asleep again I was obssessed by weird ideas like : "You're not going to sleep like you used to" "What does it feel like when everybody is sleeping and you're the only one awake" I can't get rid of these ideas also I become frustrated by the fact that we lose consciousness in our sleep it's like that my brain wakes me up whenever I feel I'm going to sleep because of that I only sleep 2 to 3 interrupted hours a day sometimes i don't sleep at all what can i do i want to fix that without medication how to stop being obssessed by these ideas ?I don't feel sleepy even if i don't sleep well.Lack of sleep really affected me both physically and mentally.
NotSignal	how’d i manage to get both tho can’t do fuckin eitheri’m so exhausted my body needs sleep :) but not enough to just sleep apparently
Signal	I am going to die I just know it it's been a week since I've had good rest I'm going to die
NotSignal	Im 20 years old, male, no underlying condition. Already had the cardiologist check me couple months ago and last year and both times, my heart came out good. This has never happened to me before. Today marks the day i went to sleep at 12 pm which is the higjest ive gone. Tried sleeping, tossing and turning but my body wasn’t tired which frustrated me, which then leads me to try to force myself to sleep and boom, here comes a fast heart beat with the pulse that i feel in my chest. Yesterday i slept better with about 8-9 hours and the day before 7 hours i believe. This whole anxiety (or insomnia idk what it is) is terrible man. I want to sleep like how i use to which was me getting tired around 3-5 am and i never worried about if i was going to sleep or not. Now it’s been a week and ever since i felt an irregular heart beat, i wasn’t really able to sleep as good as i use to. Is sleeing at 12 pm dangerous with only an hour or 2 of sleep ? I would like to know how people handle sleeping very very late
Signal	I've l been taking trazodone 50mg for a few days with lackluster results, so tonight I took 100mg. Instead drifting off into a nice slumber, the weird feeling of the my heavy limbs and dizziness triggered a panic attack and now I can't fucking fall asleep. Time for another sleepless night woo hoo. 😀
Signal	Hey everyone, Long time anxiety sufferer. Was always able to sleep a solid 8 hours, no matter what. This winter I had a **major** anxiety bout, worst of my life. After 2 or 3 weeks of that, one day I just didn't sleep at all. 0 hours. Laid awake all night. Freaked me out, was extremely worried about not sleeping. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, Day 2 0 hours of sleep. I tried Tylenol, I tried ZzZQuil, nothing. That morning I ended up in the ER dehydrated and with my blood pressure/heart rate through the roof. Blood tests, EKG, all normal. They gave me 1mg Ativan, and I was as happy as a clam. Discharged me with a handful 1mg Ativan pills and a referral to a psychiatrist. I took 1 mg for the first 3 nights and it just knocked me out like a light in 15 minutes. They read me the riot act about benzos, and I read here about rebound insomnia, so I stopped taking it. Without Ativan, I didn't sleep particularly soundly, but I slept. Split the remaining Ativan to .5mg, and used the remaining pills once or twice a week for a few weeks to get me to the psychiatrist.Psychiatrist said Ativan was not the best, switched it to Klonopin, and said if I can get anxiety under control I'd likely sleep fine again. As it turns out I'm pretty sensitive to benzos, so I've been using .125mg Klonopin during the day, and **usually** sleep okay at night. Been averaging maybe .25mg of Klonopin once or twice a week at night if I'm really struggling...but this really corresponds with high anxiety days. Where I'm kind of stuck right now I'm really weirded out about using benzos to sleep and manage anxiety. I tried Lexapro but that stuff **wrecked** me after 2 days, and the psychiatrist just recommended Klonopin and starting therapy again (I was doing therapy for 3 years prior, but I'm not sure how committed I was to making life changes) I realize using benzos twice-ish a week to sleep isn't a *terrible* place to be in, but I've been trying to avoid all things anxiety. That's proven impossible with COVID-19, and someone moving into the apartment above me which has me really freaked out about noise, being woken up, and not being able to sleep again. With all this being said, what do you folks who have been in the same position recommend? Has therapy, regular exercise, meditation etc. and all those good things proven beneficial to you?
NotSignal	I've been taking melatonin the last few months regularly and during my last checkup they noticed my blood CO2 levels were higher than normal. Just curious if anyone knows if taking melatonin at night can increase CO2 in the blood? Thanks.
Signal	I really wanna know why this happened. Months ago I went to the hospital with my mom (after months and months of begging) for my breathing troubles, so the doctor prescribed me a heartburn medicine. I took it, and at night I woke up with a desert dry throat and mouth, so dry I thought I was gonna suffocate. After that I got severe health anxiety, it almost felt like I had psychosis or something, I was convinced for some reason that I had cancer or something else. Everyday I would lay in bed and shiver like a leaf out of inexplicable fear. Most nights went sleepless and if I was lucky, I could catch one hour of sleep occasionally.Anyway, it has been 7 months from then on. I still have insomnia. I've tried Xanax, melatonin, and propranolol now. None of them produced any significant results. Everyday I feel severe anxiety.My parents, won't take me to the hospital. All those medications I've tried were off-the-counter, in my country. So my question is... could there be a physical cause behind all this? Any underlying condition, perhaps? I had my thyroid levels checked before and they were normal....
Signal	Been on trazodone off and on since December with varying degrees of success. When I first started i would take it right around my bedtime which is 10:00 since the container says to take at bedtime. It didn't really seem to have much effect. Lately I've been taking it 4 hours!! before bed (6 pm) along with melatonin which seems to help. Does that seem odd to anyone? Is it just a case of timing where it works better that way or is it all in my head? Most nights it puts me out but there has been the few times where I needed some extra help from zquil. 50 mg. Really sudden bout of insomnia. Nothing really traumatic / stressful happened to me between the last night I slept good and the following night. I guess except for the sleep trouble itself. Thanks for any input.
Signal	Does anyone use Xanax for sleep? I started taking it a few months ago for sleep related anxiety and it seems to be helping a little bit. Does anyone take lexapro as well and had any bad reactions?
Signal	The longest extreme bout of insomnia I've dealt with was about 120 hours of straight wakefulness. At that point I wasn't sure if I was psychotic or if my brain had turned to literal soup. I couldn't understand words and I felt like I was constantly seeing things in my peripheral vision. My train of thought was just an abstract field of shifting color from which I could discern no meaning. Wasn't doing drugs or anything, just dealing with some good, old-fashioned bipolar disorder rearing its ugly head in the form of what was (probably?) a mixed episode. For me this raised the question: at what point do you need to go to the hospital if you can't sleep? Where is the threshhold for causing potential bodily harm? I mean harm caused by nothing but lack of sleep itself. Lets say someone had no mental/physical health issues or substance use and dealt with idiopathic insomnia. What would health professionals even do for you if you went to the hospital for such a complaint?
Signal	I was diagnosed with IBS about a month ago and ever since I slowly started waking up every 2 or 3 hours. I typically go to sleep around 1 AM. I would wake up around 3:30 ish or 4 then again around 6 or 7. I have taken 3 mg melatonin but it hasn't helped much.Just recently I have trouble even falling asleep and even if I do, I wake up every 1 or 2 hours. I can fall back asleep most of the time but sometimes I can't. Several days ago I wasn't able to sleep at all for the first time ever. IBS is known to be a malfunctioning of the gut and brain. Can stress cause inflammation in the brain that it would keep me awake? My therapist thinks its stress and that i just have to relax. I do admit that I have been stressed and panic-googling about how I can resolve IBS. While my pain and bathroom habits have been under control for the most part, my sleep has gotten way worse.I think its more than stress tbh. I have read poor gut conditions like IBS causes more alertness in the brain. Does anyone have any thoughts on what could be causing awakening every few hours? Thanks.
Signal	Stupid insomnia! O am tired but can't apeep...and I have mqxed out my sleep meds so frustrated.
Signal	I've had sleeping problems since I was 6. It got worse in high school. I either wouldn't be able to sleep except maybe 3 hours for weeks or I would sleep 18+ hours when I wasn't in school or work. There was really no in between. My mind wouldn't shut off and think of the most horrible or annoying things. Or it would and I would pass out on my bedroom floor or bed. Tried talking to doctors and family frequently about it but I kept getting ignored or said I was lying. Well it got better once I moved in with my gf. I could go to bed before 5/9 am and didnt sleep as much during the time my brain shut off. I think this might be a stress problem since recently its started again. Going to bed at 5am or sleeping till 4pm+. Its put me into such a bad mood and I dont want to accidentally lash out at my gf. We've tried several sleeping meds and other common tips like sleep music. The meds dont work but the music helps keep my brain a bit more calm. I cant currently go to the doctor's because of the virus but does anyone have any advice or tips to help manage this till I can? :,)
NotSignal	I’m so tired of the cycle of waking up when I’m about to sleep because of my heart pounding so fast or a hypnic jerk then heart pounding. It took me 2-3 hours every night before I actually have a deep sleep and wake up in the morning feeling tired. Really hope this will end soon.
NotSignal	I haven't slept three night in a row now. I'm glad there's a community of people going through similar things.
Signal	I developed after a few nights of total sleeplessness a fear that I am unable to sleep. Since then I stay in bed for long hours 10, and I see some dreams. After the dreams I always wake up and then for undetermined periods I stay awake and shift around in bed and then repeat. I have no idea if I slept 2 hours or 7 hours.
NotSignal	I also have not been able to sleep until 5am when the sun is rising. This started about 5 weeks ago while in lock-down end of may. It as nothing to do with work as my life as not changed much since lock-down since I am a modern day monk even tho looking at me you would not guess, living along side the every day population. After seeing all the posts, nobody as mentioned the water we drink, cook and shower in. Since lock-down, fluoride in the water as risen a lot. My osmosis water filter as gone dark brown in lock-down, my shower tiles keep getting brown sludge on them, watering my garden with tap water in as killed some of my garden plants . Peoples brains are becoming more stupid all due to forced man made fluoride intake.I believe, or should say, I know we are being poisoned by the water just like the jews were fed fluoride in the nazi camps in ww2 to dull their brains and keep them quiet and docile while locked up. I'm sure this is happening all over the world while we are all in lock-down. Those in power are all working together around the world to control us and keep us in check and have full control over us.People are reporting the tap water tasting different since lock-down, and the water suppliers and main-media outlets scientists and governors and those in control are giving out excuses to cover it up. There are more health problems in people since lock-down. Depression, sleep patterns, liver, kidneys, feet and legs, eyes, ear noises and pains, muscle pains, bones and joints immune system problems, cold hands and feet, cancers, strokes etc... created by those in power and making big money off us by the way of drugs and medical equipment all for the sake of greed. I do not eat meat no more, or sugar and I've just cut out salt and I try to keep away from processed foods much as possible these last few years. I try to keep away from wheat,. no butters or fats, I do no drink wine or beer. I eat only twice a day. My diet is very, very strict and I try to eat as natural as possible . I recently believe after doing lots of online research man made fluoride is the real cause of most of my health problems over the 50 odd years since I have been on mother earth in this divine body. At the moment I am giving borax (boron) water method ago to see if it removes the man made fluoride from my body. Iodine thins my blood too much, so that;s on hold. Detox is not fun.Fluoride is hard to remove from the body, I am having feet and leg twitches mostly at night these last weeks. I have also noticed dark patches all over and under my feet and around ankles. I believe this is fluoride buildup which is causing my bad twitching legs and feet recently. It could be covid virus symptoms, but I do not think it is. I have kept away from tap water for the last 12 days and still got these health and sleep problems. I have recently started drinking, cooking and washing in well/ground water that I collect, but I think its going to take months before I see any improvements in my body, as I have been showering in tap water for years, and I have read the body can absorb up to a pint of shower water in one shower session as the skin pores open up when warm.I sometimes wondered maybe the sleep patterns are due to cosmic waves being so many comets about at the moment and are pulling and pushing mother earth about as they come in and pass through or close to our solar system, just like the moon as a big effect on earth. Or maybe the massive comet Kali the destroyer from the constellation hyades is closing in and affecting life, as her cycle is 104 years and she is due in 2022.I really think people need to wake up and think for them self's instead of listening to doctors, scientists, people in power and those who are and want to make money from ill and suffering people and animals. These cruel lying people will pay in the end, for life lives on both sides of death, for life is eternal! The life's you look after are your passed lives, and the life's you take and treat badly are your future life's, for there is only one divine spirit and you are the divine spirit.Everything that we do in life is recorded within us from birth till death. Everything! So there's no escape for the evil greedy wicked no matter what they may think. We all will be judged in death and reborn in either a lower or higher realm depending on ones deeds of the past life, for that is the divine law. Life is a test, and is not to abuse and take what we want, but to shepherd and treat life with respect, for like I say, there is only one divine and we are it, and every life form being in a different atomic fraction of time realm, for we do not all live on the exact same time line, but every animated life form lives in a different time line to one another creating what we believe to be multiple spirits on earth, when in fact there is only truly one divine spirit, all created to escape eternal loneliness of the single eternal consciousness.Start taking control of your own life's, and stop listening to those lying greedy pieces of shit that rule over you. Read some ancient online texts like the kolbrin bible, the veda's , the Bhagavad-gita, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, book of enoch or the essene gospel of piece book 1 and awaken the mind and learn the secrets to life like I have the past 10 years, for our history is not what we are told and taught in this end of age, and chuck that dirty perverted mind controlling dumb minding bull-shitting television in the skip. The only things you will learn and gain from these goons in power of today's world is pain, suffering, slow murder, sadness, and slavery of your divine holy temple until you reach death door All for the sake of those pigs in power so they can destroy, kill and do what they please with OUR mother earth. They are just evil bastards pretending to help us, when really we don't need them, for the ancient books gives us the knowledge we truly need to live a better life.Seek and ye shall find.Written after only fours hours sleep and not looking forward to bedtime again!
Signal	I'm having issues with insomnia after coming off antidepressant. My psychiatrist prescribed me of 25mg seroquel to help but it just made things worse. What should I do know? Visit a different kind of doctor? Like who?
Signal	My girlfriend is coming off 300 mg of Quetiapine that she took for bipolar. She was on for a month or so and now that shes off she cant sleep. Its been 3 nights. She gets anxious about two hours into sleep and just wakes up. Does anyone have any tips?
NotSignal	How do you guys stop over thinking? Usually I’ll play solitaire right before sleep and it relaxes me enough to fall asleep but 1-2 times a week I’ll Start thinking about something and can’t stop, my brain refuses to shut off and I’ll lay there for 3-4 hours trying to not think. It’s so frustrating. Does anyone have any tricks?Sometimes nature music helps, sometimes it doesn’t.
NotSignal	For about maybe 1 or 2 years now I haven't been able to sleep without my headphones in because I cant fall asleep easy I usually listen to YouTube videos on low volume.It's like my head won't stay quiet. When I do fall asleep without my head phones I get nightmares but not like a scary dream just super realistic and when I wake up it's very confusing because it feel like it really happened.But on another note sometimes I can fall asleep without my headphones and I wont dream anything I'm not sure why my brain does it
NotSignal	I don’t like this not one bit. I’m starting to feel productive all of a sudden uhh maybe I’ll do something. I wanna smoke but that does not help my anxiety what do i doooo
NotSignal	Are there any supplements or medication I can take to help sleep I constantly will not be able to sleep with no matter what I do until around 4-6 maybe even later and wake up 2-4 hours later.Sometimes i’ll get really bad night sweats or my vision will be blurry when i’m trying to get to sleep but it’ll be normal in the morning. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated and like what they actually are cause I have no knowledge and I just want to sleep earlier and know I’ll get a good sleep. Any reply is greatly appreciated. :)
Signal	A little background on my medications and such I do to help:For medications and such I usually take around 80mg to upwards of 130mg of melatonin, probably placebo at this point in my journey for sleep with melatonin but I still take it. I also have been taking between 50-120mg of benadryl which works so much better than melatonin, but the doc recommends I stop taking this, which I have tried. I also have been experimenting with p5p and other nootropics. I have recently been looking into other sleep meds like z-class and benzo (which i have taken before for panic attacks, worked way better for sleep but.. addiction.. so I try to avoid). (also tried trazadone, its not good..)As for other things I try to do to fall asleep, podcasts, can be very relaxing but gives me something to focus on so not everynight. Also meditation and relaxation techniques / avoid screens / exercise (early in the day)Nothing has really worked and I constantly get under 4hrs of a sleep a night (Also waking up during this time) If you guys have any tips to share or medication to ask the doc about please let me know! I am a new comer here and hope you guys can all get the sleep we all need :)
Signal	I'm starting to think anxiety is also a major cause of my sleep issues and am thinking of starting medication. Has anyone tried and had any luck?
Signal	I took 5mg of Melatonin at about 9:30 EST. I’m still awake. Thinking about taking ZzzQuil now. Is it too soon?
Signal	My sleep has never really been great, however over the last 4 or so weeks it has gotten significantly worse. I would usually get at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep, however recently I would be lucky to even get 5 and I would wake up multiple times throughout the night and struggle to fall back asleep. A week or so ago I tried taking zopiclone to atleast get one night of good sleep but it literally did nothing even though previously it was extremely effective.
Signal	I have a really bad quality of sleep. I'm used to getting 2-4 hours of sleep a night (6 if I'm lucky) and then feel sleepy during the day.A few days ago, I was rolling on my bed at 3 am trying to fall asleep, as usual. After a few attempts of counting sheep, I remember doing this strange thing with my eyelids; I pretended that there was something heavy pulling down my lids and I had to make a little effort to keep them open. Or maybe imagine you're drunk and are about to pass out, and are trying not to, but your efforts of not passing out are useless (idk, this is hard to explain xd).Before trying to apply this technique (i'll call it "the drunk man technique", lol), be sure that you're relaxed beforehand. I get relaxed by counting to 100 in a foreign language, for example (btw, english is not my native language so correct me if there are any typos).Then, after applying the technique, you will probably feel sleepy, making it easier to fall asleep.This works for me, let me know if it also works for you in the replies :)
Signal	I started taking lunesta a couple of weeks ago. The first time the morning after I threw up. I didn’t connect The two though and took it again about a week later. I had the same symptoms the next day but EXTREMELY violent vomiting and diarrhea All night long. Has anyone else had these symptoms? Might I be allergic? Is there any other good sleep aids I should try instead?
NotSignal	Every time before I go to bed I will be very stress out thinking about the past and future which gives me anxiety,stress and depression all at once.i don't how i can face it.pls help
Signal	Sorry this is going to be long😬 Short story : Started to have insomnia in February due to my overreacting self who thought that after one sleepless night with no real reason, I had lost my ability to sleep. This event caused me to develop sleep anxiety as well as pretty bad insomnia. (Oh god I wish I could go back in time and not overreact over this) I have sleep onset and maintenance problems. Those are all caused by anxiety over sleep. At first I used Zopiclone and it worked pretty well, but my body got tolerant to it. I was also taking supplements like Valerian, Melatonin & 5HTP. None of them really worked but I was taking them anyway. A month ago I stopped everything. I was to a point where I slept 0 to 2 hours per night. I felt dizzy, drunk and I had a constant headache. I decided to stop everything and I didn’t really stressed about sleep because I knew what kind of night I was going to have. 2 weeks ago I slept decently(4-6 hours a night), at least much more than the kind of sleep I had a few weeks before. I realise that I slept more because I was not anxious. BUT a few days ago everything collapsed again. because of one bad night where I was anxious, I am back to sleeping 1-3 night and i’m not sleeping before 5:30 am. I realise that I have to get a hold on my anxiety, but since I don’t want to go back on meds, would a program such as CBT-i or ACT (already tried by myself but failed to pursue) administered by a sleep specialist would help me to get a grip on my sleep anxiety and also beat insomnia for good? Or should I get a therapist instead?
Signal	I had **sleep maintenance insomnia** **for over 5 months** with brief remission in between for a 4-5 days. During this period **my sleep averaged about 3 hours a day**. Along with insomnia, I had:\- chronic pain in the lower back (sciatia)\- tingling in the extremities\- irregular heart rate \- muscle twitches all over my body perhaps due to the lack of sleep\- Vitamin B and D deficiency (but correcting these two with supplements did not immediately improve my sleep issues)\- nocturnal emission (which would wake me up)Here’s how I managed it and can possibly claim that I have got over it now. I am now sleeping 6 to 7 hours a day with the other symptoms having reduced significantly. I did not do anything wildly expensive or time-consuming. I am a lawyer who has to work a minimum of 10 hours a day and very often, longer. After the frustration of trying various individual strategies piecemeal and none of them working effectively, I devised a comprehensive strategy targeting all etiological factors simultaneously. This worked and the improvement was visible over a period of 3-4 days.I just want to help others going through this. Of course, not as a substitute for professional medical advice if someone needs it. I divided the possible causal factors into the following:**A. PHYSICAL: chronic pain, apnea****B. EMOTIONAL: depression, anxiety, negativity****C. COGNITIVE: stress, feeling tired-but-wired, inability to concentrate****D. NUTRITIONAL: deficiency in vitamin B12, D3 or C, magnesium or iron**I addressed all these families of issues by using the techniques below. Although I still don’t know what specifically did the trick, I feel it became impossible for my insomnia to persist after I implemented these strategies in combination.**PHYSICAL**1. **Sleeping on the left side** instead of on the back or on the right side (see ‘What is the best sleeping position?’ by St. John - Clark Pain Treatment Center on youtube) – this helped eliminate the pattern of me waking up in the dead of the night with a dry mouth and palpitations and finding it impossible to sleep2. **Ventilating bedroom for an hour before sleeping and cooling the room with an ac** if required for a few minutes before sleeping (ensured that I could breathe well through the night and the room remained cool enough to not militate against sleep)3. **Used a memory-foam mattress for sleeping on my side with a thick pillow** (no torque on the hip-flexors, no stress on neck and shoulders) and **a firm cotton mattress on the floor for sleeping on the back** but mostly avoided sleeping on the back4. **Exercises targeting sciatia/chronic pain** – in the morning and in the evening for 15 min each (exercises for lower back and core strengthening (Bob & Brad - 'Abdominal exercises that don't hurt your back' and Joanna Soh Official - 'Ab exercises that won't hurt your lower back': both on youtube)5. **Weekend hikes**6. **Jogging or simple calisthenics in the late evening** at least 4 hours before bed time7. **Getting direct sunlight exposure for a minimum of 30 min** as early in the day as possible8. **Pranayama** in the morning to improve breathing (ujjayi breathing, anulom-vilom, bhastrika, kapalbhati) (Sri M’s channel – available on youtube) 9. **Avoiding naps** between final morning awakening and bedtime like the plague10. **Regular dinner and sleep schedule** to reinforce circadian rhythm (gave myself 7 hours in bed till I hit 6 hours of sleep and now 8 hours)11. **Using a little bit of cannabis** 2 hours before bed time on some days (no more than 2-3 drags)12. **Avoiding screen and blue light for an hour** before bed (melatonin-antagonist)13. **Avoiding sex too close to bed-time** but having it earlier in the dayYoga nidra and sleep hypnosis help relax the body and focus the mind and help take the mind off the awful thoughts and anxiety about insomnia. They are restorative and a good substitute for power naps, which are counterproductive to insomniacs. But I only recommend doing them during a middle of the night awakening or upon final awakening. Doing it in the afternoon can deprive you of sleep drive and doing it too close to bed-time at night may lead to sleep apnea because you have to do them while lying on your back (and this is a bad sleep posture for most people including me) and sometimes the tongue relaxes so much that it falls to the back of the mouth blocking the respiratory passage. **EMOTIONAL**1. **Meditation** (ana-pana, vipassana)2. **Practising expressing gratitude** for the creative and positive aspects of life – in a pre-sleep journal and in meditation3. **Talking to friends who I really love and also family** after work4. In general, taking the time to **help people** in need in whatever small ways possible and **not being hard on anyone**These practices really help reducing stress, bringing down elevated levels of adrenaline and cortisol which cause hyper-arousal that often triggers maintenance insomnia.**COGNITIVE**1. **Yoga nidra** (Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati: beginner or intermediate scripts available on youtube) or **sleep hypnosis** (Michael Sealey or Jason Stephensen scripts available on youtube) – once a day - immediately on waking up after sleep 2. **Optic flow** (lateral eye movement – moving your eyes horizontally like during a drive – rather than vertically like when scrolling on the phone)3. **Looking at the horizon** in a park or from a roof (this is supposed to have a calming effect as opposed to staring at things close by)4. **Focusing at work** and avoiding a general distracted state of mind which is usually a by-product of insomnia. Using the Pomodoro technique with work helped me.5. **Practising an instrument regularly** (I play the flute but this could be involving oneself in any other form of art or cooking/baking)6. **Reading books written in an emotionally rich style but are not action-packed** (e.g., In Search of Lost Time by Proust) or listening to a well-narrated audiobook in bed as a precursor to sleep (If reading a book, I strongly recommend using a physical book with a reading light rather than an electronic device. If listening to an audiobook, I suggest using in-ear buds that are comfortable and do not restrict sleeping posture – in any case, take them off when you realise that you’re feeling sleepy and don’t have them on after sleep onset)Yoga nidra and sleep hypnosis help relax the body and focus the mind and help take the mind off the awful whirling thought patterns and mild-to-acute anxiety about insomnia. They are a good substitute for the restorative effects of power naps, which are counterproductive to insomniacs. But I only recommend doing them during a middle of the night awakening or upon final awakening. Doing it in the afternoon can deprive you of sleep drive and doing it too close to bed time at night may lead to sleep apnea because you have to do them while lying on your back (and this is a bad sleep posture for most people) and sometimes the tongue relaxes so much that it falls to the back of the mouth blocking the respiratory passage. I learned about a. to c. above from Dr. Andrew Huberman – who has done many talks on the neuroscience of sleep and relaxation. **NUTRITIONAL**1. **Vitamin B supplement** (Jocare-OD) – 3 months on physician’s advice2. **Vitamin D supplement** (60000 units/week) – 3 months on physician’s advice3. **Vitamin C** – gooseberry juice, or ginger lemon honey (Vitamin C not only helps boost immunity which might wane from insomnia but also has a direct connection with better sleep)4. **Avocados** (has omega-3, Vitamin C, magnesium and other great stuff for sleep)5. **Bananas** – used during middle-of-the-night awakening along with milk6. **Natural Magnesium mix** (made a natural supplement with powdered almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds and poppy seeds – I had this with milk and chocolate powder once a day)7. **Turmeric milk** (curcumin is known to help with the build-up of beta-amyloid plaque resulting from poor sleep)8. **Fish oil** supplements (for the same reason as above - I am a lacto-ovo-vegetarian otherwise)9. **Amaranth and eggplant** 3-4 times a week (for iron)10. **Aswagandha** an hour before sleep (helps ease stress)11. **Curd before sleeping** (cools gut and aids digestion)12. **Magnesium L-threonate and L-theanine** (had these as back-ups in case nothing else worked but did not have to use them; they cross the blood-brain barrier and since they are foods high up the synthesis chain - do not serotonin and dopamine imbalance)I was prescribed a 5-day course of benzos by my neuro to break the spell of insomnia. I had one pill on one night and got knocked out for 7 hours straight that night. Next day I was back to getting no more than 3 hours of sleep. I realised that benzos lead to sedation and not sleep. After that, I decided not to use benzos, melatonin pills, SSRIs or other anti-depressants unless everything else failed for a period of 1 month. I also tried some CBT-I techniques. The ones other than sleep restriction didn't work great. Sleep restriction was too dangerous to implement because of my work schedule. I made a sleep log which contained a checklist of the items listed above and also the following 4 parameters: *1. Total time spent in bed* *2. Total time spent asleep* *3. Sleep quality* *4. Factors that may have caused improvement/aggravation*. Every morning my girlfriend filled out the sleep log and checklist for me for the previous day. And within a week, my sleep quality skyrocketed. Again, that's me and it might not work for everyone. But I feel if implemented comprehensively it should many. I am open to talking to anyone else going through this issue since I have deep empathy for those who suffer from insomnia and would like to help in every way I can.
Signal	Typing this whilst shaking fighting off the next attackIts almost 630am. I have tried to sleep since maybe 4:30 to no avail. I did however have minor dream like hallucinations where i have been prodded and each time i was prodded i woke up. These last for about 2 minutes each time. So i technically had about 30 of these.An example is my eyelids. I couldnt tell of they were shut or not so i tried opening them. One eye saw my body get up. the other was me being in bed.I know this sounds nuts. Ive only been awake for like... 18 hours. No illicit drugs just the usual regiment. Im scared. I was having a great week of sleep and now its like my brain is fizzling out.Just a few minutes ago i was on my back just looking in front of me and my breathing slowed and i didnt even close my eyes and bam im on the floor in my room. As i said this is completely new to me. Idk if its mini sleeps but its super annoying and its stressing me out bad. My resting heart rate at the moment is 118. Im sweating and exhausted. I just want to sleep.
Signal	When I was in high school my parents put me on sleeping medication- to be honest I have no idea why I was even on them. I wasn’t an insomniac. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and I remember just being fed this medication “to help me sleep” ..... I didn’t need help sleeping at the time but my parents and psychiatrist INSISTED. The medication I was on was so strong that I remember it literally feeling paralyzing. When I was re-evaluated later on and it was discovered that I never had bipolar I was taken off of those medications.To this fucking day. I cannot sleep right. It’s been YEARS and quite frankly I’m scared to go back on them. They ruined my life. The only thing that helps me sleep is smoking weed (which is starting to not work for me anymore) or taking a few Benadryl’s (which is starting to not work) I was also given muscle relaxers for some pain I was having and that helped...... for a day or two. Honestly my only chance of sleeping for 8 hours would be to drink myself to sleep. A GOOD night consists of me going bed around 9pm...... fall asleep 11pm. And then wake up around 12am. Wide awake. Falling back asleep around 2am just to wake up again at 4am. Wide awake. If I’m lucky I’ll fall back asleep till around 6am and if I’m REALLY lucky I’ll sleep from about 6:45-8am. But then I feel like I was hit by a train. And that’s a GOOD NIGHT. It’s absolutely ridiculous and I cannot do this anymore. I have tried so many things - like all the generic things you find on google like “no blue light” or “no tv” I’ve tried medication sounds, sound machines, even warm milk (ew) I’m sick of this and honestly about to cave and just go back on the medications that brought me here in the first place.
Signal	I’ve been suffering from insomnia the last 2 years. I started smoking weed and it helped me, but for a couple months now, I don’t feel the effect as much.I only get deep sleep with Nyquil or sleeping drugs but I don’t want to rely on them. Did anyone else try weed and did it help you or not really? I’ve been feeling anxious as well, which keeps me up at night. Thank you for the help.
Signal	I’ve take 84mg of Melatonin and 5 NyQuil’s over the past 2 hours, why can’t I sleep. I’ve got the Flu and just want to get better by sleeping but I can’t fucking sleep. It’s 3:37AM now and I’ve been staring at the ceiling it guess what, I can’t fall asleep! God fuck this I hate this shit I just want to fucking get to sleep but for whatever god forsaken reason, I can’t.
NotSignal	I notice some nights I tend to sleep better than others. Tonight I keep falling asleep and waking up 15 min later. Usually happens when I drink coffee from what I’ve noticed although not always. One time I drank a drink with caffeine around 10 PM and was unable to sleep until 5 AM. Really sucked. Anyone else have a similar experiences?
NotSignal	I’ve been losing weight because I thought exhausting myself running miles would make my body sleep at night. Well it didn’t really work. And I lost 10 pounds (156p now 146p) heard some people lose or gain weight and was wondering if anyone else is going through that. Probably make me feel less alone if I knew it was normal due to lack of deep sleep.
NotSignal	Hi,I'm a University student doing research into sleep issues, at the moment I'm designing the bed.The issues I have looked at so far is personalising the experience of sleeping in the bed with size and height changing allowing the user to sleep in a bed that is there choice depending on their mood.I'm also looking at stopping phone usage in beds before sleep and the effects of EMF on sleep.What do you think would be some good additions to this bed and do you have any sites I could visit or research you think would aid the design of the bed or give me some additional features.Message me if you want to be kept up to date with the design!!Happy to hear from all!
Signal	Almost no sleep was up till 4 am until I finally fell asleep worried bc I have work tomorrow so idk if I should take it tonight or what
NotSignal	I have pretty bad sleep hygiene, which definitely contributes to my insomnia, so I know that’s something I need to work on. But does anyone else ever feel like sometimes their body and mind are both feeling tired and ready for sleep but then as soon as they are actually ready for bed the anxiety about not being able to fall asleep actually keeps them from sleeping?For example: I usually watch Netflix in bed with the lights on but dimmed before I start my sleep routine (which I’m supposed to begin an hour before my bedtime). Many times I’ll find myself start to doze off while watching and will have to force myself to start my routine (which involves journaling and reading) because I’m already feeling so tired both in mind and body. Then, after I complete my routine and turn off the lights and get in bed, my mind will feel so awake with stress about how much sleep I’ll get that night that I’ll just lie there tossing and turning for hours. The same thing happens in other instances, like if I’m a passenger in a car on my way home and fall asleep in the car but then can’t fall asleep once I get home. Does anyone else experience this and, if so, what do you do about it? I’ve thought it might be helpful to try to trick my body into falling asleep by purposefully doing something that isn’t supposed to signal sleep to prevent myself from getting anxious, but I’m worried that will just worsen my sleep hygiene in the long run.
NotSignal	The first one isnt a full on specialist, but works with teens and young adults with insomnia. I have failed all but one med.The second focused on sleep hygiene. I take it very seriously now and keep in that routine. I still dont sleep.I see one tomorrow that is hopefully going to give me some answers on why I cant sleep and what we can do
Signal	I am a 26yr old female and I have been taking Trazodone every night for 6yrs, typically 100-150mg but I’m technically prescribed 200mg. I have been wanting to get off it for years and every time I do, I have horrible insomnia, mood shifts (lots of crying, a little back and forth mania). I originally started taking it years ago when I had an eating disorder, which caused sleeping issues. I do not believe I have “actual” insomnia or depression, but my body is so dependent on it at this point. I stopped taking it 8 days ago, which is the longest I’ve made it. The most sleep I’ve gotten is 3hrs a night and even that is heavily disrupted and I wake up every hour. Does anyone have any advice for transitioning off it??
Signal	So this has been happening for about 4-5 days now. I noticed a few days ago that I was having trouble staying asleep, id wake up every 2-3 hours. Now, for the last few days, I haven’t been able to sleep well. I get maybe 2-3 hours, and as soon as I wake up, I feel like I haven’t been sleeping at all, it seems like I just opened my eyes and I’m not sleepy but I feel sleepy, if that makes sense. It’s making me extremely anxious and depressed, I don’t know what to do. I was already feeling anxious because I am going through something pretty traumatic right now, but the lack of sleep is making me insane. I can’t really think clearly right now I’m so stressed and anxious and I just want to cry but I’m having a hard time crying too. I have a constant headache, it feels like it’s on the top of my head and behind my eyes. My cheeks sometimes feel a bit weird and heavy. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I’m scared. And I’m thinking maybe my traumatic experience isn’t even that bad, I feel like it’s not that bad enough to bother me like this, but I don’t know. It’s happened a few weeks ago. I felt okay initially, cried some and felt okay I don’t know. I just can’t sleep now and I’m worried. I started to have slight twitching earlier today, and it comes and goes.
NotSignal	Short story: I'm exercising a lot, doing yoga, climbing, fighting. I had no problems with my sleep patterns before till two weeks ago. I've started waking up during the night after 2-3 hours of sleep and I'm being unable to fall back to dream Land. I need to mention that after I'm waking up my head and some parts of my body are feeling really tense. I'm trying now guided meditation and just overall wellness to see if that will do something. Have you ever been in this kind of situation before? Thank you!
Signal	in the mornings/throughout the day I'm always tired, yet the minute I try to fall asleep, I just... can't. I haven't fallen asleep before 1:00 AM for the past week and a half. I don't know what to do and it's really concerning me because this hasn't happened on a regular basis before. I never feel rested/refreshed after sleeping and I constantly wake up at night. If anyone has advice on how to get proper sleep so I can stop driving myself insane, I'd really appreciate it.
Signal	4 nights in a row. The only solution has been benadryl. 1st 3 nights half a dose (1 pill) but I had to increase to a full dose last night. I dont want to medicate for sleep tonight. What can I do?
Signal	I sometimes take antihistamines when I can't sleep, but I have a meeting with an allergist next Friday and can't take any antihistamines for the next week. Is Melatonin an antihistamine? Or Zzquil for that matter?
NotSignal	I can't fall asleep no matter how hard I try.. I am from a large family and my mom is sick... My family members think I am not concerned for her because I sleep during the day.
NotSignal	I know the title is really unspecific but am I the only one that enjoys laying in my bed with my eyes closed for long periods of time even without sleeping? I know I don't sleep and I'm fully aware of my surroundings but just the act of essentially pretending to be asleep is refreshing sometimes after a long day. It's only during the day when I'm exhausted to the point of being un functional but getting out of bed afterwards is somehow refreshing and energizing without sleeping. Am I the only one to experience this?
Signal	18M. I’m tired of this being an every night thing. If anyone wants to chat message me. I’m bored and probably not sleeping tonight.
NotSignal	Throughout my life, I have had a consistent sleeping time until I was around 9. Then I would sleep at a normal time (9:30 pm for me) and always wake up at around 2 am. I always feel well-rested though. Sometimes I do this for weeks at a time without sleeping from 2-7 am except when sick. I don't really feel tired though. Is this a good or bad thing?
Signal	First time post. I just recently went through a breakup that has me feeling insufficient and alone. Negativity, plus a sleep aid that has me up at 3:30. I’m interested to hear what you all use as a distraction technique for your mind so that you can make your eyes heavy again. Is it breathing? Changing your sleep location? Getting on your phone? Sleep well my fellow redditors. Good sleep shows up eventually.
NotSignal	I haven't seen a post in hours. Every one in my house is asleep and looks like on here as well. Like always, I'm the last one asleep...
Signal	Hi everyone, What have your experiences been like with doxylamine and benadryl? I’ve only taken benadryl but notice the tolerance builds up very quickly. Stops working after the second day. I’m interested to see if I should try doxylamine or just stick to benadryl, so if anyone has taken either one of these meds, please let me know your experiences!!
Signal	It’s now 8:31 in the morning. I had no urge to sleep so I didn’t. My sleep schedule is in the trash at this point. I used to be able to take 25 mg doxylamine succinate which made me sleep in like minutes, but I guess I’m immune to it now or something cause now all it does is make me slightly tired about 2-3 hours after I take it, then make me feel awful in the morning. I’m probably going to fall asleep then wake up at 4:00 pm. Literal definition of a viscous cycle. Advice, I guess? I really miss waking up to sunrises, not having it torment me.
Signal	I’m trying to break out of the habit of staying up late. Every night I’ll try to fall asleep a little bit earlier than usual. Recently my body as started to think that, despite being exhausted, it’s actually a very good idea to wake me up an hour after trying to fall asleep. It only started happening once I started drinking a little bit of alcohol, so I cut that out entirely. Also started reading an hour before bedtime instead of on my phone. Picked up meditating too. Ultimately I would really fucking like to get my sleeping schedule back on track. I’m done with staying up until 3 in the morning, but my body is apparently still not.Seriously. This is a pain. What is it that keeps me from just falling and staying asleep it doesn’t happen every night, but when it does, it just makes me angry. I’m really trying to do healthier things for myself. Yet sometimes I just get caught in this cycle of TRYING to fall asleep. I’ll try harder and harder and my body is just like “nope.” Next thing I know I wake up and it’s 3 in the morning again. I’m also pretty moody and anxious when this happens. Then I’ll wake up in the morning with fatigue, as per goddamn usual. “Go to sleep earlier if you feel fatigued.” I am TRYING. I would really enjoy 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Seriously. I’m laying here just feeling annoyed. Fatigued yet not sleepy. I WANT sleep but apparently I can’t have it. I just have this frustration that I can’t even direct towards anything right now. I just don’t know want I’m supposed to do about it.
NotSignal	Hey guys, I need some help. Taking a normal dosage of Zzzquil is not working for me anymore. I took a normal dosage ( 2 LiquiCaps) before I went to sleep around 1:30am, but the last time check I did was 4:00am. Awake for 3 and 1/2 hours just staring at the ceiling and not being able to sleep really pissed me off. So, asleep around 4am, then I woke up to use the bathroom at 7am ish, then again, could'nt sleep again until about 10am. Honestly I've tried everything, Melatonin gummies, Zzzquil capsules, but it just won't put me to sleep. Can anyone help me out here!? Like do I need to start taking more capsules than recommended just to get a good nights sleep?!
NotSignal	Been having moderate sleep problems lately and these people are not making things better. Geez. It’s not Fourth of July, it’s not a holiday yet. So why have you been shooting fireworks for several hours?? Everytime I lay down and try to lock in, thinking it’s been 10 min and they have to be done, their crazy loud fireworks go off. Sigh. Guess tonight I’m getting little sleep again.
Signal	For as long as I can remember, I’ve never been able to sleep, and if I could it’s been damn near impossible for me to stay asleep.I moved to a new state not to long ago, my boyfriend traveled for a living until he met me, and since then we have moved about 600 miles from my home town.The only reason for bringing that up is that we live with one another, he can fall asleep anywhere, and I do mean anywhere, and I cannot. He snores much louder than I have ever heard in my life. Now that we’ve settled in we also have a dog, and she sleeps in the bed with us every night.I usually sleep from 11-2 and from 3-5, always broken, then wake up and work 10 hour shifts four days a week. I work a job where I lift heavy objects and I’m constantly moving so I’m never really tired during the day, but sometimes I’ll stay up at night and obsess over sleeping when I know I should simply be sleeping, it’s never been that easy thoughAt the age of 16 I was put on Ativan to “help me sleep”, it didn’t do a whole lot of that just made me feel kind of funnyTonight I’ve tried a few go to options and they just aren’t working.I’ve also got ptsd and have nightmares often, I try weed to help put me to sleep and keep from having bad dreams but nothing seems to be working tonight My eyes are watery, but my hands feel dry, my body is warm but my legs are hot and my arms are coldMaybe I should try the couchOr maybe I should go and watch a tv show But trying to sleep isn’t happening right now
Signal	I get really bad paranoia at night. Essentially I can't sleep or leave my bedroom until the sun has come up. it's driving me crazy, but hopefully I'll be able to sleep once the sun rises.is it just me that has this issue? it's unpredictable when it decides to kick in. it hits me like a train and comes out of nowhere. I'm tired of dealing with this. it physically and mentally hurts and meds don't work. neither do those dumb steps of "have a place just for sleep" and "don't use technology before bed". they are unreasonable for most people and don't work most of the time.I'm just so exhausted, but I'm still hyped and awake.
Signal	So I’ve been trying to get to sleep for the last 5 hours. Last night I only got 5 hours of sleep so I should be exhausted but I’m wide awake. My problem now is that I have to be up in 2 and a half hours for work and so it’s causing me extreme anxiety which makes me even less tired. It doesn’t help that the wind is blowing like crazy so things are being blown around outside and it’s loud. I feel like garbage but I’m not going to be able to call into work because I’m one of the only employees left that hasn’t been laid off. I’ve never had issues to this extent with sleeping but it’s terrifying. I feel so out of it. I don’t even have anything I could take to help me sleep. Any tips would be super helpful.
Signal	My routine is awful, specially now that I'm always at home. I usually go to sleep at 4am and wake up at 12pm. If I go to bed earlier than that, I probably won't be able to sleep all night, and I can't really understand why this happens and how to change this. I can't spend all my life sleeping at 4am but I really don't know the best way to change this. Any tips?
NotSignal	I've tried waking up earlier by 30 mins everyday before and it never quite worked for me. The only solution that has always reset my body clock is staying up til the bedtime i want and then crashing.I don't have the strength to do that now though. Been feeling shit the whole week just trying to push bedtime by 1 hour forward each day. I sleep at noon and wake up 8pm.My goal is to reset it to 8am within two weeks.Which is less damaging to the body? pushing forward by an hour everyday, or staying up til the next day and crashing?Any opinions on this?
NotSignal	I found the country that sleep least is Japan, with average sleep duration around 6 hours. But Japanese obviously has the longest life in the world.Sleep less, live longer?
NotSignal	IDK if this is directly related to my insomnia or if it's something separate, which is why I'm asking. Whenener the sun shines I need to wear sunglasses even if looking away from the sun, else it hurts. Same for sound: my mom talks pretty loudly usually and that is already enough for me to have to close my ears after a while. Acute stress happens when my brother or mom puts a glass on our glass table too hard, they always tell me I'm exaggerating (it doesn't hurt their ears). Sometimes I literally get tears in my eyes from it.
NotSignal	Normally work would get me tired enough that I would fall asleep around 1ish 2ish but its almost 2 months since I've worked do to me being furloughed and I think I fall asleep between 4am and 5am. I try to be active in the day time and even exercise but not sleeping is really affecting me big time. I have no energy, motivation and non stop headaches. I havent gone to the doctor because I've always stayed up late and eventually set up a good sleeping routine that would get me 6 to 7 hours a night. Right now I get 3 to 4. My question is what are things that I can do to keep me from tossing and turning in my bed that aren't dangerous to my body. Should I watch tv, listen to music, take walks, exercise, read a book, things like that which I can do after midnight. I figured I might as well be semi productive if I'm just not sleeping. Hope this makes sense
Signal	Hi reddit, I have been diagnosed with insomnia (wake up many times during the evening sometimes for hours).Has anybody had any experience with trazadone?I started to take 50mg two weeks ago before sleeping. Sleep was much better but I still woke up, so my doc recommended me to increase it to 100mg.A week ago I increased the dosage to 100mg for only a day, and since I get dizzy & confused during the day like if I had a concussion. It feels like a brain meltdown,. When people talk to me I have a hard time to underatand them, also I have a hard time to speak. Another thing is that I have hard time walking, like if my ballance where off.I pretty sure this is not normal. Can this be a side effect from the trazadone? Anybody had this and had to change?
NotSignal	Try using ear plugs in a way that allows you to listen to your heartbeat it will calm your racing thoughtsWhy you may ask because when we were in the womb that’s All we could hear and it’s also the reason why white noise help some
Signal	So I was taking mirtazipine before and it did nothing. I would fall asleep for 2-3 hours and just be awake. Absolutely horrible. So yesterday I got prescribed Lunesta 3mg. Well I took it at like 8pm and it didn’t make me tired at all. I ended up waiting till 11 then taking the mirtazipine and fell asleep at like 1 and woke up at 5. I guess that’s longer than usual but I’m groggy and just pretty much devastated it didn’t work. Any other experience? I can’t get benzos cause I used to be addicted as hell. What should I ask for if this still doesn’t work
Signal	Im 23 and single mum to a 16 month old.I've been struggling with my sleep since I was about 19.Obviously as a mother you don't get as much sleep anymore. I haven't slept for more than 3 hours at a time in a bit over 16 month. This isnt an exaggeration. Literally not once.When the baby wakes at night (so every 3 hours or less) im immediately wide awake and it takes me another half hour to go back to sleep on a good night.I physically can't sleep during the day. No clue why, never been able to nap in the afternoon or anything. I could be up all night, as soon as it's like 7pm im in daytime mode and nothing can change that.So im figuring that this little sleep cant be healthy. But the thing is, i dont even feel tired. Ive got loads of energy during the day and even now, at 03:09am, ive been awake nearly 24 hours again, i dont feel tired at all.Is this normal with insomnia? Is there anything I can do?Medication of any sorts is a non-negotiable no for me btw.
NotSignal	After a 9 hour night and sleeping in to 10 am, i fnd myself laying in bed right now 1.47 am :/ with muscle shaking from the huge walk i had and i gotta get up at 6 for work :/, maybe my inner clock will reset with waking up at 6 iguess...
Signal	So, I was prescribed 5 mg of olanzapine daily for its off-label uses, but it made me gain a lot of weight in a short period of time, so I decided to stop taking it without tapering.It’s been a month now since I last took it, and my sleep has been awful. I’ll stay up for two-three days in a row and not be tired. How long does it usually take to normalize sleep after discontinuing olanzapine? I thought a month would have been more than enough time.Appreciate any input!
NotSignal	I haven’t slept very well these 3 days I have to sleep to 6-2 hours in those 3 days
Signal	No medication has been helping to sleep since mirtazapine has stopped working. And I'm also tired of several side effects of tricyclics. Not to mention neuroleptics. After all, I managed to turn 31. There were also wonderful moments throughout the years. Of course, I will not kill myself. But I won't take any more pills either...
Signal	I occasionally have periods of insomnia where I won't sleep well at all for many nights in the row. I will lay awake for what feels like essentially the entire night until daylight. Yet I will clearly recall dreaming. So I have definitely slept a little bit. It feels like I've perhaps drifted very lightly into sleep and dreamed a bit. It is nowhere near the refreshing resetting deep sleep I can sometimes have. I'll feel very tired in the morning like I essentially have not slept at all. What's up with this? What is happening here that I can dream a bit yet not feel like I've actually rested? I was under the impression that dreaming happend during REM sleep and in order to get there you have to have had a full sleep cycle.
NotSignal	How can I fix this? I feel like it's definitely anxiety based
Signal	First of all, please do not recommend CBT. I'm doing very well right now managing anxiety and practicing good sleep hygiene. My problem is working around shifting hormones during my menstrual cycle.*Review of Last Seven Days*In the past seven days, I have been ecstatic. For five days, right after my period ended, I fell asleep within one hour and slept for eight on l theanine 600 mg and 0.125 mg of Klonopin (halved from a dose of 0.25 mg PRN). I stay out of my room until 10 PM and wind down at the end of the day by watching TV with my family downstairs. Then, to feel drowsy enough to fall asleep, I force myself to stay up in bed and read for an hour until I'm super tired.These last two nights, I have struggled with falling asleep again. A possible causes might be lifting boxes (only 10 lbs though) later in the day.*My Past Sleep Patterns*Sleep onset has always been my problem more than sleep maintenance. My mother had untreated mental health problems and would wreak havoc at night. She also would require us through our late teens to be in bed by 730 PM and to wake at 9 AM. As a child/teen, I would be stuck in bed, unable to sleep till about 4 AM; I was super bored and would finally fall asleep, and then wake up around 9 AM.For me, I've found that the advice to get up and move around if you can't sleep doesn't work. This ends up being too stimulating. Just relaxing in bed and focusing on reading myself to sleep is going to have a greater likelihood of me falling asleep.To me, a sleep onset time of one hour is really good--especially with mainly just natural supplements. (I was taking so many prescriptions and OTC antihistamines for a while.)*Solutions*So does anyone have some thoughts on improving sleep onset/reducing sleep onset time? Some things I need to try:* Moving my exercise even earlier in the day (before noon)* Fasting completely in the evening
Signal	I'm 37, m, non smoker (former) non drinker (former) non drug user (former addict 15 years) diagnosed with chronic insomnia, sleep apnea, major depression, and ADHD.Sleep medication I've taken: Melatonin, valerian root, ambien, ativan, Temazepam, lunesta, Zaleplon, Trazodone, Restoril, Doxepin, anything over the counter. I think that's all. With the exception of Temazepam and Melatonin, the meds have given me either adverse side effects or absolutely no relief at all.Currently taking: 1 30mg Temazepam per nightCurrent issues: Trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, multiple nights per week without any sleep, restless leg.I have a dark room, big bed, comfy pillow, cold. I stop screens at an hour before bed. I only use the bed for sleep and sex. I don't watch tv in bed.I do all of this because it's easier to get it all out up front. Anyways, I post because I want to receive some guidance on my next journey. I've been dealing with the same sleep doctor for many years now and he's done a great job at helping me. But this past visit on Thursday we basically reached the end of the road. He told me that he really is out of options and he is not sure what to do next.So I'm now wondering what should I do next. I'm currently dealing with the worst stretch of insomnia I've ever deal with in my life over the last three weeks. I'm averaging about 10 hours of sleep per week. Typically I have two nights back to back where I don't sleep at all. For example this past Tuesday I woke up at 5 and then didn't fall asleep until Thursday at 630am. I just really don't know what to do. I've done blood work and my primary care doctor identified some areas I need to work on. I'm trying to eat a healthy diet. I avoid caffeine at all past 11am. I can't continue to live like this. It's literally driving me into the ground. If anyone sees a med I could try or something else that has worked for you, please let me know. Thanks for reading
NotSignal	DO YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN UP FOR THREE DAYS AND MISERABLE IF I HAVENT TRIED EVERYTHINGALSO I DID NOT EVEN ASK I JUST SAID I WAS TIREDEVEN IF I DID ASK SHUT UP
NotSignal	Been on it for awhile and it’s great for everything besides what I’ve noticed is my sleeping habits. I know meds can go either way but has anyone else had similar situations/how did you deal with it?
NotSignal	tried to sleep. could fall asleep till 3:15. dog woke up at 4:30. school tomorrow. aahdhdhsjadb. it’s now 5. “how to fall asleep in 5 minutes” every insomniac searched that when they were younger, don’t lie
Signal	This just happened now. I have to pay a $17 penalty fee on a morning spin class because I couldn't sleep the night before. Yay
NotSignal	Seriously it’s fucking annoying HOW DO I GO TO SLEEP LIKE AHHHHH and it’s driving me crazy and CRAZY it’s like I wanna jump, scream, shout or rip my own head out it’s like a fucking party in my head and I can’t sleep at all!!
NotSignal	Hi guys, so I don’t have insomnia. I can fall asleep at night normally unless if I get an anxiety attack or something like that.However, I can’t ever get any deep, blacked out sleep. I’m either stuck in the dream phase or just half asleep through the entire night until I wake up. I’m so tired.Does anyone get this? If so, did anyone overcome it?Doctors are having a hard time understanding what I’m going through so they have been of no help. They keep trying to treat me as if I can’t fall asleep but that’s not what’s happening.
Signal	I just started taking trazodone for insomnia and it is definitely helping. I fall asleep after an hour of taking it compared to before I would lay in bed for hours and hours hoping and praying to fall asleep. The problem is that it makes my nose so stuffed up! It’s hard to breathe at night and I hate breathing through my mouth. Has anyone had this symptom and did it eventually go away for you? I’m hoping once my body gets used to this med that it’ll go away. I want this to work 😭
NotSignal	If what's keeping you up at night is worrying about how sleep will affect your skin conditions, what are they gonna say, the same old correlation doesn't imply causation thing? "There's not evidence that suggests that insomnia causes something". Okay but what about worsening something already existing? I'm kind of frustrated. I can't just lie to myself
Signal	Hi guys!(Sorry if my English is not perfect but I’m not a native speaker) I’m a 25F and always had been pretty good at sleeping.. the only thing that bothers me are people making sounds when I’m about to sleep.A month ago I started to have restless sleep.It started with me not being able to fall asleep at a decent time, I wasn’t able to fall asleep before 4 am and I work in the morning.The worst days were a couple of weeks ago, when I alternated no sleep at all to 12 hours sleep the day after.For an entire week this went on, and I started to notice what I was doing during the day that could make this happen.I was destroyed, and it was only a week. (I don’t know how you guys do it for years). So after reading your experiences I decided to make it stop before it got worse. So this are the things that helped me:- I made sure to eat dinner very early (7pm) and light food, I also drank alka seltzer after dinner to make sure I digested everything. (I realized my insomnia started when I had heavy late dinner)- no coffe, frizzy, sugary drinks at all, all day for a week. It was terrible and felt exhausted but I wanted to stop before it got worse.- bought a relaxing tea, lavander oil for my pillow case. - went for walks after dinner to get all the energy out. I had a lot of anxiety about this, and all I could think before bed was me not sleeping.. it was hard to push away those thoughts but what I did was starting to narrate my life in my head when I was in bed just so I could distract myself and somehow I fell asleep. I know it probably won’t help you very much, especially people who have been suffering from this for a long time and already tried everything I listed. But maybe for the new people that just started to have this kind of problem it can help a little.. check what you’re doing during the day of insomnia and see if you did anything different.I hope for any of you guys to have awesome sleep cause you deserve it, life sucks 10 times more with no sleep.
Signal	So I’ll fall asleep right? Amazing.. then I wake up and I think it’s time to get up and I panic and look at the clock. It’ll say like freakin 2 am. Then I’m relieved... more time to sleep... 30 minutes later same thing. Eventually I’m like hallucinating that I have to get up every couple hours. Tossing and turning all night. Then my alarm rings and I’m covered in sweat. Sore from all the tossing and depressed because I actually didn’t see. Yay.
Signal	12 years on ambien. It still works for sleep but ever since going off antidepressant the ambien increased next day anxiety and panic disorder issues. I’ve repeatedly gone off for days at a time and anxiety improves and I get some sleep with Benadryl but then when that doesn’t work and I don’t sleep for days I go back to ambien. TCA’s, remeron has bad side effects. My doctor said he was out of sleep aid ideas. I know I need to this naturally but no success yet. Currently doing mediation and just started yoga. I hadn’t exercised in years so my tolerance sucks but I’ve gotten out and ran half a mile 3 days in a row. My just doesn’t seem to shut down. Intrusive thoughts is very common when trying to sleep.
Signal	Been thrown back into insomnia after a particularly rough episode of PTSD. It's been two days and I haven't slept more than a couple of hours, last time this happened I was like it for weeks and was useless at work. I can't be like that now, I can't not go into work with everything that's happening at the moment and I can't be on half my brain capacity.I feel completely stuck. I think I'm going to try to get a telephone appointment with my GP before it goes on any longer.
Signal	I've been having consistent problems for 6 years now. Most of the time my issue is not about getting to sleep it's staying asleep. I wake up constantly and I'm running on empty. Here are the following things I've tried 1. Seeping tablets (they have a very odd effect on me, my body gets heavy but my brain stays awake) 2. Regular sleep wake schedule3.Regular Exercise (the more intense it is the worse I sleep) 4. No devices an hour before bed5. Meditation/mindfulness before bed6. Anti-depressants7. Anti-anxiety medication 8. Music9. 'Relaxing' sounds like water flowing, rain, birds. All they did was drive me insane. 10. Regular psychologist appointments (actually my psychologist has run out of ideas for what to recommend). 11. Sleep study. They found I have a really unusual sleep cycle but said that it doesn't explain my issues.
Signal	CANNOT TAKE BENZOS (Xanax, Ativan, Valium, klonopin, halcion, etc)What I tried:Trazodone: absolutely don’t like the sensation it gives me when trying to put me to sleep. In fact, I get a bit anxious these days before taking it. Tried 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg over a 2 year time span. Refuse to take this med anymore. Melatonin: low and higher doses never worked for me.Clonidine: doesn’t really do much. It’s supposed to have sedating properties to it but I sometimes don’t feel that. Once in a while it will help me sleep but rarely. Take .2 mgSeroquel: this one IS my favorite. At 25, sometimes 50 mg, it does calm me down if I’m anxious and helps me sleep. However it’s notorious for weight gain and I am putting on some weight. Gabapentin/neurontin - this was for anxiety, not for sleep but either way, gave me blurred vision at a low dose so psychiatrist took me off this immediately.Hydroxyzine - HATE this one too. Took it when I was inpatient and did absolutely NOTHING for sleep or anxiety.Benadryl/NyQuil/ unisom/ Tylenol PM - only one that was effective sometimes was Benadryl. But that was a looong time ago and after abusing Xanax it probably wouldn’t be as effective anymore, esp since it only helped sometimes.Weed - 1. It’s not my thing 2. Only makes me paranoid and not sleepy at all.That’s pretty much it for what I’ve tried. I know my psychiatrist is trying to stay away from the z drugs (like Lunesta, Ambien and Sonata) and I don’t blame her. I really wish Remeron wasn’t so notorious for weight gain or else I’d try it in a heartbeat. But it seems it’s like number 1 for weight gain. I think I’m screwed at this point as far as a medication is concerned :(Am I all out of options here?
NotSignal	It seems like no matter how long I rest my eyes I can't manage to fall asleep or at least enter a very light sleep. I remember once I laid down with my eyes closed for forty minutes relaxed as much as I could and was not able to fall asleep. Anyone else like this?
NotSignal	Any middle aged insomniacs here ? does tolerance of staying awake get weaker by age? am 45 now . It seems when i was younger or at least in my 30s it was easier for me to be straight awake for several days.
NotSignal	Not a political post. A huge part of my insomnia is not being able to turn my brain off and stop thinking about random things. Stuff is crazy in the US right now and even if I don't watch the news, it's virtually impossible to not hear about what's happening from friends, coworkers, etc. At night my mind keeps thinking of all the scenarios that could play out soon and it freaks me out.Do any of you guys get worse insomnia around times of elections or crazy news cycles? If so, in what ways do you cope?
NotSignal	Since I’ve developped Insomnia, It’s like, I can feel sleepy, but not as much I used to be. Like i’ll start yawning at around 11:30 pm and sometimes my eyes will close by themselves at around 12 am but as soon as I actually am telling myself “okay, time to sleep.” it’s like I loose any kind of sleepy feeling and i can be wide awake again. Also, I used to be super sleepy at around 11 pm and couldn’t stay awake later than 12:30 am. Now i kinda have to force myself to go to sleep. If I don’t do that I’ll stay awake the whole night or i’ll most likely getting tired at 7:00 am and sleep until 9 am. Anyone else is like that?
NotSignal	If i slept from 4 pm to 3:27 am is my sleep schedule reset
Signal	My thoughts are always firing off non stop, i smoke alot of bud and concentrates so my tolerance is too high for me to smoke myself to sleep plus we all know thats stupid expensive. I was given a valium before a surgery once and i loved it, it made me mellow and calm and sleep like good indica bud and essentially made me brain dead unless someone or something exterior caught my attention. Thats pretty much what im looking for so im setting an appointment with my doctor. Any advice? Do’s donts? Alternatives u might recommend? I dont plan on using it recreationally but i do have a pretty addictive personality 😂😬🤔
Signal	I cannot sleep at a regular schedule anymore. No matter what I attempt to do, I always revert back to sleeping at 6AM and waking up at 1-2PM. What’s wrong with me
Signal	First of all, I apologize in advance for blowing up this subreddit lately. These last couple of days have literally been hell for me. My anxiety is through the roof. Which keeps me awake of course. Right now is no different. I’ve been stressing over the fact about sfi and all that. The rational part of me knows I don’t have this. But the anxious part won’t let me get any sleep. No matter how tired I am I can’t go to sleep. Plz reassure me I’m not going crazy or have some rare disease. I do live in the USA too. I say this cuz I hear stories about sfi in other parts of the world. Plz help me. I’m over this stuff.
NotSignal	I have not been able to sleep at night for 3 days, I have stayed up all night and fall unconscious for 15 minutes sometimes during the day. Last night I did get to sleep but only at 1:30am and my alarm didn’t go off so I was out of bed at 2 pm. Now my dads mad at me for not getting to sleep. (He doesn’t think I have insomnia) He made me go to bed at 10:00 tonight and I haven’t been able to sleep. It’s 12:20 am now
NotSignal	For the past few days I've been sleeping on my couch regularly as that's normally where I've been able to fall asleep without much difficulties. However the people I live with have been mentioning to me that I'll lay down in my room and apparently fall asleep for an additional few hours even though I don't recall these periods.Could this be sleep misperception? I've never even had insomnia before.
Signal	It's 3:45am. I start work at 9am. I'm laying in my bed, wide awake with my four year old autistic son (who obviously has my same sleep issues).I've been this way my whole life. Without taking hardcore prescriptions, anyone have any advice?
Signal	Guys last week I cut back to half doses on my cannabis edibles for sleep. I tried it with melatonin. Went back to regular dose last night and it made me too wasted to sleep!What happened? What now?3/4 dose?G
NotSignal	if some of yall are bored, you should drop some of your favorite songs/bands for me to check out! really been in the mood to broaden my music taste even more and could really use some recommendations (-:
NotSignal	Monday through Thursday night, I stopped looking at my phone up to an hour to hour and 1/2 before bed, getting in bed by 2 at the latest. That seemed to be working becuse I paired it with valerian tea. But tonight I didn't drink the tea. Guess that's why I'm still up. It's 5:41 and I have an alarm for 5 hours from now. I tried getting up but I feel like crap. Ugh. Don't know what to do because I'm also somewhat itchy. I haven't touched benadryl in a month but I think it's time to pick some up today. Sigh.
Signal	I remember back when I took sleep for granted and would sleep in the blink of an eye and stay asleep all night. It hasn’t happened in a while and I don’t know if it ever will. I’m not going to try anymore though. It is what it is. I’m tired of acting like I’m soft when I know I’m not. I’m going to continue working out 6 days a week regardless of whether I’m rested or not. Fuck sleepNot coming back to this subreddit after today. Hope you guys fix your problems. Bye
Signal	My friend has had insomnia + minor depression for the better part of 2 years now and in the last month its gotten very bad. In the past 2 weeks because he's gotten 30 min of sleep a day along with a terrible diet he started taking a lot of caffeine pills to help give him energy. Any advice that we should do to help him?
NotSignal	Grr! Even the most effective z pill doesn’t work for me! What should I do?
Signal	Okay, so normally I don’t have any trouble sleeping. I do have the occasional (around every 4 months) period of insomnia usually lasting around 2 days. However, I am currently going through something which I could not have anticipated and I do not know why this is happening or what to do.About 10 days ago I had one bad night, followed by a good night, followed by two bad ones. I remember recognizing this at the time as one of my tri-yearly insomnia spouts. However, two nights ago I had another bad night. I don’t fully know why I had a bad night, maybe it was because the melatonin I was taking was causing acid reflux or since I had a coffee at 4:30 the previous afternoon. I got around 5 hours of sleep, felt miserable the next day, but expected the next night to be better.The next night wasn’t the best either. I feel asleep around 2:00, but got up at 6:00. I then fell back asleep at 6:40, but then got up at 9:40. I didn’t know why I woke up so soon after I fell asleep, I was completely exhausted when falling asleep. That day also wasn’t the best, but I was convinced that the next night would be better.Now comes to the this night, where at 5:00 am I am typing this. I have gotten around an hour of sleep so far this night, falling asleep at around 3:20 and getting up at 4:20. This night feels like the worst night. I have this self awareness while falling asleep which I cannot make go away, and this is preventing me from sleeping since I am constantly monitoring how close I am to sleep, which is hindering me falling asleep. I have so far taken two 5mg melatonin tablets, two hours apart, seems like they didn’t do anything. I have spent the entire night moving around my house trying to sleep in different areas to fall asleep, thinking that that might change something. However, I find that when I start to rest in one area, I immediately have an urge to sleep somewhere else, and I cannot shake this feeling until I do it.As I am writing this I feel absolutely awful and exhausted. The best way I can describe it is that I feel like my brain and eyes are tired, but the rest of my body is not. I also feel a loss of control as I don’t know why I am going through this. Can any of you give me any tips on what to do next, or tell me why I seem to find it so hard to fall asleep due to self awareness and why I wake up seemingly sooner and sooner each time I fall asleep? Thanks.
Signal	I swear to motherfucking god this is the second time this is happening in less than a week and all I am asking for is to be able to sleep. But no.Since I'm going out tomorrow, my brain just keeps thinking about how I need to sleep and have the right amount of sleep so I will feel energetic tomorrow and it makes everything worse. Now there is this one god damn song stuck in my head and I have Fall Guys gameplay running in my mind when I last saw a video from that game in the afternoon. I am so fucking done. My brain just doesn't want to leave me alone. Is this so hard to ask for?I slept at like 5am 3 times as I was doing assignments and now it seems like it is the only thing registering in my sleep cycle. It is incredibly FUCKED UP, and I want to fix it so badly but I can't. I am so tired of this. i genuinely just want to cry.
NotSignal	Has anyone tried hypnotherapy? How was it? Was it any good or has it done harm? I'm just looking for some pros and cons about it.
NotSignal	I keep best during the day. I will go days without sleeping in an attempt to reset my sleep cycle (trying to sleep at night)Do you just sleep when you can? Or try and force a normal routine?
NotSignal	listening to old red scare pod and eating cheesecake (or whatever)maybe I’ll finally setup a therapy session in the morning {or whatever}
NotSignal	I just don't get it. For pretty much all of corona my sleep schedule was staying up until 5am and waking up at 3 pm. When school started again, it kinda went back to normal, falling asleep between 1 and 2 am and waking up at 6:30. But now that summer holidays have started, it's gone back to shit. The thing I don't understand is why can't I fall asleep until 5am when I'm tired at 11pm? Tried fixing it by not sleeping at all for one day, but it didn't work :( what can I do?
Signal	Tried going on vacation with my girl over the weekend. It’s 5:52 am. I’ve slept about an hour. Now I won’t be able to do anything with her tomorrow. Totally ruined this weekend we’ve been planning. This happens any time anything happens. I can’t go skiing anymore. I can’t do anything. I can barely work. I’m not suicidal, I have a lot to live for. I am not going to harm myself. But I do fantasize about self harm. I hate myself so deeply for not being able to sleep. Not my character, just my biology. This is so miserable. Not looking for advice, just ranting.
NotSignal	I don’t know why but I get anxious and don’t want to take the medication for the fear that it will make me really sleepy but I will still not be able to sleep.So in a way I kinda just screwed myself by taking the med.
Signal	I've been prescribed clonozapam because nothing else was working. Not trazodone, not antihistamines, not antipsychotics. The last resort was a benzo. Sometimes .5mg works perfectly for me and I fall asleep no problem. Other nights it doesn't seem to work at all. Last night I took it at 12 and didn't fall asleep until after 4. I don't think it's a tolerance issue because it has happened every now and then since I started taking it, and most nights I don't have that problem. Anyone else experience something like this? I'm not sure what it could be, it does make me nervous, though.
Signal	im 14 and i have trouble sleeping. since quarentine started ive been staying up til 9 am. even stayed up a whole day. its been happening often. i tried sleeping early but i just wont fall asleep. i tried tried multiple things online. im about to start school and my sleeping schedule isnt good. i took benadryl which knocked me out. im not trying to take benadryl everyday. i told my mom to give me some of my brother's insomnia pills and she said no that im crazy for thinking that. so my mom doesnt believe me and my health is getting worse. ive been more sensitive and feeling stressed. not wanting to do anything. im not like that. do i need to get this checked?
NotSignal	Start at 7 pm when you should've been trying to UNwind. Preheat oven to tense.1. Last two episodes of TV series The Act, about a lifetime of medical abuse leading to matricide2. The chapter of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with the most intense sexual violence 3. A podcast about a cult leader brainwashing a young girl 4. An unhealthy dose of personal demons ready to be rustled by the above Bake for like 6 agonizing hours, then enjoy a headlong portion of fuck me why do I do this to myself. It's 5 am and I'm about to just give up and... eat breakfast? ugh =(
NotSignal	Ha, fuck! Having GAD, ADD, and a Panic Disorder do not interact well with the inability to sleep like a normal human being. I haven’t had Insomnia in years and all of a sudden the past four days have been utter hell. At most I get 3-4 hours of sleep and it repeats itself.
Signal	Hello everyone! First of all I need to apologize already for my English, because I am not very good in using this language, but I really need to speak with someone about my problem. Its just destroying me. Second of all and of course most important - Sporadic Fatal Insomnia.I am almost 22 years old male and I am truly afraid that I have SFI. My problem with sleeping began almost excatly 2 years ago. From that moment every night I am less or more worried about that I will never sleep again. The start of this bullshit was caused because of my trouble with falling asleep. That night( wish it never happend) I just checked browser for information if there is any chance that people can die becasue of lack of sleep, or can they never sleep again. And there you go. I found what I was looking for. I started sweating, panicking, heartbeat rate was so high and I had so many energy without reason. And I couldnt sleep like before. I was barely able to stay calm. Was trying to logically think that chance is very, very low. But you know - fear of such an ugly death was pretty stronger. Anyways somehow I get used a little bit to it, because fortunately I was able to sleep. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. 5-6 hours, sometimes less, sometimes more: 7-8 hours. Of course during almost every night since that I was awakeing few times. But even when I was after 6-7 hours of sleeping I was fearing of another night thats coming. Every night was like a freaking war I had to win. In some moments of these 2 tough years I experienced muscle twitching and some myoclonus. It lasted 2 weeks or more and then it dissapeard. I was scaried as hell. &#x200B;You also may find it stupid, but I refused to take any pills or medicaments, because I was afraid that they wont help me and it will make me even more scaried that something is really wrong. I was hoping this stupid insomnia will finally leave me alone. Well some time passed while there was hard nights and good ones. I found my first job. It was kinda problem, because i felt anxiety about being forced to wake up at the same time everyday. In the end It was help for me because i started to sleep even faster and earlier, but not every time of course. And we are reaching my today situation. At the weekend I was sleeping more than 8 hours. Then it happend again. This Monday night was hard to fall asleep, had like 4 hours of sleep. After Tuesday night i was hoping to sleep fast, but nothing like that happend. Instead of feeling sleepy I was just tired and exhausted and I managed to sleep another 4 hours. And then finally we have the last night. Horror. Most of the night i was just lying in bed trying to figure out why the hell is this happening. Is that this god damn sporadic fatal insomnia thats starting to killing me? Am I the most unlucky man in the world? Why afetr 2 nights of 4 hours sleep I am feeling so active instead of tired and wasted? This night i have had only 2 hours of sleep. I am not sure. I am so afraid. Its hard to to stay calm. Last 2 weeks I am experiencing again muscle twitching and because of last 3 nights also lack of appetite. I decided to finally seek for some help, but this COVID-19 situation isnt helping. I have enough of this. &#x200B;Please is there any chance that after so many time of trouble sleeping I can have sFi?
NotSignal	I have been tired all day every day for as long as I can remember... I just wanna know how it feels to not be... everything is blurry, I can’t think clearly, I can’t recall the last time I actually enjoyed being aliveCan anyone relate to any of this, or does anyone have any comments regarding? Would be very helpfulThank you
NotSignal	I work night shift. Get home, struggle to go to sleep/stay asleep. This happens for 5 days, then Friday, after my 5 days of deprivation, I sleep the WHOOOLE day. Like 14-16 hours. My alarms won’t wake me up. This happens just about every week. Can anyone relate?
Signal	As the title says: I'm 18 years old and for as long as I can remember I've been dealing with various types of audio and visual hallucinations as I fall asleep or (more commonly) as I wake up in the middle of the night. They often range between "innocent" animals to demonic-like figures, and as for audio hallucinations, 9 times out of 10 it's a familiar voice that says my name right in my ear or its footsteps walking across my carpet. I've never visited a doctor or a psych (I dont have the money for either), or really told anyone about this other than friends and my mom. I originally thought it was some sort of night terror, but then learned about sleep paralysis as I grew up, problem is: I'm fully capable of moving when I hallucinate and I've actually experienced textbook sleep paralysis before and it's a whole-nother level than my regular hallucinations. I'm not a superstitious person so I'm not entirely open to the idea that this is a supernatural, or otherworldly force but honestly at this point I'll take what I can get. I've recently tried everything I could to prevent them like; going to bed at different times, both very late and very early, very late works but I really dont like waking up at 3pm; taking melatonin, which does help me fall asleep but i still wake up in the middle of the night and hallucinate; and yes, a night light, which is deeply embarrassing but seems to work, but makes it very hard to even fall asleep in the first place.Please, if anyone has any idea on what this might be, how to treat it at home, or what my next steps should be I'm basically open to any and all suggestions and I'm able to answer any question that might help you or even interest you. TLDR: I have had very frequent and terrifying hallucinations my whole life as I wake and would like advice/help identifying them. Open to questions if wanted.
NotSignal	Hi, I’m relatively new here because I’ve never this much sleep problem before. In the past I used to take around an hour to sleep, but that’s been my situation my whole life so I never thought about it much. But ever since quarantine started, I’ve been having ridiculous amount of sleep problems. For the last 2 months, the only way I could fall asleep is if I were to take muscle relaxant medicine. I’ve kept a sleep diary as suggested by some webpages and the only thing it has done for me is made me realise my sleeping ability is getting worse. In the beginning, I have just have really short sleep hours, like 3 hours a night. But these days I’ll just be tossing and turning all night if I didn’t take the muscle relaxant pills. As much as possible, I try not to take them because I don’t want to grow dependent on them but the way things are going appears that I’ve already gone down this track. I’m quite desperate as I cannot quite pinpoint the reason why I’m having sleeping problems, as I have finished my exams a while back and I have also received my results, which were decently fine. I have visited my general practitioner and he kept asking me if I have depression or anxiety, and trying to find the reason for my restlessness but to no avail, as I am currently doing nothing at home and have no worries whatsoever. I just don’t feel tired at all, regardless if it’s night or day. It’s getting quite frustrating because I really do wish to get some sleep, and I’m concerned that my insomnia may continue on even when uni starts again, which will impair my learning. It doesn’t help that my Uni roommate is also a loud snorer, and I’m super sensitive to sounds when sleeping these days. I tell myself that it’s normal to have sleepless nights occasionally but it’s starting to get concerning that I’m not even tired at all, despite going a full 96 hours without sleep. The only sign of my insomnia is my darkening eye circles which are worsening by the day, and my super dry eyes. Apart from that, I’m currently still wide awake and at full mental capacity. Eye drops are no longer effective in soothing my pain, and there’s nothing I can do about my panda eyes now. I don’t have any history of psychological illness but any form of therapy is now impossible as well, as my country has ruled that mental health services are non-essential services. I’ve tried everything in the book: cultivating a sleeping routine, drink warm milk before sleeping, sleep in total darkness and silence, reducing blue light after 10pm, accepting that sleepless nights sometimes do exist, but the situation seems to be getting worse and my eyes are really sore right now. Could really take some advice, or recommendations of sleeping aids that I can purchase at over the counter pharmacies. Thanks!
NotSignal	I'm going to skip the long version and lay down the basics; for the past few years I've had steadily declining mental health and part of it is my 'unique' sleep patterns. I usually average around anywhere from 4-7 hours of sleep with pacing around the house in between waking up and falling asleep. At this point its just become a normal routine but it really screws with my day to day life. Whether its mentally with intrusive thoughts and what not, or just feeling too tired to get up in the morning.
Signal	I never tried it for sleep. I'm not anxious. But I fear I could become anxious as the night goes on and I don't sleep.
Signal	Whether it be insomnia, the dog crying, my wife snoring (and other bodily noises(she’s a runner)) or random shooting pains in my knee, it just feels like nobody wants me to sleep these days. Oh well, here goes another 10 hour shift on little to no sleep.
NotSignal	On Friday at 3am I was about to check myself into the hospital because I had no idea what to do. Went on a walk, took a shower, watched some TV with no lights on, no phone, and slept. Every day since I’ve fallen asleep within 30 minutes and slept through the night. I know it’s just 4 days but still. It’s like a flip has switched and I’m not worrying about sleep anymore and now I’m sleeping. I don’t feel depressed or anxious or disassociated... it’s insane.Anyway here’s to anyone who’s at their end thinking it won’t get better. Hang in there, it will.
Signal	(sorry for formatting, mobile posting) I've always had kind of a weird sleeping pattern (awake at night and asleep at day) due to depression and whatnot. A few days ago I started losing sleep by waking up too early, then started having trouble falling asleep altogether. After 30 hours awake and still not being able to get to sleep due to tachycardia and heart palpitations I had probably the worst panic attack of my life, ended up in the ER & was prescribed quetiapine. After another horrible panic attack once I got home it knocked me out for almost 14 hours, but the sleep itself wasn't refreshing at all. I've also noticed muscle twitching and a sort of buzzing/vibrating (don't really know how to describe this?) in my leg... Right now I'm on 24 hours awake, every time I try drifting off I get an adrenaline rush and/or muscle jerk that jolts me awake instantly.I'm very scared, especially after going down the whole SFI rabbit hole that I know is irrational, yet I keep thinking about it... Could this just be 100% anxiety?
Signal	AKA I would smoke marijuana and get blitzed out of my mind to be able to fall asleep. But tonight was different. Despite the comforting arms of my partner I couldn’t find my place in our bed tonight. Anxiety kept me awake my whole life (middle school/ high school.. probably even elementary as well.. if only I could remember that far back) and as I got to be an adult I noticed my anxiety getting worse but my sleeping problems getting better. Of course with the help of CBD and THC I got this issues under control. Or so I thought. All things considering, with this pandemic and stay at home order going on and literally not being able to work at all (I know 90% of people were in this boat as well) I was able to keep my anxiety under control and my sleep schedule as normal as it could possibly get. Nothing exciting y’all. I was racking up about 5 solid hours a night instead of my usual 2-3 hours. But lately I just haven’t been able to keep the eyes shut. I’ve tried sleepy time tea (which actually usually helps me out pretty well), melatonin (which has literally never worked for me) and I’ve even tried reading/ writing. I guess if you have any other tricks up your sleeve send them my way! I’ve always sort of just dealt with my insomnia and thought “Well, I guess it’s better than no sleep at all!” But I like my sleep and I’m no good (mentally, physically, emotionally) without it. Any and all help would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my post and your help is appreciated (if you ever so desire to offer a sound piece of advise.. I feel like I’ve tried everything, but I know there’s gotta be something else)!!
Signal	I ate an edible on May 27 and ever since then I have been on a scary ride and I haven’t come off yet. The day I ate an edible I experienced a panic attack, I eventually calmed down. The day after my heart was beating so fast but I didn’t think much of it I tried to ignore it, the next day it was still happening which was very unusual to me because the brownie shouldn’t be affecting me up to this point. Though the symptoms just got worst as the days went on, shortness of breath, headaches, feeling lightheaded, etc. I went to the doctor everything was ok it was just anxiety but I was confused because I didn’t know that anxiety could cause physical symptoms anyways after the doctor visit things just got worst and insomnia is the worst symptom I’ve face because it makes me so unhappy and make the anxiety worse. I’ve had atleast 3 days insomnia free from May 30 to now and when I had that relief my anxiety symptoms vanished and was literally back to my old self but now it’s back and I don’t know what to do. I usually sleep 9 hours a day and now I would say I get 2-4 hours at best. I can barely fall asleep and when I do I barely stay asleep, it’s exhausting. What can I do to atleast manage this?
NotSignal	I've been trying to help my husband with "sleep hygiene" which involves a schedule and tea and such. He normally falls asleep to tv but not so much lately. Anyway, he just fell asleep to a nature documentary. I guess David Attenborough's voice is more soothing then any sleep playlist I can find. I'm sooo happy but wondering if this is a good idea generally. Is there wiggle room for the typical advice? I am afraid that when I turn it off he'll wake up.
Signal	I work as a server in a restaurant that stays open until 2 AM most nights. Sometimes I leave by 11 or earlier, and sometimes I’m scheduled to close and have to stay until 2 or even 3. This has really thrown my sleep schedule off since I get home at some inconsistent times. I have gotten in the bad habit of drinking diet soda and energy drinks in the afternoon and evening in order to get through my shifts. Now, I can’t go to sleep before 3ish and I can’t wake up earlier than 11 AM. This is really messing with my productivity and mental health since I feel like a failure waking up so late. Any ideas on how to get back on track?
NotSignal	Had bloods and urine test, both turned out fine. Doc wanted to prescribe sleep medication but I want to try out natural relief first. Any insights?
Signal	I recently quit taking an antipsychotic (Seroquel) for my BP and switched to Lamictal ... But quitting the Seroquel has given me insomnia. Has anyone dealt with this? And did it get better.? My psychiatrist prescribed me Klonopin to sleep but it didn't work. I texted her and she doubled my dose. Should I text again? xD
Signal	It's been a full 30 days in which I haven't slept longer than three or four hours a night. I usually have insomnia a handful of days or of the week, but I can get 6 hour respites for at least a few days. This is the longest I've ever gone with such a consistent pattern every damn night. I'm tired of waking up at 1. Even when I try to change my daytime habits/patterns, my nights are the same.
NotSignal	How does this sub have 87,000 people and only 87 are online at 4:30 AM?? Is this not the main can’t sleep/insomnia subreddit? Where can i find people to talk to late at night
Signal	Insomnia is killing me I can’t sleep well can’t even remember the last time I slept at night. I don’t care about the middle school kid who used to bully me or what did that guy mean when he said something to me I just want a break from this. First I thought that I got insomnia from the exams and assignment from my college and told myself that I won’t add any summer classes to try to solve this problem and it was just school and I only needed a break. But little did I know this break didn’t help me and the lockdown isn’t helping either. I am trying my hardest to avoid medications because I’m afraid that I might get addicted to it, if anyone of you guys have a solution or tried something that worked for him/her please help me.
NotSignal	So i was wondering if there was any explanation and or reason that i have sleep paralysis at least once a week. I seem to have a pretty regular lifestyle but the sleep paralysis wont go away. its been like this for around 5-7 months. I do admit that my sleep pattern is messed up but even when i have had 5 nights of good sleep in a row i still get sleep paralysis. does this happen to anyone else? And if so does anyone have a solution to get rid of this curse and or reduce how often it happens? I'd really appreciate any and all tips.
Signal	I wanted to fall asleep a bit earlier because I have a zoom class at 9am so I took a 10mg pill at 1am. By 330am I was still wide awake so I decided to take another one. It's now 6am and nothing.I've been laying in bed in the pitch back, no phone no nothing and I still can't fall asleep...at this point I might as well just stay up for my class
NotSignal	so about a month ago I was dozing off at around 2am when suddenly my heart beat started speeding up out of nowhere. I then stood up and it was still absolutely pounding and for a good minute the only thing on my mind was that I might be dying ... i started making my peace with God lol. I did deep breath exercises then went to the bathroom to wash my whole head with cold water, which then left me feeling extremely cold and shivering violently. my heart rate slowed back to normal and I wrapped up with an extra cover in bed. it then began speeding up again so I went to my parents’ room and woke them up because I was fucking terrified and they called an ambulance. by the time the medics came I was more-or-less settled. they ran some tests and nothing was wrong with me, but from what I’ve researched, I’m 90% sure it was a panic attack; it’s weird because I haven’t been feeling stressed, but I heard panic attacks can be spontaneous. Anyway, ever since that night I’ve had trouble sleeping. heck i’m up at half 6 right now. I’m trying to fall asleep and then when I’m about to doze off my body feels uneasy, like you’re anticipating the big drop on a rollercoaster. maybe it’s because I’m more conscious of my heartbeat. I haven’t noticed any irregularities but i’m often up until about 5 or 6 and fall asleep out of pure exhaustion and it’s completely fucking with me. I’m in the middle of a dissertation and I want to wake up early to work on it but I wake up 2pm, and not ready for the day until maybe 3, by which time my whole work plan is shot and I can’t do as much as I wanted to. I wanted to see a doctor a month ago when it first happened, and I will soon, but I didn’t want to go near a doctor’s surgery or hospital as u can probably understand. this is just a bit of a rant and me leaving my sympathies for people who have had this for more than one little month like I have; I can’t imagine years of dealing with this. my heart is with you all
NotSignal	I keep getting myself in trouble because of manic-like behavior —- I just get like this when I haven’t slept well for a few nights. I thought I had it under control, but now it’s happening again and I can feel my body and mind reving up. Does anyone else have this problem? It’s like I don’t get tired when I don’t sleep, instead I get super excited and my thinking and behavior get weird.I don’t know what to do other than throw a chemical brick at myself every night.
NotSignal	Im not posting here looking to self-diagnose myself or anything but I just want to know if this may be insomnia and might be worth going to the doctors for.So my room is set up so I have my bed in one of the corners and I have to sleep with my back to the wall because if I cant see everything else in my room, I feel like someone or something is there with me and I have to roll back over so I can see everything. Also, if a door is open and i can just see black because its too dark, i feel like something is going to come in my room.Im sorry if this sub isn't for questions like this. I just didnt know where to post this since its starting to bother me a bit since I woke up at 3 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep.
Signal	This is just night 1 for me, my window is 1am-6:30am as determined by CBT-i coach app and I'm really just not sleepy yet. Haven't felt sleepy since I started getting insomnia. Do I go to bed during my sleep window even if I'm not sleepy/drowsy or do I stay up and hope to get sleepy sometime tonight or hopefully by tomorrow night?
NotSignal	Hi all,For those with sleep maintenance issues, how do you manage with going to the gym? Do you still just go and try your best or you work around it?Cheers
NotSignal	I slept solidly for 7 hours last night. That hasn’t happened in 7 years. Tonight, I’ll be lucky to get 7 minutes.
NotSignal	I woke up 2 times during sleep, I slept at 12 and woke up at 3:20, slept again and woke up at like 4:30 then slept again and woke up at 6:30. Even though I woke up like 2 times during the night, can I still count those to total hours of sleep?
Signal	I've been having sleep problems for 4 months I'm 16 male my height is 5'4 geez I wonder why... I've been trying to go to sleep early almost every day because I'm short and to increase my height during puberty I need to sleep lots but I can never sleep until 1 or 2 am and I only sleep for about 5 hours its destroying my hormones and stunting my growth this is a real issue I dont eat before bed in fact I workout so I get tired and then take a hot shower so I feel more tired but nothing helps and I'm starting to go crazy idk what will happen to me.
Signal	I need sleep once it hits morning it’ll be 48 hours no sleep I can’t sleep I’m tired mentally but I can’t sleepEvery time I try I’ll sit not thinking for so long and nothing happensI can’t take Benadryl and stuff and that type of stuff just wakes me upNo melatonin in my house because it doesn’t workI’m crying in my bed because I wanna sleep I just want rest it’s not healthy to be up this long. I’m afraid of what it’ll do to me physically and/or mentallyPlease any suggestions at all I’ve tried so much like different locations, my weighted blanket, reading, short distractions, comfort items, warm shower, it just doesn’t work and I need it toWhat am I supposed to do? College starts tomorrow now. I need sleep for it. It’s mandatory to go first day. I can’t just waltz up to the doctor at 2:40 AMSo please if anyone has any suggestions please let me know
Signal	I went to bed last night at 9 which is pretty late considering my alarm goes off at 345am for work. I work a messed up schedule 12hr shifts 7 days out of every 14. Mon Tues Friday sat sun one week and wed Thurs the next week. It seems like it would be an awesome schedule since I have so many days off but it really messed up my sleep schedule. I made a horrible habit of sleeping in on my days off because I didn't get enough sleep on work days. Long story short it's been increasingly difficult to sleep the last month or so. Last night I laid in bed awake from 9 pm until 3 am. Finally fell asleep some time after 3. Alarm went off and i got up and showered and went to work. It should also be noted that I struggle with depression and was in a really dark place last night. When I woke up after my 30ish min nap I was in a fantastic mood. Idk what changed. I was super hyper all day. Like couldn't sit still hyper. And I expected to be exhausted when I got home at 6pm tonight. Well here it is almost 1am and I'm still awake. Other than a slight burning in my eyes I don't feel tired at all. I despise laying in my bed and not sleeping. As a result I don't got to bed til I am actually tired. I've tried diaphenhydramine in the past and unless I take it 8hrs or more before I need to be up it makes getting out of bed super difficult. I've in the past been on a variety of medications to help me sleep and anything that is strong enough to put me to sleep also makes it nearly impossible to wake up when I need to. Ambien and elevil are examples. In order to be able to wake up I had to take it 12hrs before I needed to be up. That wasn't sustainable. I'm super frustrated right now and I mostly just needed to vent. But I also wondered if anyone else experiences they hyperactivity when they are sleep deprived or the being awake an excessive number of hours and not feeling tired at all. It's new for me and I'm trying to figure out if this is common or might be part of my ongoing mental health issues.
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for over four and a half years now, and I honestly wouldn’t believe it four and a half years ago to believe I’d still have it today. My insomnia just started out of the blue, and it’s progressively starting to worsen. I’ve gone days with zero amounts of sleep and I have absolutely no idea what’s causing it. Just like everybody else, no medications work and my doctor won’t even prescribe me ambien because he says it’s not good for chronic insomnia. I’m really scared and I don’t know what to do :(. Please pray for me. My brain just doesn’t want me to sleep and I don’t know why....:(
NotSignal	I haven’t been going to bed at the appropriate times because I want to have “the perfect morning and nighttime routine” along with the “perfect time to go to sleep” before I can act on it. So until I figure all of that out. We out here at 5am. This mindset affects a lot of things in my life but I will leave it at that. Like I won’t make it good or even start unless I’ve figured it out to the T and it’s perfect
Signal	I usually stay awake 3-4 days a time, my max was between 5-6 days. That was horrible and physically painful.Do you have the same or different side effects?These are my side effects:Physical tiredness of entire body (slow mode)Minor balance issues when turning or changing walking direction (like arms out, on one leg, to find balance again)Jumpiness - scared of my own shadow moving (fingers, arms), easy to scare, seeing "things" that aren't there when you look, but you don't see any object just sensation something moved. Corners are a nightmare...Sudden tiredness - can "nap" while awake, you still hear your surroundingsNo energy - dead weight, if combined with sudden tiredness, I might fall asleep.Itchy eyes, red eyes tooI forget most days, I can't remember what I said or who I met or what happened the day before, and complete memory loss of days prior to the day before. Unless I'm triggered by something.Problem formulating a sentence, sometimes just words with sounds in-betweenLack of taste of things you know you likeSore neck, joints, musclesSad mode - can cry for nothing, if it feels a tiny bit happy/sad/emotionalAngry mode - easy to piss offUsually day 4 onwards, depression and bad thoughts, acting on them.If you make it to day 5-6, everything above is maxed out and I feel my body just forces my brain to shut off. Then sleep 8 hours, and repeat.
NotSignal	It went from one an hour ahead of bedtime, to two and then three, et cetera. It worked for a while, and on rough sleeping days they’d have so drowsy that I could only sleep. But I took three last night and had two straight dreams of my brother committing suicide. The day before I had a string of dreams of my mom dying. Both days I woke up with such red puffy eyes that it looked like I was crying while I was sleeping. I don’t know if there’s any correlation, but it’s enough to make me throw out the bottle. This has never happened before, and it’s weird to have dreams like that two days in a row.Now I’m stuck awake with work bright and early in the morning. It was nice having a twinge of normalcy but I guess good things don’t last very long.
Signal	Before this quarantine, I worked in nightlife on weekends and has a Sonata script to help me get more sleep on weekends (instead of waking up at 9am after working all night). I know that’s not sustainable and it’s obviously on hold now. Which has also meant a more stable sleep schedule (great!) and the reoccurrence of my life long sleep problems. Wondering if any of you know if there are any longer term drugs that help with sleep quality and awakenings. This has been ongoing for over 10 years, mostly in the form of sleep maintenance insomnia. Or I wake up after 5-6 hours of sleep way too full of energy, only to crash hours later. I’ve tried sleep restriction therapy to no avail. Melatonin doesn’t resolve it. Hell I’ve even tried Xyrem and that didn’t either. I happen to have a pituitary tumor and a pineal cyst, which doctors have said may very well be related. I have an appointment to discuss gabapentin as an option, but I’m not sure long term that works. In the last 15 or so years, the closest thing to a solution has been sleep deprivation on the weekends, so that my body is forced to sleep 8+ hours during the early half of the week (and it feels wonderful).
NotSignal	Oh gee, wow, I _love_ insomnia, it has so many neat features. Like not being able to think a coherent thought after your third day of not sleeping, or hyper fixating on every little, silent, normal noise in the middle on the night with intense loathing. Super great stuff.But humor aside, I was wondering if any of you experienced this too? I get bags a lot, but they’re not _that_ bad, although sometimes I looked aged like ten years when it’s been a particularly bad month. But recently, I’ve noticed that under both my eyes, there’s blue veins that have become more and more noticeable and now they won’t go away. :-)I looked it up and didn’t see any correspondence with lack of sleep, as they say aging causes the skin around your eyes to lose it’s thickness, especially for really pale people like I am, but: I’m still really young, I never go in the sun (especially without sunscreen), I have a decent skincare routine and have for years, I eat healthy and drink lots of water, and my only “bad habit” is not being able to sleep. Not a single other person in my family, anywhere down the line, has had this happen so I kind of highly think it’s related to my insomnia.Do any of you have them? Do you think it’s from your insomnia? I hate this.
Signal	Since I scroll through this forum a lot and although I haven’t really seen anything that is novel in terms of solutions, I found a lot of solace in knowing that I’m not alone. Because sometimes insomnia feels that way, since it’s quite rare for a living organism to not be able to sleep. But anyway something that has worked a few times in the past and did last night is a device called Bellabee. It sends EMF into the base of your brain to help with sleep. It costs about 60 bucks but if anyone is desperate, it does work. When all medications fail, this somehow puts me to sleep. I stopped using it because after a few days, it wasn’t working for me but the first few days after not using it for a while, it always works.
Signal	I usually sleep at 11pm - 12am but nowadays I struggle to sleep and fall asleep at 1:30am-2am. Now(The time I'm writing this) it's 6:08 am and I still haven't slept.If you ask me, my family is slowly falling apart... I have some psychological problems and I have went to psychologists and psychiatrists with my parents' permission. Feel free to answer because I need answers.
NotSignal	I just thought I'd throw this out there... I'm already trying everything under the sun to get a better night's sleep. It is moderately effective to ineffective. The reality is--- I'm living with daily chronic sleep deprivation. I'm not looking for tips on how to get a better nights sleep... Got plenty of those. What I'm looking for is supplements/minerals/vitamins/foods etc I can consume to try to ease the damage this does on the heart. Especially things that would help the heart slow down to avoid the long term damage of the speedy heart that sleep deprivation causes. I'm already pretty knowledgable about the fact that dietary changes related to insomnia (ie overeating/consuming more carbs) is one of the factors that cause people problems who are in my shoes. I'm doing everything I can to mitigate that. I'm just wondering if anyone has done some good research on this because I'm having little luck with searching it out online... Every search I do just leads me to things that help you sleep better- Not things that help you cushion the damage of sleep deprivation on your heart. I know nothing replaces a good night's sleep, but I'm wondering if there might be some things to take that help the body replace what I'm losing when I don't rest. Thanks.
Signal	Insomina is a bad thing for almost everyone, but insomnia is treatable with medicine and improvement of sleep can be noticed instantly.There are many options depends on what kind of sleep problem you have.For most patients that can't fall sleep, Ambien is the first line choice of medicine. Ambien can even be taken long term nightly without developing tolerance in most patients.For those with sleep maintainance problem, Ambien together with some benzo may help, or you can try Doxepin low dose. They are all approved by FDA for treatment of insomnia.If you fear about dependence on benzo, don't worry too much about it. If you sleep well, then everything is fine. Your body may need that medicine, and they have very few side effects.Don't be afraid of medicine, and you will be free from insomnia.It is also helpful for you to try CBT-I, but that's pretty hard for many.
NotSignal	It's currently 2:24 am right now. I've tried sleeping already but it doesnt work. Last night i had no sleep. People keep saying it's the electronics but I didnt have any last night, until I gave up at 5 am and watched a show. I dont know where my sleeping pills are and I'm in a vicious cycle of not sleeping at night, staying awake for 90 percent of the day and then falling asleep right before the end of the day begins. I wake up at the end of the day with a full night's sleep worth of energy and it repeats.
Signal	Hi all,I hope you are all well. Firstly I wanted to remind you that you are not in this alone. studies show just over 50% of people struggle from insomnia, mild or serve it can vary. I think I have a very mild form of insomnia.I normally average 7/8 hours of sleep on a night but now and again I can go weeks with just 2/3 hours a night. Sleep is a very hard subject to touch on as everyone associates it differently. I would suggest if you cannot fall asleep within 30 mins to leave your bed. Stress and anxiety built up on your bed will make you suffer more. I get really anxious when I can’t sleep, but it is fine. Yes you should ideally be getting 7/8 hours per night. I normally get out of bed and do something? Like clean the house, play some games or watch videos if I can’t sleep. I end of dozing off.Sleep deprivation is on the top of torture. It’s horrible, hallucination, fatigue, cloudiness. More people die of sleep deprivation accidents than drink and driving.You are not alone in this fight, you can do it. I haven’t been sleeping much lately. So if you want message me for a chat or anything.Thanks for reading,
NotSignal	Yesterday, I had a strong disagreement about politics with a friend. After that we stopped to speak, and I didn't success to sleep. All my thoughts were related to all these political stuff that I hate so much. I don't care if I will ever speak to my friend again. I just want to find inner silence and sleep...
Signal	Two months of sleep maintenance insomnia has gotten worse. My normal sleep is 10:30-5:30/6. Lately it’s been 11-3 am and then I fall asleep around 4 and up at 5 but with several interruptions. Now I’m averaging around 3-5 hours a night, feel horrific. Last night was first sleep restriction, journal, and PMR. I think it may have helped a little. Fell asleep a bit after 12 then up at 1:45 then up at 4:45 then up at 5:30 - so not consolidated but 5 hours without Xanax or OTC which I needed this week. I did take valerian, PS, zinc at 11:45. So sounds like I need to go to bed at 12 each night until it’s consolidated then move back to 11:30. Any success with this? After a recent break-up I feel terribly lonely and have CPTSD. I do need to find trauma treatment as my CBT/ISF therapy isn’t helping.
Signal	I take on average 3-4 hours to fall asleep every night. It's been this way a long time, starting when I was in early middle school. By now I've tried: tea, reading, exercise, turning off my electronics, adjusting my pillows/blankets/temperature,meditative breathing, and melatonin.While I've never gotten a formal diagnosis, I think I have some type of sleep disorder. My mind races, .It can't and won't shut up. My leg wants to bounce, I get very hungry, even if I ate dinner and had a light but protein filled snack after. I can lay and feel tired but sleep wont come.I admit the internet has kept me awake before,but its not the main factor, even before I got my own personal device (age 14) I've had this issueI try not to eat after 8;30 and I usually don't. It's just so frustrating, I still no matter what wake up at around 7 am every morning. if it helps for you to know, I have adhd and mild autism. Posting this isn't going to solve my problems i know this. Later in September I'll see my doctor but I want to rant, and rant I will. If the quality of my writing (was there any to begin with?) goes down its the sleep deprivation talking.Hopefully my doctor can get me therapy or stronger meds, or maybe the government (I'm in care) can get me a weighted blanket IDK. I don't want my school year hijacked by this.
Signal	I usally get four maybe five hours a night but every few weeks there will be a spell where i just can't. Going on my fourth night now with a total of maybe two hours of sleep and i just freaking hate it. Like fully functional each morning going through my routine but i know it has to be terrible for me. Any hints or tips for someone with no med access
NotSignal	5am, can’t sleep, just made a bomb ass sandwich tho, hope yall keeping good and safe
Signal	I have been experiencing what I believe is insomnia for my whole life. I cannot sleep in beds, I can really only sleep on couches or in my office chair (I sleep there for the most part) and even when I’m fucking exhausted I still can’t make myself sleep. I’ll keep my eyes shut and wake up maybe 15 minutes later with my heart racing and covered in sweat. When I do sleep, and especially if I have my alarm set, I’ll wake up within a few hours (4 or so,) well before my alarm and unable to go back to sleep. Is this insomnia or just weird shit?
Signal	Has anybody else noticed that taking birth control in the evening (instead of the morning) seems to improve that night’s sleep. A week ago I forgot to take my pill so I took it in the evening and it seemed to make a difference. Now I’m going to try taking it only in the evening. I seem to have a super liver (this might explain why there’s a difference) eg. when I take sleeping pills they usually only last 4 hours. I generally avoid sleep meds as I believe when you really need it it’s better to be low tolerance. I also do this with coffee - I don’t have it very often so that when I really “need” it, it works. Has anyone else heard about the connection between sleep and oestrogen? It got me thinking about oestrogen deficiency in men and women. I had my fertility checked a few years ago and the doc said all was fine so I guess it’s not a healthy range thing but I’ve been an insomniac my whole life- maintenance and onset as a child too. It’s normal to me and I learnt to “pretend” to sleep when I was a kid. And no it has not been one long bout of insomnia - it comes and goes. I read that there’s a known link between the menstruation cycle and insomnia but not much research. Has anyone heard of any related theories and or research?
NotSignal	I constantly wake my self up in fear i will have another one. Even tho i remember nothing it was the scariest thing ive experienced, all the screaming and crying no one of my brothers or mother could come to help me. I felt alone and vulnerable. I NEVER want to feel that again.
NotSignal	So what if sometimes I can't sleep, I would sleep the next day if I could. And at some point I would be up and switch to a daytime schedule again. Anyone successful in finding a life/job for sleeping on your schedule instead of cramming in 8 hours when it's not gonna happen naturally. I'm not so sure we're the problem...
NotSignal	My body seems to suck at regulating temperature. It wasn't always like this; I remember all my life up to only a few years ago I was sleeping with the same type of blanket in summer,winter, whatever the temperature. Now however, this is way too hot for me in the summer, even sleeping completely naked without any blanket is still too hot on some days. Same thing for the winter: I sometimes need an extra blanket, and this wasn't the case in the past. Another association here is that I can go to bed and be at comfortable temperature, only to wake up a few hours later feeling incredibly hot (or cold covered in sweat). Is all of that due to insomnia or does it point to something else (something that may also be the root cause of the insomnia perhaps) ? Like nutrient deficiencies, diseases, disorders.
Signal	Hey everyone - my boyfriend goes through phases every few months where he has a lot of trouble sleeping. Like he'll try to go to bed at a reasonable time (11pm), but then not be able to fall asleep until 3 or 4am. And when he doesn't sleep well, he'll get anxious about sleeping well the following night, which then leads to another poor night of sleep. This usually lasts for about a week at a time. It really impacts his mood and happiness, and I'm really struggling for ways to help him through it. I'm hoping to get some pointers on:1) Strategies that have helped others that have experienced this that I could encourage him to try2) Things that you wish a partner/friend would say/not say to you when you you're struggling with not sleeping. I'm trying my best to be supportive and positive, but it usually feels like I can't say anything right. Thanks a ton :)
Signal	Since I can remember it always has been this way. I can't understand why and I thought it was pretty normal until I realized that members of my family don't have that frequency. What does that mean ? It's getting me exhausting and I don't know where it comes from, I haven't found anything on internet about this, except talks about trauma, but the victims mostly do the same nightmare iver an dover, I don't.I've tried pillz but I still do nightmare and don't sleep more.Any thoughts, advice ?
Signal	So I haven’t had a good night’s rest in so long since my dog died on my birthday, June 28, 2020. Occasionally I would be able to go to sleep, but these days it’s just one thought leading to another. I’ve been having symptoms of anxiety like palpitations and it’s driving me nuts. I just want these palpitations to go away. I also just want to stop thinking about getting enough rest because i end up not feeling rested at all. I’ve been in bed by 2 am for the last couple of days. I cried last night in the shower after work because a patient died and their family members were crying and it triggered me because I know how it feels to lose someone you love. How do I stop obsessing over my ability to sleep and heart rate? How do I stop having the urge to check my heart rate and blood pressure? How do I stop these anxiety symptoms? Help?
NotSignal	Can anyone please recommend a good sleep medication, one that gives restful sleep and does not result in next day drowsiness. Thank you.
NotSignal	When i close my eyes, even when i feel tired and exhausted i cant fall into the state of visions before my inner eye. Its just black. In the past when i closed my eyes i could see and visualize positive thoughts and pictures and felt asleep. I feel like this for a month now and it gets really bad. I also dont feel my body and feel different.
NotSignal	Is there some kind of device that can zap your brain and make you sleep ?Kind of like tms or something. I just want to be unconscious
NotSignal	How does sleep deprivation affect social interaction and speaking/conversation? What are tell tale signs besides yawning that scream im exhausted? When speaking with someone, what makes you firmly believe the other person is beyond tired? Sorry if this doesn't fit the criteria.
Signal	Heya,I've had terrible insomnia for awhile now, where I believe this onset from puberty and onward where every time I don't really feel super tired, somewhere my body itches in some location as I try to alleviate it, and then it itches at a new location the next minute. Try as I might to ignore it, it becomes too much and I succumb to the urges in less than 10 minutes, ruining my doze to sleep. It's really fucking annoying and has been such a big issue in my life. As I speak, I'm writing this post 5 AM in the morning because my body keeps itching. I'm now 20, male.This issue only seems to occur specifically when I'm forcing myself to sleep in any way, as I don't really have annoying, haphazard itches any other time really. Showering right before bed doesn't seem to help the issue at all. I don't really actively exercise. Whenever I'm extremely tired or take 10 mg of melatonin, the urge to sleep overpowers the urge to alleviate any itches that comes shortly after because I tend to crash pretty fast, so that's how I reliably get to sleep most of the time nowadays. But there's occasions where that doesn't work for some reason such as right now, and I'm lying in bed realizing yet again that I'll be waking up past 4 PM.I've tried doing some research on this topic, but my results came somewhat futile. Does anyone know why this happens to be the case or can at least relate? Any ways that I can alleviate the itches without moving my body? I'm confident that I can lull myself to sleep naturally as long as I don't move my body, given that I've done it on rare occasions where my body doesn't haphazardly. Sources appreciated.
NotSignal	So after returning back to my country during these times, I was put in a hotel room for 14 days of quarantine (which i don't disagree with). And of course my chronic insomnia decided that it's the perfect time to fuck me over again.. I'm on day 4 without sleep, 10 more to go!
Signal	I’ve had insomnia since I was a teenager and been able to manage on small portions of sleep, 3 hours or so. Now I’m 30, I can barely function with 5-6 and if it’s 3 hours, I’m a bit of a wreck.I’ve been dabbling with CBTi but decided to put all other life plans (certain evening work, weekend plans) on hold for the 4-6 weeks starting Monday. I’ve been trying to make my wakeup time at 7.00 but my cycles all out of whack again and I’ve been falling asleep at 4-6am and waking up at 10am-12.30pm, which has been kind of regular. Each alarm at 7.00, I wake up pretty groggy, walk outside to turn it off and fall back asleep. I’ve tried post-its, special alarm apps, water, but I really struggle to get up. Maybe it will improve a bit now that I’ve made this my focus this week and trying to put in all effort to exercise, fast, remove stressors, etc, yet 12.30am now and I can’t sleep. I assume that my body will want to get tired at 4am again and I’ll be stuck. I also don’t have any work at the moment to motivate me to get up like usual.I’m considering staying up until the next night but I seriously hate this. I’ve had to do this several times over the last few weeks and nothing destroys me emotionally like 36hours awake. Even then, I still struggle at night sometimes. Is there anything else I can do? Or does anyone have anyone have any advice/encouragement if you’ve been in the extreme end of sleep deprivation/cycle alignment.
Signal	Sleep and I, haven't had a good connection in a while. Started when I was like 15. My mom coming down to my bedroom to see if I was awake and getting ready for school. Awake mom? Of course i am! I never went to bed. Getting ready for school? How could I? My brain is wired and my body feels like stone. Heavy. Dead weight. Somehow my body also feels bruised and worn. As if sleep exhaustion took so much from me. Even from the simplest task of tossing and turning exhausted my core. I would confess my issue. She would look at me and blame it on the technology. Phone must be keeping me up. Little does she know I spent a good 4 hours laying on my back and staring at the ceiling. But I'm tired. I don't argue. I get dressed. Walk to school. See my friends with my signature purple under eyes. To them I'm normal. Funny. Talking. Saying the right things. Behaving normally. Going through the motions. But in my head I'm cracking. In my head I'm paranoid. I'm disassociating when I have too much time to my self. I'm failing school and drawing doodles on my notebook. Over thinking about my self and drawing those Scary tired eyes. But I still laugh and I'm bubbly. It was a routine. This is the easy part of the battle. In those times I never knew the real struggle would be after highschool. when I had to go to work on time. When the crash would hit on a Wednesday. I'm scheduled at 9 but my body can't give anymore and I'm about to sleep for 15 hours. It's my 5th call off in a month. When I would work double shifts from 9am-1 am and still stay up until 4 or 5. Then go right back to work at nine. Completely manic and trying to keep it together. When the vivid gory nightmares started plaguing me. When sleep paralysis held my body still during my dreaming limbo and convinced me someone is breaking into my home to attack and rape me. I couldnt move. My Brain would play the tricks on me. I could hear the door open, the running up the stairs. Convinced I was about to die and I couldn't even move in protest. When actually sleeping couldn't be a relief because every other night was the nightmares or the paralysis. The heartbreaking battle of looking at my boyfriend and best friend of 7 years. Seeing his tired eyes trying to keep up with me and sacrificing his own sanity. Just so I wouldn't be alone. Being 22 struggling for years and always wondering. Why can't I find my rest? Why can't I be at peace? Dramatic as it seems it feels like I won't truly rest until I die
NotSignal	Not sure if this may apply here, but does anyone have an issue with getting at least more than 7 hours of sleep if you work out a couple hours, say in the evening before you fall asleep? I used to get bad sleep when I was in college lifting but now I’m back home during quarantine and I was getting pretty good sleep during quarantine (7-10 hours) and when the gym opened back up and I’m pushing it hard for a full hour and now I’m back to getting less than 6 hours of sleep.Does anyone else have this issue or is the gym to even blame? It’s also not great especially for recovery..
NotSignal	Who wants blueberries on top and who wants whipped cream? Both is also an option. If anyone wants strawberries on top I think I have some left in the fridge. You guys are going to have to be quite so we don’t wake up my parents. Thanks ❤️
NotSignal	Geez why .... All I want is just a few hours.
Signal	So I’ve suffered with insomnia most of my life due to HPA axis dysfunction and copper toxicity.I’ve been studying “psychobiotics” which are probiotics that increase certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Anyway, I’ve found that Lactobacillus Helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum both increase concentrations of GABA in your brain.Interestingly enough most of our neurotransmitters are created by the bacteria in our gut, called the “gut brain axis”I have a specific probiotic I use I get off amazon but I imagine I can’t post a link like that here.Here’s the kicker though, if you want it to work immediately, your going to have to start off with a high dose. Taking the recommended amount will take a long time for the bacteria to build up, and even then it might not reach amounts that make a big enough difference .I personally start off with 150 billion CFU’s and go from there.The common side effects are gas, stomach aches, and heart burn, but this is only temporary and is caused by the good bacteria killing off the bad bacteria, and they subside within a few days.Honestly this has been the only thing that’s been able to help me. Better than Xanax, better than antipsychotics, better than weed, and better than ashwaganda. Just go to amazon and look for “mood” probiotics. Most of them will have these two strains listed. And there’s no risk of withdraw if you stop taking them. I’ve been on and off them for the last couple years.It’s also a good way to lower tolerence to GABA drugs such as benzos and phenibut. Let me know if you have any questions.Good luck everyone!
NotSignal	I just stayed up the whole night, its 7 am currently. I usually stay up until 4 or 5 but this is the latest I’ve stayed up and I can’t fall asleep at all. I think its because I fiddle on my phone every night.
NotSignal	Almost 5 am with no sleep. Time for a celebration. Why does this happen to me
Signal	6 years since my last big episode, then sleep like a baby night after night with the odd bad one here and there like everyone does, but back to normal the next night without issues. Loving sleep.Then a bout of insomnia out of seemingly nowhere. 2 or 3 weeks of rough sleep.Then 2 or 3 weeks of normal again. Feeling great again.Bam, another bad night. And another. And another. Ugh make your god damn mind up. "Something's on your mind".Yeah, why I haven't fallen asleep yet. I'm not stressed, no money issues, Covid hasn't got me worried really. I'm bored and using less energy sure, so why am I sleeping fine for weeks during lockdown then suddenly not sleeping well for weeks doing the same stuff everyday.*sigh*Weeks of sleeping great and then boom, tossing and turning waiting for sleep until gone 4am and the sun's coming up. The pass out and get woken up by my alarm 3 hours later. Zombie mode activated.Humans are amazing but some times, I fucking hate emotions and having such a complex brain. My dog falls asleep in seconds. SECONDS. Why the hell can't we do that.
Signal	I’ve had insomnia every since I can remember. I’m 28 now and I’ve tried pretty much everything to benzodiazepines, sleep prescriptions and over the counter sleep aides. Lately it’s been getting worse and I want to sleep so badly. I’ll admit I take my zolpidem at my normal time around 8pm and the past two night my oldest son has been really enjoying doing the faschnat event in fallout for we’ve been staying up a little later. But once I am in bed my mind races and thinks of anything and everything. I just got up not long ago and did the dishes because it was bothering me that they were piled up. I’ve tried getting off of my phone but with the recent riots and protesting has me on edge. Although I don’t live in a city where it is happening violently. My city has now set a curfew. I have kids at home and live on the bottom floor of an apartment. So when I see shadows outside my windows I get spooked. Even though I know for a fact all of our windows are locked I get up to recheck. I took a nap last night for about two hours which was nice but now I’m still awake and I have to take my youngest to the doctor early in the morning today and have work afterwards. And on top of this I’m dealing with personal health issues that have me freaked out so I think about that a lot too. I wish I was one of those people who can just lay in bed no problems and just go to sleep and wake up refreshed. Over the past week I’ve gotten maybe at best about 5 hours of sleep before I have to get up with my kids. I don’t know I just needed to get this off of my chest to people who understand what it’s like to have insomnia.
Signal	Hello all, I began taking trazodone over the summer (early June) to treat my insomnia and anxiety. Trazodone +ativan usually puts me to sleep pretty well however I would always feel groggy/ foggy in the head all day the next day however it was not so bad to cause anxiety. I usually would only take 50-100mg. I decided to wean off the trazodone as the side effects were not pleasant. 1 month ago, I took maybe 25mg/night for 2 weeks. 2 weeks ago I stopped taking trazadone completely and ever since I have experienced frequent nausea, dizziness, and increased anxiety (probably a few other symptoms as well). I have never felt symptoms like this before and it is extremely uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing. Last night I smoked some weed around 4pm, at 7pm I started feeling dizzy, out of it and then had a panic attack where I became extremely sweaty w rapid heartbeat. I was convinced I had serotonin syndrome due to the combination of trazodone withdrawal and come down from the weed (reasonable, I know). I feel like I never took a super high dose and I kind of slowly tapered off the trazodone . I am however relatively sensitive to medication changes, I was just wondering if anyone had experienced intense nausea and anxiety coming off trazodone and if anyone has experience combining weed and trazodone withdrawal and how long anyone has felt the side effects of trazodone withdrawal. I hear a lot of people had dry mouth and I never experienced that at all. Crazy how everyone responds differently. Thank you very much in advance.
NotSignal	I've been browsing this sub for a while. Previously I just thought I had a bad sleep schedule and that was why I could never get more than six hours or fall asleep in less than two hours. Sometimes I will lie in bed for hours with my eyes closed and not fall asleep. I heard a lot about people with sleep disorders disliking fake insomniacs so I'm cautious to say I have a sleep disorder. I'm also currently unable to access the means to get a proper diagnosis.tldrit takes me at least two hours to fall asleep if I fall asleep at all. I haven't gotten more than six hours sleep in over a year. I can't get diagnosed and I don't know if this means I have a sleep disorder.Sorry for messy post.
Signal	I haven't sleep for two days before. Today, I've took my grandma's pills (benzos) and it knocked me off, so I've sleept.But, I still feel like I am at brink of death.My muscules hurt, I have random chills, twitches, I barely have the strenght to even write or hold my phone, to hold anything and my heart is pounding. My speech is slurred. When lying in bed, my mind wanders and I can't "clear it" no matter what I do. Or don't do. Seems like I have random anxiety attacks related to yet next night without sleep + some extra shit, because my mother killed herself not so long ago and I can't clear my mind at all. I'm a school now and my teacher refuses to let me go home, she probably doesn't take it seriously, "You HAVE to be in school". I had a short episode like that before, but melatonin worked most of the time, now seems like it stopped.
Signal	I'm scared of sleeping. My insomnia started from just not physically being able to fall asleep but wanting to, after a couple months of getting less than 20 hours of sleep a week, I started to reallt struggle. I started to when I was finally falling asleep, my body waking me up after an hour or two. This obviously annoyed me because id struggle to fall asleep again and this went on for a couple months too, but this was better because I was getting more sleep than I had been, it was just very disturbed. Then i started getting nightmares. every night. the same nightmare. id dream about drowning. myself drowning, other people drowing- to the point they arent even nightmares anymore, just dreams. When my nightmares first started though, as I woke up i kept thinking I could hear screaming. but i couldn't. As time passed on, I didnt just hear screaming as I woke up, but voices too. just talking. but none of it was there. I started getting nervous about falling asleep because I knew how id wake up. but eventually it got worse. I heard screaming and voices as I was starting to fall asleep. enough to make my whole body flinch, sit up and open my eyes in less than a second. at first I thought it was a one time thing and it wouldn't happen again but it started happening more and more frequently and before I knew it, I'd become scared to fall asleep, desperate to not hear the screaming and voices. I just want to know if anyone has experienced anything even slightly similar and how they dealt with it because its really affecting my day to day life and im constantly exhausted.
NotSignal	and it is driving me crazy! I can find a comfortable position in bed and just start to doze off, then BAM my mind snaps to some thought and the wheels start up.
Signal	I used see a family doctor that prescribed my usual medications, including adderall, clonazepam, hydroxyzine, alprazolam, gabapentin, remeron, and recently, triazolam. All of these (except adderall) are prescribed to help me sleep. I have so many different ones because I don't like to rely on one medication and develop a tolerance. So I cycle them and I only take something for sleep 2-3 times a week. We have had discussions about his concern prescribing me all of these (they've never all been prescribed or refilled at the same time) and to not take them together, which I don't. We've developed trust between each other and that's why he still prescribes them. Needless to say, these prescriptions last me a LONG time. Late, last year, I started going to a psychiatrist for my anxiety and in hopes to get my prescriptions from him instead. This is mostly due to that the drive to see my family doctor that sometimes takes up to two hours. I was doing fine with my this psychiatrist (an intern at a university medical group). He was refilling the meds my family doctor was giving me and although he also had concerns, we also talked about them and he wanted me to stop getting scripts for me than 2 benzos even though I wasn't taking them very often, and I was fine with that.Flash forward to a necessary check up with my family doctor. Since I was there, I got refills for the streak and the triazolam. Obviously, my first mistake. When I went to fill the adderall, the pharmacy freaked out and called both my family doctor and the psychiatrist, even though I was due for an adderall refill anyways. By this time, my psychiatrist graduated and I was set to see a new intern.On my first visit with this new intern, he looked at my prescription drug record online and pretty much accused me of selling drugs because I got them from two providers. Yes, I understand how that looks, but he then pretty much said he's not going to give me prescriptions for anything, except my antidepressant (sertraline) and propanalol, and that I can't get prescriptions from my family doctor anymore. He doesn't want me on any of my previous prescriptions for sleep even though I took and one kind maybe 2-3 times a month, max. He said he was concerned about addiction, which I literally do everything to not get to that point and have never come close, and that it's possible I'm selling them.I understand he's an intern and trying to be super safe but I don't agree with this. I have a refill of one benzo and remeron from my family doctor, but know if I refill them, this new psychiatrist will know. I'm not sure what to do. I fear that is I go to a different psychiatrist, they will also check my online prescription record as a new patient and know I was going to a psychiatrist before even if I don't tell them. Obviously, if I went to a new psychiatrist, I wouldn't want to tell them about my old one because they'll want the records. I suppose I could just keep going to my family doctor for all of my prescriptions, but it's such a hassle with the distance. I guess my very long-winded question is if I find a new psychiatrist, is it normal for them to look at online prescription records like this intern did?
Signal	First time on this subreddit, writing this as I woke up yesterday at 16:00 and skipped a night's sleep to 'reset' my sleep pattern. It's 02:45 now and I still can't sleep.It's not the first time, actually I've been having an incredibly hard time falling asleep before 04:00-05:00. I've tried to reset like this before, reasoning that if I skip a night, I'll be exhausted enough next evening to sleep on time and wake up in time and like so resetting my sleeping pattern. It's not working and at this point I'm not sure what will.I've been a night owl for a long time. I love the quiet of the night, the lack of responsibilities, no need to deal with anything. Like my time is really mine to spend as I want.I'm 29, I suffer from low self esteem, tend to be depressive and apathetic. I'm in therapy and have used meds earlier this year, cipralex and later wellbutrin. I've not really had much success with them though. Notably, after I missed a few weeks of the latter and went back on them, my ability to sleep at a reasonable time deteriorated incredibly. After I then quit (after consulting my psychiatrist, not on my own accord), it seemed for a few days like I could sleep better but it deteriorated back to where I am now. I don't know much about insomnia and I don't know if my case even counts as such, but I figured that you guys might know more and have some tips to help me solve this, or at least cope.I'm lost here and this situation is harming my ability to get back to work or be productive in general and my marriage.
NotSignal	Looking for creative ideas for when you haven't been able to sleep and the negative thoughts rush in and I become hyper aware that I am not sleeping, which prevents me from sleeping. I feel like once this starts happening I am sunk for the night and getting up and doing something else hasn't worked either. Thanks!
Signal	I've been struggling with insomnia and depression for a while. I started with Melatonin last month along with depression and anxiety meds. While initially when I started with Melatonin, my sleep cycle was at least 5-6 hours without a break, as of this week I don't think that's effective on most days. On the days I do manage to sleep for 5-6 hours, I'm having vivid nightmares, to the point, that my nightmare today, made me actually leap out of the bed in my sleep and hit the ground (Hello, swollen forehead and bruised knee). The vivid dream was based in the same surrounding I was sleeping in, and I was being attacked, and hence I thought, I was awake. I've had similar nightmares ( minus the actual physical injuries) these last few days.I started taken Melatonin because I was not able to sleep for almost 30 hours at a go at times ( barely managed to sleep for 2-3 at a go if I did sleep)
Signal	Every night to help me sleep I take Trazodone, but I've noticed that it gives me pounding headaches, which makes it hard to sleep. I've been taking ibuprofen but I know I can't keep doing this every night because it's already making my stomach hurt. Is there any way that anyone knows to stop this? Is it a common symptom?
Signal	My states super locked down and I don’t have a PC anyway but I can’t do this sleepless night shit anymore. Was up till 4:30 last night took zzzquil which barely works anymore and fell asleep at 7. It noon so I got some sleep but have a full day planned. I don’t mind paying for the doctor or prescription but I need something stronger than zzzquil. I can’t do this shit anymore
Signal	I used to fall asleep at like 8-9 am (my whole life had collapsed so I just slept during the day and sat up during the night.) Well, now, 2 years later, things have gotten a lot better. I take sleeping pills and sleep with ear plugs, so usually I manage to fall asleep at about 2 am and get about 5-6 hours of sleep. My boyfriend of 2 years is totally ignorant about my condition, though. When he wakes up at night to take a piss, he fucking steps on me and turns on all the lights. He's rude and unaware of stuff when he's sleep. So when I wake up, I can't fall asleep again. And he snaps at me when I remind him for the 100th time to be careful not to wake me up when he need to go to the toilet. When I manage to fall asleep earlier, he steps on me just a few hours after I've fallen asleep so I have woken up at 1am sometimes just to spend the rest of the night depressingly scrolling on reddit. I go to university so my lack of sleep might affect my performance.Woke up at half past 2 tonight when he stepped on me again. Thankfully I don't have any classes today. Just wanted to rant. I'm sad and angry.
Signal	I have been dealing with insomnia for many years. Over the years it's gotten worse. After a long time using over-the-counter sleep medications and the dose ever-increasing I finally consulted a doctor. I was giving restoril at the dose of 7.5 mg and being that it didn't work the doctor immediately assumed I was drug-seeking after many long conversations and pleads I finally got my dose raised to 30 mg now after only a few days 30mg is no longer working I have complied with their pill counts weekly which is embarrassing on its own I don't know how to explain to them that things just aren't getting better. I have a sleep study schedule for next week and hope that maybe they will better understand. Dealing with no sleep daily affects every aspect of my life.is there any advice medication recommendations or anybody dealing with the same issues I would appreciate the feedback
Signal	Waking up from a micronap with my head bleeding, my table upside down and my front door pane glass smashed. Stuck in a thought loop for over an hour because my brain literally stopped processing words.It's 3AM, almost 4 days in and I'm wide awake. I'll doze off for a minute or two and snap back into it.The auditory hallucinations are still minor but I've been seeing things out of the corner of my eyes a lot.I want to die because I feel like that's the only way to sleep.
NotSignal	It’s been a long, cold, day in Scotland. What we call ‘dreich’. Tonight’s special is poppy seed bagel drizzled with garlic olive oil, but.... We’re gonna add some mozzarella! Bang it back under the grill, wee rocket salad....The jalapeños are optional!For the vegans I have a finely chopped medley, perhaps some courgettes. Come in!Sit down. I’m listening to ‘The Hounds of Love’ album.
Signal	I had melatonin for insomnia for about a year and half ( like , 4-5 times a week ). Following it , suddenly I developed symptoms of low T ( at age 34 ) and was diagnosed of secondary hypogonadism. Do you think if melatonin had some role in it ? Didn’t find scientific evidence though .
NotSignal	I've always had trouble falling asleep - it would always take me over an hour to fall asleep. But lately it's just got progressively worse. I had one insomniac night where I didn't sleep until 7am, and of course that led to me sleeping in ridiculously late, which has obviously fucked what little I had of a sleep schedule. Well, the last few nights I've been barely managing to fall asleep around 4/5, but it's got to 6am this time and I'm like... Do I just pull an all nighter and ride it out and attempt to do a hard reset? Do I keep attempting to fall asleep and get at least a couple of hours? Do I wait until I finally sleep and get 8 hours no matter how late into the day it gets? I don't know if I'd call myself an insomniac per say, but I'd guess in having an insomniac bout? I don't know. I'm just frustrated and very, very tired. I'm a night owl, but not to this degree xDI guess I'm just asking for advice? Anyone got any tips on how I could fix this?
Signal	I wake up in the middle of the night head pressure loose my hearing, heart racing and sweating like crazy. I feel like it’s nocturnal panic attacks. I’ve been tested for sleep apnea and I don’t have this during an “apnea” episode.
NotSignal	So I haven't been sleeping properly in the last few days. I stay in bed for hours and when I finally fall asleep it's not continuous. I keep waking up every hour/two hours which is so annoying. I honestly don't know why this is happening. I usually just listen to ASMR if I have a difficult time sleeping. Can anyone help me out?
Signal	Just wanted to share what worked for me with my insomnia. I was having massive anxiety that only started when I laid down to go to bed. It would cause my heart to beat so fast, and give me a lot of energy. I didn’t sleep for more than an hour a night for almost 2 weeks. I had gone to urgent care multiple times, and the ER. Xanax didn’t work, Seroquel didn’t work, and neither did trazodone. Eventually I got a general practitioner and she prescribed me hydroxyzine 50MG. Finally that worked. It allowed me to have full sleep, but it did give me a massive haze the next day. Eventually I weaned myself off it and took less and less. Now, I only have a day here and there that I can’t sleep. But the feeling that you KNOW you can over come your insomnia is really relaxing. Don’t ever give up, and just remember. You CAN over come insomnia. That thought alone may help somePeople.
NotSignal	99.5% of the time I sleep just fine. It’s that remaining 0.5% that is ruining some of the most enjoyable or important days in my life. The night before big life events or even just hectic days, I get too much anxiety or excitement to sleep. I don’t sleep a single wink and lie awake in frustration all night. It is really upsetting because some of the best days of my life, like my wedding, have been overshadowed by the extreme fatigue I felt because I didn’t sleep the night before. For example, I didn’t sleep the night before: my best friends wedding, my brothers wedding, my wedding, my bachelorette party, my professional engineering exam (like a bar for lawyers or boards for doctors), my college graduation, most Christmases, most thanksgivings, and the nights before leaving for a big vacation. I get so frustrated and will pop multiple sleeping pills throughout the night to the point where it’s getting unhealthy. I popped 4 over the counter sleeping pills the night before my wedding and didn’t sleep a wink. Melatonin doesn’t help either. Neither does NyQuil or Benadryl. I’m beginning to think I need a serious anti anxiety medication rather than sleeping pills because the anxiety/adrenaline far outweighs any tranquilizing effects I’ve experienced with sleep aids. I’m at such a loss of what to do and I’m not sure who to see about it. A psychiatrist? Sleep disorder specialist? I’m just so sick of my insomnia taking over my life and ruining some of the best days I could have had.
Signal	I follow all the basic sleep hygiene and consistent sleep schedule stuff, I've tested negative for sleep apnea and uars, hypothyroidism, any deficiencies, I exercise a lot during the day and eat a varied nutritionally balanced whole food plant based diet, etc. My issue is now it went from going days of no sleep last year to fragmented sleep to, an actual solid chunk of 5 and a half hours but now I dont recall dreams and feel like the sleep was very light because a few hours later I'm completely exhausted yawning, dizzy, lightheaded, extremely forgetful I find myself taking out a bunch of glasses for water and forgetting I already took a glass out. I say it a lot but it's very much a calm sedated/drunk feeling despite not doing drugs and havent had alcohol in years. I'm wondering if anyone was or is in a similar boat and what they've done to not only increase their length of sleep but their quality as well. I have a sleep study but it was unfortunately postponed so I cant rule out any other sleeping disorders. I'm not too worried because I know I'm getting sleep just wish it was better quality hah.
NotSignal	Im paranoid about being woken up, I just want to sleep an entire day without anybody waking me up. How do I loose this fear? I neef help asap. I havent slept in 5 days in a row. I feel like about to faint
NotSignal	I've always had trouble getting to sleep but I recently had surgery and since then my insomnia has kicked up to eleven.Ugh.I want to sleep. I am tired. I like sleeping!But instead I just lay here, rolling around every few minutes. I try to clear my mind. I try to think about boring things. I count sheep. I try to think about complicated things.I just want sleep, damnit.
Signal	Does anyone have anything effective to help with falling asleep? I guess if we did, we wouldn't be here. . 2 hrs for the past 3 nights. Medication is not working. I just lay here. Please don't tell me CBT/ relaxation techniques unless you have something truly unique.
NotSignal	Does anyone else fall asleep fairly easily when they lay down during the day but not a chance when they lay down in bed for the night? I try not to nap close to bedtime but it's frustrating how easy it is to fall asleep during the day and so evasive sleep is at night.Now that I'm typing this out, I wonder if my sleep maintenance insomnia has to do with me taking naps and getting used to shorter sleep periods.
Signal	I've always struggled to get to sleep, it takes me a good 4 hours to get settled and if I'm disturbed once during that time I have to start again. I here a noise, I need the bathroom, I get an inch, that's another few hours lying in bed trying to shut my head up for long enough to sleep. This results in maybe 4 hours of sleep a night - regardless of how little sleep I get, I always seem to wake up at 8amMy main issue comes from the all nighters I end up with, it's looking like I'm gonna have another one tonight. At least once a week, I'll be so physically and mentally drained that I just want to sleep all day, but I'll put it off until I actually go bed so that I can actually sleep, but that's my issue, I'm too tired to sleep. I just lie in bed, tossing and turning all nightIve tried typical sleep techniques, my bedroom is only used for sleep, if I can't sleep then I get up, do something until I'm ready to sleep and go back to my room. I try to limit screen time late at night, I don't drink caffeine 4 hours before I go to bed etc etc etc. I've tried reading, I'm trying meditation, I even changed my medication a few months back, so that is has a sedative mixed in with it but that doesn't help eitherI hate being in a haze all the time. My days blur into one, I can't remember what day of the week it is, I struggle to focus on basic tasks, I never have the energy to do anything. I don't know what else I can do to get myself more than a handful of hours a night, I just want a good night's rest I used to rely heavily on alcohol to help me sleep, among other things. I spent a good 2 years drunk, spent hundreds on pounds a month on alcohol and I'd wake up still drunk from the night before. I've since stopped drinking, I'm over 600 days sober and I hoped it would help me sleep having a natural body clock again, rather than falling asleep where I fell, but it hasn't. If anything I think it's made it worse. At least when I was drunk I'd actually get an 8 hour sleepI dunno anyway, this has gotten fairly long so I'm gonna leave it there. Maybe I'll try yet another sleep meditation and see if this one works
NotSignal	I was diagnosed with IBS and GERD a few years ago. Despite going to doctors, getting tests done, changing my diet and other treatments nothing has really had much of an impact on my IBS symptoms other than just trying to avoid major trigger foods. I don’t really have any safe foods though. Everything I eat causes me some level of discomfort.If I am not super careful about what I eat, how much I eat, and when I eat throughout the day I will experience a lot of discomfort in my bowel that makes me very restless and affects my sleep. I get restless legs also. It seems like sugar in particular makes me feel hot and restless when I’m trying to sleep.Is this the case for anyone else? Anything that has helped you?
NotSignal	So been using sleep restriction and slowly weaned my way back to a reasonable bedtime of 1130. Then I noticed my app has been recording me snoring for an hour sometimes up to two hours. I lifted the base of my bed up and now I no longer snore but have woken up at weird times or feeling lethargic.Did my body get used to snoring? Anyone else have this problem where their body doesnt know what to do now it doesnt snore?
Signal	Been struggling to sleep solid. Tried CPAP. Stopped taking Klonopin because I prefer to sleep naturally. Wife said I should try an Ambien so here goes....zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Signal	I had an important business trip today and I got literally no sleep last night. Just lying in my bed unable to sleep from 11PM until 5AM. Come 5AM, the birds start chirping and the sun is peeking through. I was so frustrated that I got up, made breakfast, put on my suit and laid down on the couch to wait until it was time to go. When I laid down, I immediately fell asleep and woke up an hour later to my alarm. Throughout the trip I was completely groggy and dozing off into sleep but now that it’s evening, I’m unable to sleep again! Has anyone else experienced this paradoxical hell?
Signal	First things I have minor insomnia not as bad as most people here. My problem is that once I lay down to sleep I can’t lol it last for 2 hours or so then I sleep.Is this just my internal clock?Any advice on how to sleep faster?
Signal	I am feeling so tired after days of insomnia and I just wish I could shutdown and feel nothing and loose myself into the void. Do you guys have an emergency solution to shut the brain down and plunge into the dark?
NotSignal	In the past six days I’ve had 7 hours of sleep and most of that was today from passing out at around 2:30pm yesterday. What would the er do if I phoned them up?
NotSignal	I was wondering if anybody else has this where you are but you can’t sleep, I know this is probably a stupid question but here I am.
Signal	I’ve suffered from Paradoxical insomnia for the past 9 months and tried everything from sleep pills, bed time rituals, sleep restriction, stimulus control and nothing helped me fall asleep. I decided to try the app bc I was desperate and what did I have to lose besides more sleep. To my surprise after going through a couple sleep trials I in fact was falling asleep but bc I’ve had so much anxiety and hyper arousal built up when it came to laying in bed I just felt awake at all times. This literally is a godsend app and I’m finally making a breakthrough!
NotSignal	Does sleeping earlier or later affect your sleep quality? ie; going to sleep at 12 and waking up at 8 vs going to sleep at 10 and waking up at 6.Im hoping this isn’t a coincidence that last night going to sleep earlier made me sleep better than i have in months (didn’t wake up at all during the night)
Signal	I recently started taking melatonin (1mg an hour before bed), and I always end up waking up too early, like after 5 hours. I don’t get a full 8 hours of sleep like I usually do. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you overcome it?
Signal	I've always had terrible insomnia, in periods getting 0-3 hours of sleep at night, and while I'm a light sleeper, I can sleep through 10 alarms. Someone walking past my door? I wake up. A little light get into my room? I wake up. Someone closing a car door down the street? I wake up.My different alarms blasting straight into my ear? I litterally sleep right through it.It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to fall asleep, if I know I have to get up in an hour or two, because I'm afraid I'll oversleep, which is something that's happened a lot during my life. This in turn makes me exhausted during the day, and thus more anxious, making it hard for me to sleep, which puts me in the 'afraid to fall asleep'-phase again. I don't know what to do...Sorry if this is incoherent, I've slept a combined amount of 3 hours the last 40 hours, divided into 30-60 minute naps, I'm desperate at this point.
NotSignal	Hey I found myself sleeping ok at 2 am, now tried 3 am and it was worse, didn't sleep for 5 weeks well at all, should I go back to 2 am?
Signal	This is not a throwaway. Im just a long time lurker and this is all I could think of. I do have insomnia, to be specific, I was diagnosed with idiopathic hyposomnia. As I get closer to my 30's, I've come to learn that it has lest to do with intrusive thoughts and a wandering mind, and more to do with struggling to call it a night. I have many things I need to catch up on, things centered around my education, career, side hustle, being a father of a toddler, exercise, etc. &#x200B;It's gotten to the point where I'm picking up extra shifts at work, strapping on a backpack, ankle weights, etc, and loading it with 30+ pounds, and then going for a run/jog in the desert to try and satiate my desire to push myself. As I'm talking right now, I'm 14 days straight into work, finished a 12 hour shift on my day off, and hiked 10 miles yet I still can't find sleep. I'll drink, smoke weed, and physically push myself to exhaustion yet everytime I think about sleeping, I cut myself off with a "but you can keep going." I can't find a stopping point. I know a lot of people would love to be able to have the capacity to run full cylinder for months on end without burn out, but I do need to find my peace. I wish that I could go to bed normally and wake up normally, but instead, my body, mind, and spirit, refuse to shut the fuck up and let me relax. I miss the feeling of laying down, feeling like I've led a complete day. Instead, I just never feel like the day is finished.
NotSignal	I’ve been up for 36 hours. I’ve been tired all day and just wanting to go to bed. Now that it is time to go to bed, I’m not tired at all. I just want to be able to sleep.
NotSignal	Hi everyone, I make fantastic sounds for sleeping, if you would like me to make a sound what makes you fall asleep subscribe to my YouTube channel & send me a message and I'll try my best :). I need all the support I can so please feel free to click the link below and subscribe ♥️
Signal	Go to bed at 12am close my eyes toss and turn for eternity then it says 3am then struggle being up every hour wow this is insane it's been like this for a few weeks. Maybe getting 3 hours tops a night and yawning and being sleepy all day. Soooooo much fun
Signal	Throwaway, sorry. I need to vent/ask advice, and I don't think I've seen such a group of other people like me before. I've suffered from insomnia since I was a child. It's always been up and down for me, sometimes I'll go months sleeping like a rock, but other times, like now, I can stay up until 4/5am before passing out for two hours, and that'll be the running theme for half the year. Weed helps. It helps me get to sleep and failing that, nullifies all of my anxiety. But, see, also, unfortunately for me, I also have PPD and a fair bit of delusions. Every time I have a bad bit of insomnia though, I feel like I have fatal familial insomnia. I dread that I'll never be able to sleep again, and that I'll die like this- which, as you can expect, makes it..all the more harder to sleep, which just sends me into a hellish positive feedback loop. Any advice for getting to sleep when you brain wants to just self destruct?
NotSignal	It’s currently 6:30am here, I’ve tried sleeping all night but my minds racing and I no longer feel tired. I tried sitting up to medication, but then suddenly I felt waves of panic hit me out of no where when I tried to focus on my breathing and my heart rate started going up along with intense sweat and fear. There was nothing on my mind that could of triggered me, that I know of at least, and my anxiety was very manageable today. Could lack of sleep cause panic attacks?
NotSignal	That you're scared to go to sleep cause you're scared its gonna hurt? Your body is so tired its aching. Its weird, wonder if anyone knows what i mean.
NotSignal	Hi ,Has anyone had any luck dealing with this. I struggle with sleep quality due to hyperarousal which leaves me completely wrecked during the day.Have done sleep studies, seen doctors, melatonin,Seroquel, practice sleep hygiene, nothing helps consistently.Thank you
NotSignal	I didn't feel good last night and tried so hard to go to sleep early. I felt so run down and I still couldn't sleep. It's like the conditions have to be perfect for anything to happen. I have to switch sides like 20 times, make endless minor adjustments to the position I'm in,; It feels like all of a sudden I'm covered in poison ivy and must scratch everywhere; I must have my blanket completely covering me, no bunching anywhere, no skin touching skin; Its gotta be cold but if it's too cold, I'll have to get up to go to the bathroom more; My eyes will flutter open so the tiniest bit of light is unacceptable; my hair must be pulled back and not under my head; gotta have a podcast going to focus on or else my mind will wander and make it impossible to sleep... Even if I manage to get comfortable, it still takes forever to sleep. Even at 3, 4, 5 in the morning It takes a lot of effort to fall asleep. My favorite feeling in the world not being able to keep my eyes open and I feel it so rarely. My doctor put me on trazadone to help me sleep and I feel like it does nothing. I did a sleep study and I couldn't fall asleep on their orders. Their answer was you never actually entered REM sleep so we can't help you. I see how easy it is for my husband to fall asleep and I'm jealous. I just want to be able to sleep like a normal person.
Signal	I don't think I've ever been like this. I used to stay up late cos of the internet but once I close my laptop I fall asleep within 10-20mins.Ever since 2 nights ago, I just can't seem to fall asleep properly. I literally tried for 4-6 hrs each night with my eyes closed. I just feel super uncomfortable no matter what position I'm in and I'm literally tossing and turning the entire time. It's terrible and I get so tired cos I just wanna sleep but I can't, to the point that I want to cry already. Then suddenly I do get to fall asleep but it's around 4-5 am already.Could it be due to the stress I've been dealing with this week? I've been having anxiety about my responsibilities and been feeling a lot of pressure lately, esp cos of the quarantine and the virus.
NotSignal	so i’m a college student, and developed what i assumed was some sort of stress-induced insomnia last semester. i went home for winter break, then went on a ski trip and had very minimal issues. i’ve been back at my apt at school for a few days and have had issues the past 3/4 nights. the weird thing is though, classes haven’t started for me and i don’t really feel stressed at all? i was thinking maybe it’s my bed, but i’ve never had issues with it in the past.thoughts? anyone experience something similar?
Signal	Recently I've started to have insomnia.I'll try going to bed around 10pm and next thing I know I'm watching the sun come up and I didn't sleep at all. Then I have to get ready for work in a cranky mood. In the past this was due to anxiety. Recently even on good day when I'm exhausted I just stay up. I took melatonin last night and knocked out. Took it this evening and nothing. Back to square one. I don't know what gives but I'm so frustrated.
NotSignal	I havent had one yet for about a day or two but about 4 days out of this week (in a row) I had a nightmare every night. Im scared to sleep now. One of the dreams were bad that I accidently made myself have a mussle spasm in my leg. I even couldn't walk for a bit bc it hurt so bad. Its currently almost 4 am and i think this is me venting. Should probably get some sleep now.
NotSignal	Hey guys, new poster here. For me, It’s the perfect paradoxical storm i create for myself. I want so badly to sleep, i know I’m trying/thinking too hard about falling asleep to achieve it and this goes on for days until I cannot function anymore without rest. I go 3-9 DAYS like this. It truely feels like my brain forgets how to turn off. And it’s ruining my life.
Signal	I have Bronchitis and I’m getting better but the problem now is that I can’t sleep. I haven’t slept good in almost 3 days. I only sleep a few minutes then wake up. The most sleep I’ve had is probably 2 hours. I’m really tired and my eyes start closing. I lay down and feel myself starting to fall asleep but as soon as I do it’s like my mind says, “Ha! Sike!” I already called the doctor and she said she can’t do anything about it. She also told me to take A LOT of Melatonin and 50mg of benadryl. I asked her how much is a lot but she didn’t really answer lol. Any tips on what I should do to get some sleep? I’m really exhausted and I’ve been telling my friends that if I die, I’ll probably die because of sleep deprivation and not from Bronchitis/influenza/bronchospasm that I’m currently trying to heal from. 😩I hope everyone is safe and having a nice day. Whether you’re stuck at home bored, working from home, or those people who still have to go to work. Blessings to everyone! 😊🙏🏽
NotSignal	I’ve been late every single day to anywhere I needed to be since January. Any tips or advice on how to help my insomnia or even managing time in general.
Signal	Hi guysI’ve been suffering from insomnia on and off for about 12 years. I’ve tried CBT to no avail, and the end goal is to get me an actual diagnosis for whatever disorder I’m experiencing mentally and medicate me for that(they think the insomnia is a symptom rather than a stand-alone thing), but in the mean time I’ve been prescribed zopiclone. My doctor and psychiatrist said to take half a pill which is 3.75mg and go up to the full 7.5 if that doesn’t work. I’ve taken 3.75 for the past 2 nights and haven’t slept til 7-8 hours after taking it, I’ve just ended up lying in bed badly depressed, and I wake up the next day groggy and still quite depressed. My doctors explained side effects to me, and said that depression is possible, so if I ask them I’m sure they’ll just tell me to up the dose regardless and if I get any negative feelings they’ll go away once I settle into it. I want to try it but I’m afraid it won’t actually make me sleep and I’ll just be even more depressed. What do you guys think?
NotSignal	Fuck everything about this. I was doing well until very recently and now I'm back to not being able to sleep. Every time I begin to relax, my body starts pumping me with stress hormones, as if to mock me. I hate this. I hate everything about this...
NotSignal	Woke up at 3pm after falling asleep sitting in a chair. Slept for about 4 hours after being up for about 48. Definitely gonna be an all nighter. I hate how quiet and lonely nights are when I can't sleep.
Signal	Mimosa Pudica - go search on google It’s a fucking small plant that its leaves close whenever something touches it. The story: So my mom and i are fucking tired of finding something that makes me sleep; OTC drugs like benadryl is not as potent as before and I don’t wanna be dependent on benzos. One day my auntie recommends me of drinking this grass like a tea. And I’m so fucking glad that it cured my depression and insomnia, no bullshit. How to make the Mimosa Pudica Tea:Step 1- after gathering Mimosa Pudica, wash them thoroughly. Okay? They are like grass and you don’t wanna drink the soil lol 😂.Step 2- boil it in the water for 20 min. Step 3- let it cool, you don’t wanna burn your mouth it still hot. 🥵Step 4- drink 2 glass per night. Step 5- try to sleep (you may not be able to sleep immediately this is not magic. You should wait hours and hours closing your eyes and 😌 relaxing) The depression and my insomnia goes awayNo bullshit guys. I looked up on google and it has anti-depressant benefits. This may not work for everyone here but this works for me. Im not sure on this plant’s availability in your country but if you have, if you can find them, then give it a try.
NotSignal	Hey all, first time poster here. I've been suffering some form of insomnia on and off for the past 7 years. It all started I think when we moved to a new location, a new job which I hated. I think I blame the job as I was pretty depressed and stressed. I started having trouble getting to and staying asleep. I started a new job 2 years ago which I love and the sleep did seem to improve. But lately it's getting worse again. What I notice is I fall asleep pretty easily usually but only after a few minutes I wake up with like a shock and feel all panicked. Heart rate even feels fast. Sometimes feel like I'm almost vibrating it's weird. Once that happens I really struggle to get back to sleep for hours. This happens probably every second night on average. The other thing is if I ever have an alarm clock set for the morning I just know this will trigger me and I'll not sleep. Most the time I don't need an alarm but can be super stressful if I do, as I know I won't sleep that night. I'm not sure if there is some trauma in working a shit job and having an alarm for that for years. But even without an alarm I still get that weird thing where I sleep for a few mins then wake up, so not confident it's that either. I do find if this happens and I go to another room in the house and sleep alone it's often better. Having my partner beside me seems to make it worse for some reason. Knowing they are asleep just seems to make it all the worse. Any ideas? Really sick of being tired. Thanks!
Signal	Hi there. Nearly every night for the past month or so I have fallen asleep at lets say 12am and then woken up at 12:30, feeling anxious, stressed and not recognising my life, having a bit of an out of body experience. It always happens 10-30 minutes after I fall asleep. I am too exhausted to even check my phone when I wake up like this, so I go to sleep around 30-60 minutes later, and sleep fine after that. This has been happening every night, same pattern of sleeping, waking up anxious, falling asleep and waking up the next morning feeling OK- not well rested, but ok. I am thinking of going to the doctors about this but I’m not sure what to tell them and how they can help. If anyone has any advice or experience with this I’d greatly appreciated. Thank you all xx
NotSignal	I can’t go to sleep and when I do fall asleep, hypnic jerk keeps me awake! What can I do? I tried sleeping app but it doesn’t work.
Signal	Anyone have success with Unisom? I’ve tried a number of other sleep aids (otc) and vitamins/supplements but not much has really helped. Going to pick up some Unisom today and hope it helps me sleep tonight 🤞🏻
NotSignal	So many nights that’s all I can think about and if anybody has a solution that would be very much appreciated :)
Signal	I took two melatonin pills (instead of my “usual” one) and still managed to wake up in the middle of the night? Lmk why that happened
Signal	as title says I have been suffering from poor insomnia for several months. I don’t know what is wrong with my brain atm but it just doesn’t let me sleep easily.I often spend 2-3 hours in a bizarre semi dream like state before I can finally go to sleep. In this state I have thoughts and stories that don’t rly make any sense and that I can never hold or remember much like a dream but I have several every minute and it goes on and on. I’ll be immersed in a story then seconds later forget what I was thinking about then back into another almost as if I am dreaming but I am awake. This goes on until I eventually fall asleep several hours later. It is horrible.I don’t know if I am explaining this well it’s a hard state to explain it almost feels like REM sleep while awake
Signal	Hello all,This is just kind of random but I am looking for any sleep advise. I am 29/m who honestly sleeps about an hour per evening if I’m lucky. I don’t really like taking medication to help (health issues) but It has been a three days with no sleep so any tips would help. Thanks
Signal	Why is this happening to me? I do everything right, soothing music, deep breathing, mindfulness and meditation, melatonin and trazodone, and yet I still just can't get any good sleep. I'm so upset I could cry. I just wanna be like everyone else.
Signal	I think I roll around in my bed more hours then I sleep. Like actually fuck me
Signal	I've been having an extremely difficult time sleeping lately even with consistent exercise, great nutrition, and 200mg of Trazodone. Hoping this might make someone laugh at my sleep deprived silliness ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
NotSignal	Seriously. I'm naturally a night owl and read some people genetically can't function during what most people would call normal business hours. Idk when it happened but I couldn't even try to get to bed until 3 am. Now it's almost 6 and I'm staring at the wall. I did some exercise, kickboxing, and yoga today to burn excess energy. Hell I did the same thing yesterday, got tired halfway into yoga, but the moment I get in bed all this energy from nowhere keeps me awake.
NotSignal	Last time I woke up it was super early but I couldn't get comfortable, I just kept tossing and turning, so I decided to just get up.I powered through the day and tried to sleep when I got tired, but the same thing happened. All. Night. What is going on?
Signal	No matter what I do or take I can’t fall asleep until late morning. I don’t have anxiety most of the time and yet it so takes forever. I’m at a breaking point with this. My insomnia has always been severe but lately I wake up every hour and only sleep for maybe 5 hours. I am enrolled in CBT but no luck after a couple of sessions. My labs will be drawn soon to see if it’s hormonal but that’ll be another couple of weeks because I have COVID. You would think with being sick my body would crash but it hasn’t. I bought blue light blocking glasses but no luck. I feel I’ve tried every med and supplement. I’m at my wits end and need any hope. This has been an issue all my life and gets worse as I get older which scares me. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.
Signal	Hey.. I was wondering if I have to tapper off trazodone to a lower dose or I can just quit? I took 50 mg for 1 month and 1 week.. now I fell like it gives me insomnia.. I May be wrong but still wana quit
Signal	Double, double toil and trouble;Meletonin but make it double.Really sick of stay up late,In the tumbler bounce and shake;Eyes all red and the minds a fog,2 pours gin half vermouth dropped,Use a fork and place the ice in keen,Blizzard's temp and I'll drunkly dream,For a drag of powerful trouble,Like a sleep-broth so I stumble.Double, double toil and trouble;Fire burn and caldron bubble.Cool it with a baboon's blood,Then the charm is firm and good.
Signal	Trying trazodone today and wanted to use the lowest dose that would help.
NotSignal	For years for about 3-5 days I can't get any sleep and if I do it is so restless I'm awake in 15 minutes. I don't drink caffeine my screen time is the same every day. And my stress level is always high. Any suggestions but up for 3 days now.
Signal	Im afraid of the dark to the point that sometimes im so scared i turn on my phone flashlight and use it to look around the room. I do that about every few minutes. I used to get at most 2-3 hours of sleep on a lucky night but because of my increasing fear sometimes i get no sleep at all. Is this normal?
Signal	so i've been on 150mg of trazodone for 2 years, and can't afford to pay off my psychiatrist bill, therefore can't make another appointment. so now, nobody will refill my prescriptions so i'm going to have to go cold turkey. i already know that i'm not going to be sleeping for a few nights, based on experiences from times i've run out of my script. aside from that, what withdrawals symptoms should i expect? and does anyone have any experiences with what could help me out during withdrawals? i'm still withdrawing from having to quit buspar cold turkey too, so i'm sure this will all be a swell fuckin treat lol. any help or advice is greatly appreciated
NotSignal	It’s been months since I’ve gotten 6 hours of sleep, I shit you not. These days my whole body feels weak, I feel like it’s hard to breathe, and I feel like I’m destroying my brain and body. I have no clue when I’ll get this under control but I’m so afraid I’ve cause irreversible damage at this point and I was wondering if it would be possible to one day reverse all of this if I can finally get back on track. I feel like my body is reaching a point where it can’t do this anymore. Been averaging 4-5 hours a night since December. This is a nightmare :(
Signal	I feel dead if I dont have caffeine but if I drink any coffee at all I am awake until like 11 PM or later most nights.I hate it. I just want to get the sleep I need to function like a normal human. I have a deviated septum which is yet to be fixed until later this month and then if I still have sleep issues they will let me do a sleep study.My lack of energy and bad mood is causing problems in my marriage.Not looking for help or sympathy guess I just wanted to rant.
Signal	Hi, I’ve dealt with insomnia since my early teen years and have mostly gotten it under control. I have to be in control of my environment and have a couple noice machines and take hydroxyzine. So I’ve been okay until last week when I started having the same muscles twitch in my legs and feet every night. There’s a muscle deep in the center of my foot that twitches all night as a couple in my calves and thighs that twitch on an off. I’ve stretched and have had plenty of water and rub the muscles to no avail. The twitching seems out of my control and I can’t sleep because I can feel it happening and can’t stop it. Has anyone else experienced this? And has anyone else found a way to deal or get rid of it?
Signal	Hey, I always struggled with falling asleep but lately it’s getting worse, I takes me many hours before I can fall asleep. The biggest problem of mine is when I’m trying to lay down and chill I start to quickly shift my attention towards my heartbeat and my breath and I become really anxious. My muscles tend to twitch too, especially my legs. When I focus too much on my heart I immediately start to sweat and my breath quickens. Any help guys? Does anyone have symptoms like that?
Signal	I am 20 years old, have had insomnia since birth, I am contracted to a certain job until November and I've been there for over a year, but for the past month insomnia has hit me really hard, probably the hardest I've ever been hit with it ever.I am autistic and I also have anxiety that can get really bad sometimes, and work has got really difficult due to physical injuries and social difficulties, as a result and due to my rising levels of anxiety, my insomnia returned in its most destructive version yet, I can only fall asleep at 3 am and when I wake up at 6 am I immediately go back to bed as an instinct, eventually fall asleep and then wake up at 9-10am with lots of angry messages from my boss (who doesnt know what insomnia is nor does he understand that its not easy to stop it from affecting you), I am ordered to go to the workplace and not only am I tired, but I become depressed, a bit moody and I feel worthless like a piece of trash.I have 2 more months until my contract is over and I am really worried of losing it because its my only chance of ever getting a job I like (where I live, employers dont like working with autism), so I hope I find a way to get another job if I end up losing it...I just wanted to write this down, maybe it will help others who relate, maybe it'll help me, but I mainly just wanted to vent out some of my feelings.
NotSignal	Just spent 3 hours on the couch trying to take a nap. My mind just won't let me go. I'm starting to become more and more frustrated with myself. My body feels fucking dead and my ears just won't stop ringing. I really don't want to live like this anymore.
Signal	So i (21F) use to have fairly bad insomnia back in high school to the point I'd either just not sleep before classes or fall asleep in the very early hours of the AM and the little sleep id get would be disturbed by constantly waking up. After high school it was not as consistent and happened maybe one or two times every month, however, the last few months it has started creeping back into my life more consistently again except this time my symptoms(?) are a bit different then back in high school. Now I will be dead tired all day after work but the instant I go to lay down for bed (I can nap just fine, but I try not to so I have a better chance of sleeping at night) suddenly I feel more awake then ever so it takes me hours to fall asleep, eventually when I do sleep I find myself waking up covered in sweat (my room AC is turned down to 65 degrees so it's very cold in my room), this usually happens after about 1-2 hours of sleep and I CANNOT for the life of me go back to bed for another few hours because I feel too warm...by the time I fall back asleep it is nearly time for me to get back up for work. I can't take melatonin due to how it interferes with my birth control so I am wondering what else I can possibly start taking to help me sleep. Thank you!
NotSignal	I’m a teen who has absolutely no responsibilities at the moment. No school. No sports. No anything. For the first month of quarantine, I slept soundly, but I don’t know why I’m suddenly not able to fall asleep.I get into those states of half wakefulness where I’m kind of dreaming but not sleeping, and then I jerk back awake. It repeats in cycles and it’s been happening for 3 hours now. I feel awake like it’s not nighttime at all.I analyzed my day and I don’t know what makes it different from the other days. I just wanna sleep :(
NotSignal	I don’t know why I’m like this but even my dad brought it up awhile ago. I usually go to bed around 1-2 am and wake up at 4:30am and get ready. Last night I decided to get some sleep early and went to bed at around 11:30pm then slept through all my alarms and it took me hours to get going.Anyone else experience this?According to the Apple health and Fitbit apps, I averaged around 3 hours of sleep per night in the past year.
NotSignal	I apologize if this is the wrong place to post but does anyone have any tips on staying awake during the day after not getting much sleep during the night? I couldn’t sleep until after 4 last night and now am having to work about 12 hours today. I could use some advice...
NotSignal	I’ve recently started using this feature on iPhone for my insomnia (since I usually read on my phone before bed) and I’ve found it really helpful. I usually start feeling sleepy a lot earlier and find the warmer colours more relaxing. Don’t know if this will help anyone else, but we insomniacs need all the help we can get!
Signal	I’ve been struggling with insomnia (cannot sleep without unisom or melatonin) for about a year and haven’t been to the doctors yet. If I go to the doctors, will they be able to cure it?
Signal	I have very VERY bad insomnia and I've had it for a few years, I've tried sleeping pills and they worked for a little while but what happend was when they stopped (idk if I'm saying this correctly) I'd wake up and that'd usually be at about 3 or 2 am which made the whole thing a lot worse, it made me tried at school and not able to work. It got so bad that I just couldn't wake up when my mom tried to wake me for school and I missed a lot of classes and it sucks... I want to not be tired all the time and I hate this so much, I've had breakdowns where i just start crying and it's been very hard for me and my family. What I'm asking is for ppl who have had this all their lives (I'm 14 btw) does it get better?
Signal	I'm still committed to my break from cannabis even though it's now week 4 and clear that this isn't withdrawals but just my old insomnia getting to run wild again.After a few days of no-3 hours of sleep I give in and take a sleeping aid, usually a super strong antihistamine, but I find that even then, I wake up CONSTANTLY. Like 5 to 20 times throughout the night I'll try to wake up, be conscious for a few seconds, turn, and fall right back asleep.Is this common? Anyone else experience this?I feel like it has to be impacting the quality of my sleep and maybe even negating some of the purpose of taking a sleep aid.Any advice? I miss sleeping through the night, but as I said at the beginning of the post, I'm committed to my sobriety this month and would like to see it through.
NotSignal	and then once you’ve thought about it you feel like you’ll never fall asleep, because all you’re thinking about is not being able to sleep?
Signal	is there anyone who is taking trazodone for both insomnia and depression? I’m happy with my trazodone dosage to help with my sleep and im planning to get on antidepressants soon - I’m wondering if it would be more effective to just up the dosage of traz or if i should take something entirely different for depression. does anyone have any experience with this? thank you!
NotSignal	Say I fall asleep at 11 or 12 something, wake up at 3 or maybe 5 am, should I got for fractured sleep to make up time. My thought is that those could be considered naps and screw over my next lay down. Then I think, I should fall asleep to make up for lost time. When I do this, though, it feels like I need another 7 or 8 hours of sleep. Also, how are you guys offsetting the negative effects of poor sleep? I eat well and weightlift near daily, as that is as much as I can do right now. Sleep hygiene doesn't seem to make a difference. Whether I've done work and read in bed, or do this outside of my room. Some nights I'll not have looked at a screen before heading to bed and still wake up. Other nights I'll have looked at a flatscreen and get decent rest. Not sure what the hell's wrong with me. XD
Signal	first off, it’s been physically impossible for me to sleep more than 6 hours for like, a few weeks and the other night i took 5 valium. i honestly don’t know how my insomnia is this powerful. but even when i do sleep, i just cannot sleep deeply- i get weird hallucinations mixed with dreams, like half awake delirium and it’s driving me nuts. i’m starting antipsychotics (seroquel) soon which should help with my weird sleep psychosis and help me sleep but i have to wait a while for that. anyway, does anyone else experience the not being able to sleep deeply thing? like last night i had a realistic dream about someone i know dying and then woke up believing it had happened and almost acted on it, by messaging this dude and his friends to say like sorry for your loss when i’m fairly sure (but still not certain the next day, might be losing my mind) he’s alive? that was around 5am and i woke up fully after, sent a few texts about it and then was awake for the next hour and a half in a panic about it (good old insomnia) before actually managing to fall asleep again, but again, into a weird half awake state. i remember checking my phone at a certain time and seeing replies on it and being happy but i couldn’t unlock it for some reason so i gave up and chucked it across my bed (i was like half conscious i guess, i remember doing it, i was either retarded or asleep but either way, i did actually chuck my phone and remember doing it after not being able to unlock it but seeing replies to my panic). then i properly woke up about half an hour later, just to find that there weren’t any responses at the time i’d seen them as... normal people aren’t awake from 4-7am... whoops. either way, i feel like i’m going insane and when i do sleep i’m half conscious and not in control of my actions, the other night i fully screamed in my sleep/wake in this state, and i’m just freaking myself out. how can i sleep deeply and stop this weird shit, because if i keep getting psychotic shit like last night i will end up somehow damaging my life asking if people have died and bollocks. god, i cannot wait to start seroquel.. but until then, has anyone else experienced the weird half asleep half awake bullshit and how can i fix it?
NotSignal	Hi, I’m brand new here. My first post in this sub. I don’t have any diagnosis or anything because doctors are expensive in america, but I’m pretty sure I have pretty bad insomnia. I’ve tried silence, white noise, having a show on in the background, hot, cold, medicine, and a million other things. I’ve tried my bed, the floor, my car, the couch. All to no avail. I absolutely cannot get to sleep until I crash. I’m wide awake for roughly 18-22 hours, then it’s a drop off and I’m a zombie until I can go to bed, then I sleep hard for 6-10 hours. Countless times I’ve had to finish a shift at work drinking unhealthy amounts of caffeine. This is taking a major toll on my mental health. I’ve started having small nervous breakdowns because I’m scared that I won’t be able to sleep before I have to go to work. I would greatly appreciate any home remedies that don’t involve expensive doctors.
Signal	I'm an introvert by nature. I can't stand to be around people perpetually. I need my space. I'm also going through moderate depression and anxiety disorder. I've left my job and my medication for depression and sleep (melatonin) have not been very effective so I will discuss with the doctors and try other medications.On an average, I'm awake for 30 hours or so. It's exhausting to sleep and to be awake. I've had chronic insomnia for years. The last few months were worse though. However my best friend has been staying with me this week(she stays in the other end of the country) and I've been oddly able to sleep around 2-6 AM. A couple of weeks ago, I stayed over at another very good friend's place for the weekend, and the same thing happened.I have flatmates, but my room is my own. I'm not dating anyone. I'm just finding this a little odd, that, this is how I'm able to fall asleep since I usually like being on my own. I can't keep having people stay over all the time. Having a roommate like in college is not something I want to repeat. What do I do?
NotSignal	It might not work for everyone but it worked for me. I think my insomnia was on the tail end of moderate: barely able to sleep then when I did sleep it was fragmented and restless. 2 sprays before bed time and I actually sleep well. It's wonderful and part of my night routine now. If you haven't already tried this, I definitely recommend it.
NotSignal	It's been 2 days and still can't sleep and I can't take naps either, can someone give me advice? I just wanted some a goods night rest, why can't I sleep?
Signal	anyone else struggle with severe nighttime anxiety? i already have an anxiety disorder but at night i feel so frightened. like, my body knows it’s going to be another sleepless night full of worry. i must sleep with some sort of youtube video of someone talking or else i can’t sleep or i’m scared something bad will happen at night when i’m sleeping.
NotSignal	I cant ever fall asleep before 2-3 am. Very rarely do I fall asleep at a reasonable time. Ive been having insomnia for years for but it’s getting worse and worse. It’s 4:06 am right now and ive been tossing and turning in bed since 12:30am. I usually fall asleep around 3am and wake up at 6am, toss and turn for an hour then finally fall asleep till 12pm. My city is under lockdown so we’re all quarantined at home. My husband gets so upset that I wake up so late. He thinks I sleep 15 hours a night. He falls asleep very early and has no idea how I suffer at night trying to sleep. I want to cry. I just want to sleep like a normal person. 😔
Signal	I went through weeks of not sleeping, 1-2 hours a night. Then I slept great for a solid week and a half and now last night I didn't sleep again. I'm afraid and angry that it's going to start again. I can't go through this for another cycle, I just can't.I can't afford anymore doctor appointments, therapy doesn't help. Why can you do everything right and still fail at something that's supposed to be natural
Signal	I first lived in a stressful place where the early morning traffic outside would wake me up. A year of that was followed by two in a place with poor light insulation, then a bad memory foam mattress.I go to bed late so that’s something I should fix- but when I wake up at 7 or 8 with six or less hours of sleep, I’m unable to fall back asleep. I’m convinced that anxiety over not being able to sleep keeps me up. Any way to overcome this?
NotSignal	I have a messed up sleep schedule and I haven’t been out the house in a long time has made me sick. And also to add that I have online classes that are giving me stress.
Signal	This has always been a thing for me, and sleeping well during school is unimaginable. Luckily, with the coronavirus quarantine I had no specific times I had to be awake by, and deadlines were pressing but not as stressful because I was completely in charge of my schedule. I thought that I had actually gotten over insomnia as a result of sleeping pretty well for the past three months, but tomorrow (or well, later today) I have to wake up early to choose courses for my next school term which I'm somewhat dreading; so here I am, wide awake at 3am frustrated as to why this *thing*, which did worry me a little but not excruciatingly so, is keeping me up. Don't we all just love how our brain chooses to constantly think and think and think when there's really nothing to worry or stress about? I feel like I'm gaslighting my own brain LOL but I'm very frustrated. Yay, my next insomnia cycle is starting.
NotSignal	it’s almost 3am and i cannot sleep even tho i’m so tired. every time i close my eyes i see scary scary things what do i do??
Signal	It's been like this for a month. I tried not sleeping for a day so I can sleep well next day but ended up sleeping only 3 hours. I study and I work out but even if I'm completely exhausted I can't sleep more than 3 hours.Should I seek medical help?
Signal	I have lowish blood pressure. A year or so ago following a private health check up (not for any particular reason, just that I felt I was more breathless than I should be for my age 65) the results advised seeing my GP as my blood pressure was low. GP completely uninterested. I have had insomnia all of my life pretty nearly. I have been wondering if my pressure, or maybe pulse, or oxygen levels, are dropping when I'm asleep which is why I wake up feeling quite breathless and anxious. I wake up at 3 am and seldom get back to sleep without half a zopiclone, but still only sleep 2 hours more after a sleeping pill. I think that sleeping pills may contribute to low blood pressure, they knock you out but you wake once your BP drops. Anyone else think this might be contributing to their night waking? There is very little online about it, one study from 1991 # [Relationship Between Insomnia and Arterial Hypotension]I am having some success with breathing slightly deeper than normal on waking, just lying listening to audiobooks (passes the night) but breathing a bit more deeply. I drift off sometimes which is a breakthrough for me.
Signal	So I stopped Benadryl like two weeks ago I started using it in really high doses had little help. Honestly after stopping I feel better, It made me depressed and thoughts crazy. Now though I’m up all night later than usually, Usually I’m in bed by 1:30 now it’s 3 to 4...what should I do.
Signal	guys i cannot fall asleep and OH MY GOD i can barely breathe like i have to try so hard to breathe so i’m scared that if i accidentally fall asleep(which i won’t because i cant keep my eyes shut for more than a minute) i’ll DIE IN MY SLEEP? has this happened to anyone else and wtf should i do.
Signal	i will go to bed at 6-8 am and not wake up until 2-4 pm but i cannot force myself to get tired or sleep before then is my sleep schedule messed up or is it possible i have insomnia? i wake up multiple times throughout the night and i don't even remember the last time i got refreshing sleep sometimes ill get 10 hours of sleep and still be tired during the day it feels like torture
Signal	I've been struggling a lot with not being able to fall asleep lately (mostly being awake in bed till 4/5) because I get anxious and nervous by the second I'm going to bed. When I finally (after a lot of breathing exercises) I calm down a bit I suddenly feel the urge to pee. I can't just ignore it and so I have to get up and this cycle repeats at least 3 times every night and it's so annoying. Especially because I don't actually have to pee, my mind is making it up :( Anyone with me ? Any advice?
NotSignal	Do you ever just struggle to sleep but when you do you wake up like 3 hours in? I literally had this last night.
NotSignal	I've been doing a. lot. better. by reducing my anxiety and such, following cbt-i techniques, etc, but I still have severe sleep state misperception almost every night. I'm hoping this betters. I can't tell if I was awake or asleep. I feel like I am awake and asleep at the same time. I'm doing a whole lot better anxiety wise now that I know I'm not dying. Before I knew what total paradoxical insomnia was I was convinced that I hadn't slept in FOUR months and that I must have had FFI or SFI. My doctor explained to me that I must have paradoxical insomnia and I'm not registering if I slept or not; even though- I am apparently sleeping. I was having no cognitive issues, no hallucinations, no symptoms of any type of syndrome, no symptoms of FFI or SFI despite "not sleeping" for four months, etc. I realized he was right. The un-knowingness is probably the most frightening thing about it. I can never answer for how long I slept or if I even did in fact sleep because : I don't know. This makes it difficult for me to answer doctor's questions about sleep and it gives me a lot of anxiety because I worry maybe I ACTUALLY didn't sleep. And a lot of doctor's I have spoken to where I'm from assume I'm making it up because, they've never heard of it, "how could you not know if you were sleeping or not?".**TLDR; I have paradoxical insomnia, I've been doing better but still have some misperception. Feeling overwhelmed.**
NotSignal	I have slept about 2 hrs every night no matter what I do for the past 2 weeks but no history of sleep disorders before this. I am wondering if anyone else has had this experience and what can be done to help mitigate? My job performance is suffering
Signal	Check my post history for my last postI was freaking out about nothing. the 1mg was pathetic, I had to take 3x the dose just to get to sleep. I believe that may have been because I ate a couple hours before hand, so I’ll try on a completely empty stomach tonight. I don’t feel groggy which is nice. My whole body hurts though. The metallic taste wasn’t too overwhelming. Overall, it felt like an even less powerful K-Pin
Signal	I tried some sleeping meds that I can’t remember the name of, but they did nothing from the get go. So now I’m taking the generic Ambien but now it’s a hit or miss. Has anyone else had that problem?? I’m really bummed because it was working so well and I was doing great with it
Signal	I used to be able to sleep perfectly fine most of the time. I’d often sleep in until the afternoon. When I started drinking, smoking weed and taking an antidepressant my sleep slowly turned to shit. I quit weed for good because it was making me very anxious. I’ve tapered off my antidepressant before. I’ve quit drinking a few times (longest 3 months). After all this I still cannot have normal sleep. It feels like I fried my brain. I desperately need good sleep because I have IBS and it’s harder to deal with if I don’t sleep well.
NotSignal	Lately the more immediately tangible things I spiral about when trying to sleep have delightfully taken a backseat to much bigger and scarier questions. Mainly, is our existence meaningless, is religion a farcical consequence of our tendency to derive meaning and demand answers, etc.Fun times! Hope you’re all ok tonight.
NotSignal	Just to clear up the "self-diagnosed with ADD". I live in a very beautiful country that has free health care and coincidentally very skillful doctors that totally didn't study in a socialist regime and didn't improve in their work field. That is why I am making this post because I have been to a psychologist and got basically shit on for my ADD (even though I laid out all of the symptoms) so I am kind of skeptical and don't want to lose time and be shit on again.So I am self-diagnosed with ADD and with ADD comes lack of sleep. I just can't turn my brain off and I just end up scrolling through Reddit or playing games till I am tired so that when I go to bed I fall asleep quickly or I just end up rolling in bed for a few hours. The problem is that I can stay awake for 16+ hours and not need sleep, but when my brain finally decides to crash I would end up sleeping for 12 hours. Since 17 years old that time has been slowly decreasing and I can function on about 9 hours now but I still sometimes get knocked out for 12 hours if I spend more than 24 hours awake which is becoming more normal since on some days I have to wake up early for work and I just decide to not sleep since I would only get 2-3 hours of sleep and getting up is harder than staying awake. I am pretty sure this isn't healthy for an 18-year-old.Any tips to help me out are welcome. As I am entering adult life and have a lot more responsibilities my insomnia is driving me nuts.
Signal	As the title says, it's currently 4:30 in the morning and for the past days I've had trouble falling asleep. I had this a couple of years back and forth but now that I don't have a routine anymore it came back. I don't go to school and I don't go to the gym, albeit I try to workout at home but it's not the same nor is it any easier. Is this just happening to me or anyone else? Do I fight through the night or do I work out rn in hopes of getting tired enough to sleep?
Signal	I've suffered from insomnia for years and it usually gets really bad when I know that I really need to sleep. I booked myself a trip to Copenhagen for 3 nights as flights were cheap and I felt like getting away for a bit. I was really excited about this trip for weeks but due to insomnia it has been awful. I couldn't sleep at all the night before the trip and have not slept the last 2 nights either. Yesterday I forced myself to go out and explore but was so tired that I had to come back to the hostel and nap after about 2 hours. Today I am exhausted but still can't sleep and I feel like I can't breath properly. I also have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome which means that I really can't function without sleep. I feel like if I go outside right now I'll probably get hit by a car or something. I'm so depressed as I feel like this is always going to happen when I know that I have to get up early. I've tried various medications but they've all given me worse side effects than if I didn't sleep at all. I've tried CBD and it does nothing for me and herbal remedies like valerian make me feel horrible the next day. I feel like nothing is going to help and I'm so depressed 😭
Signal	Right now it's 5am. I've been up since noon yesterday and I feel tired but I can't sleep.Nyquil makes me restless, my heart rate goes up or something, it's like I can't stop moving.Melatonin makes me wake up every 30 minutes to an hour, makes my sleep effectively worthless.Bendril occasionally works, but often has the same result as Nyquil.How do I tell my parents I want to see a doctor for sleep problems? I think they might not let me due to COVID-19 (I'm in the USA, so it's crazy here)
Signal	And it’s no longer working. It doesn’t phase me at all. This just started happening, but I’m worried about other sleep aides because they have a slew of side effects. I also have addiction. So narcotics such as benzo’s are out of the question for me. Does anyone have any suggestions? Only other one I’ve tried is seroquel but that messed my blood sugar up bad, and is an antipsychotic which I don’t need. Thanks my fellow insomniacs
Signal	I miss the time before, just a couple of months. I used to get home from work and be so tired that I could instantly nap just by closing my eyes. The stress and the work from my job would instantly knock me out. This sleep was like death, no dreams, no black and no white. Just out cold. Some nights I was so worn on that my girlfriend could have the tv blaring, lights on and I would stealthily flip over on my belly and close my eyes to secretly fall asleep.Well that’s all gone.Sometimes I’ll see a character on a show sleeping or watch my dog doze off. Think to myself “lucky”. I want it so bad I want normal so damn bad. I’ll always had sleep problems but never like this. Never so many countless nights. Never before have I been absolutely exhausted yet unable to sleep.Now my bedroom has turned into a scary place where I roll the dice on if I’ll be sleeping that night. I’ll be tired and ready for bed, do the nighttime routine and peacefully slip into bed. And it just takes one thought. One “what if I can’t sleep tonight”. Then I’m instantly triggered with heart racing, muscle twitching and constant nagging intrusive thoughts pounding away like a jackhammer.Being up all night turns into the vicious cycle because sleep deprivation symptoms get worse which make it harder and harder to sleep.Two nights ago I was confident and sleep at least six hours. I thought i was finally out of this. The nagging paranoid thoughts just make it unbearable. I must be dying, I must be going crazy” goes through my head and I’m shaking and trying just to calm myself down. I don’t want to take a Xanax tonight. I don’t want there to be something wrong with me. What if quarantine ends and I don’t go back to normal.I’m really just ranting for myself. Needed to type out my feelings. But does anyone feel like that. Like lack of sleep equals you must be dying or something else extreme like that?
Signal	I posted not long ago about my sleep meds not working (ambien at that time). I was up 60+ hours.Went to the dr and was switched to restoril. I got a great night’s sleep, 12 hours. Not sure at this point if it was because of the meds or because I’d been up so long. The reason I say that is that the new meds didn’t work the next two nights, so I had to go back to my dr today. So my dr gave me a prescription for Lunesta. Pharmacy said take on an empty stomach. Got it. I came home, skipped dinner, came to bed, took meds with a full 20 oz of ice water. No results. Nada. Did drinking the water negate the empty stomach? I didn’t consider drinking water as an issue until it had been 2 hours and I was still awake. My body is hurting, I’m so tired. And I can’t fall asleep. This is hell.
NotSignal	I used to sleep around 3 am but now its getting worse! 7 am and I am scared because I am actually asthmatic and anemic. HOW DO I DEAL W THIS?! WHAT WORKS?? NEED HELP SEND HELP PLS
Signal	I was googling my symptoms of jerks and hypnic jerks when trying to sleep. I’ve had for about a year and half.and I came across fatal familial insomnia I’m so scared right now can someone talk Since into this... I’ve been getting these jerks with adrenaline rush every night for 2 weeks. Also my mouth will jerk I’ll wake up like with a serge of adrenaline. After trying to google looking for supplements to help I say Fatal Insomnia and saw a sporadic form and now I’m scared shitless and it says symptoms are jerks twitches...
Signal	So for the past couple of months i've been pretty active and mindful of my diet and keeping hydrated by increasing how much water i drink. The only downfall is my awful sleep. This started in April and has continued until now. The only thing i can think of is the change of environment because of Covid which has resulted in anxiety and as a result i haven't been sleeping. I tried CBD oil, magnesium + melatonin and finally decided to try taking Vitamin B complex for reducing anxiety. I spoke to my doctor and i'm taking Zopiclone which I cant really tell if it works because i feel super groggy in the morning and I don't recall or remember if i slept. I have periods when i'm awake, periods where I don't remember, and periods where i'm tossing and turning. Anyways, my biggest anxiety and worry is how my lack of sleep is affecting my fitness and weight loss journey. I've been running 8k, riding my bike, doing HIIT workouts over the past couple of weeks and my results have been pretty shitty. I'm feeling super discouraged here! Anyone have advice with weight loss and lack of sleep? Anyone still saw results despite having insomnia?
NotSignal	Before I used to reach two am then force my self to fall asleep but lately I’ll have my eyes closed listening to white noise and just not being able to sleep and it is so annoying just lying down hearing white noise and not being capable to sleep
NotSignal	I’m curious, do most of you know the cause of your insomnia and have to take a medication to fix it? Is the root cause of your insomnia mental or physical? Has anyone here been able to fully reverse their insomnia back to an 8 hour sleep schedule?
Signal	I am bipolar. My moods are managed well on Lamictal and Prozac but I asked for a sleep aid and my doctor put me on 50mg of Seroquel. First of all, it’s already not working for me. It did for like a week. Now, nada. Secondly, I’ve kept up a 150 pound weight loss for almost 5 years. But I’ve gained almost 20 pounds in the last few weeks because I take the Seroquel and then need to eat EVERYTHING. Past doctors wouldn’t put me on Seroquel at my highest weight because of weight gain. Now I know why. I thought a low dose would be fine! Anywho, I posted it on a bipolar group on FB thinking others would be able to commiserate and maybe have some stories of dropping weight when they came off it. I got one comment so far. “Have you tried melatonin?” NAH BITCH. NEVER TRIED IT. I HAVE ONLY BEEN FIGHTING THIS FOR 20+ YEARS NOW. I answered politely. She was trying to be helpful. But those kinds of questions ENRAGE me nowadays. I would be incredibly surprised if they could name something OTC I haven’t tried at this point.
NotSignal	My last wake up was on May 27th. Im so scaredI’ll never crashhhh im game over soon because its 4:15 not tired one bitany advice?? this never happened to me before & i feel energized...
NotSignal	I have a terrible sleep schedule. No matter what time I wake up, how long I sleep, or anything, I always tend to stay awake really late (about 3-4 am). Sometimes, like tonight, if I try to go to sleep I'll see rapid flashes of light on my eyelids that make it impossible to fall asleep. I tried to Google search what could be going on but couldn't find a match for what I'm experiencing. It's just really rapid and intense closed eye visuals.
NotSignal	It’s been like this for a while now where I get the occasional night of no sleep. I just started a new job and I have to get up pretty early in the mornings so sleep seems more important to me. But when night finally comes and I’m in my bed, it doesn’t feel like my mind is racing but instead my body switches from being really hot to freezing if I remove the covers. I’ll try closing my eyes during these moments and my mind somewhat wanders but I get hot again which stresses me out and I end up tossing and turning for hours. Has anyone ever felt like this or have tips to combat it?
NotSignal	I wake up every night for hours in the middle of the night. I have a back injury and every position gets uncomfortable after a few minutes. Then I get anxiety that if I stay in a position that’s uncomfortable _now_ and fall asleep like that, then I’ll wake up with a flare up and be in nauseating pain. It’s mostly irrational if i have proper posture but the fear of the pain is so strong that I get antsy and claustrophobic and feel like I *need* to move. I also have a girlfriend who gets grumpy with me in her sleep when I toss and turn. She huffs and puffs and groans at me and thrashes when I turn over or move the sheets. So I get anxious about not disturbing her or waking her up and try to stay stiff as a board.An easy solution would be second bed, but a) small apartment b) girlfriend says she would much rather deal my insomnia than sleep apart.I’m new to this sub so are there ways y’all deal with that claustrophobic “need to move or else I’ll explode” feeling? Sick of this catch 22 and of getting so little sleep.
NotSignal	Ever since I cried about something personal and heavy yesterday, I stayed up until 7 AM and woke up at 11:30. I took a nap around 2 PM and woke up at 5:55 PM.I tried to fix sleep by heading to bed at 2 AM earlier (it's 6:31 AM here as of posting this.), but I woke up at 3:45 AM all of a sudden and I couldn't sleep right after. Will this work?
Signal	Maybe my case of insomnia wasn't as bad as some people on this subreddit but I wanted to share what helped me in case it will help some people on this subreddit. A while ago I was going through an extremely difficult time and as a result would wake up in the middle of the night with a lot of anxiety and wasn't able to sleep afterwards. I knew how important sleep was for me and this ironically made things worse. Not only was I anxious about my life, I also started getting anxious about the anxiety itself because it would stop me from sleeping. I did my best to not think about it but that made it worse. Even sleep aids in a way made it worse because when they didn't work, my anxiety would skyrocket and my mind would race even more. During this difficult period of my life, I was researching rigorously for ways to deal with my anxiety and I discovered something called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Unlike a lot of other models that focus on distraction from anxiety and changing negative thoughts to positive thoughts, ACT said that the best way to deal with difficult thoughts and emotions was to accept them.I honestly thought it was bullshit at first and didn't try it at all. I knew that my anxiety was what caused my insomnia and if I didn't reduce it, it would just get worse. However, one night I tried out one of the ACT meditations and I was shockingly able to get to sleep.I think a large part of sleep anxiety is getting anxious about being anxious which in turn, ramps it up exponentially. I've linked some online ACT meditations. The Anxiety Rescue one is what I found most helpful:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY4xiUKM-sI&list=PLH97JSyD8EvbpAnaqYeVyt5bUsIDNdxp4&indexI really hope this helps someone, insomnia sucks.
NotSignal	Can someone tell me a way to keep my room cool I've got on my ac/fan yet I still feel like I'm burning up any tips?
NotSignal	When I lay down in bed to sleep, my heart races. It’s so powerful and I can feel it throughout my body, almost like my heartbeat when engaging in heavy exercise.I think that’s stopping me from sleeping. Does anyone else have a similar issue? It’s just started for me.
Signal	I have online school in 3 hours! I can’t sleep throughout the last six hours. I keep thinking about school and it’s affecting me. To make it worse I have health anxiety.
NotSignal	Hello, I am a film student looking for people with repeated short-term or long term insomnia to interview for a potential short documentary, created with gear supplied from my University and a small crew. If you are interested, private message me and i will return you more details. Thanks for reading.
NotSignal	So I’m wondering what are the symptoms of insomnia. I ask because I’m wondering if I suffer from insomnia. Now I’m not one of those people that is barley awake at midnight saying they have insomnia. I also am curious about insomniacs as well, do you go days without sleep or is it on and off. I’m curious because I want to know more. Also please don’t take this as me being ignorant, I really feel bad for people that suffer from insomnia
NotSignal	Hi I came to this page to share my soundcloud. I hope some of the sounds I created can help in any way some of anyone’s troubles falling asleep. My User is Theo Lizotte on SoundCloud.
NotSignal	I'm in the 8th grade and my grades are a dumpster fire, and i think its the lack of sleep i get every night, but I don't know how to get my body to stop and turn off. Sleep music and stuff work but not always though, i've googled, asked, and researched many things but still can't. Does anyone know how to help?
Signal	When I had the right drugs I’d scroll past this sub, like I didn’t need to follow the users here. Sometimes with great haste. I even contemplated unfollowing it because the posts brought back memories of how inescapable insomnia is, and how that doesn’t apply to me right now. As a drug user I believe this condition is at the root of every demon that has gotten me. All I was really looking for was a deep, easy sleep. When I don’t sleep, I feel derealization or depersonalization the next day. Fearing this intense level of anxiety, without something to knock me out, my own anxiety about not sleeping becomes the most cruel self-fulfilling prophecy. I watch my boyfriend sleep after we got in bed at the same time 25 minutes ago. He’s clearly unconscious, deeply asleep while my mind is racing the same way it was when we got in bed. It takes hours for me to fall asleep, if I ever do. Anxiety the next day left me jumping from alcohol to benzodiazepines to get enough sleep to function. I don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes, late at night, suicide comes to mind as the only escape, even when I become frightened of my own thoughts. Somehow I feel trapped inside my mind at 3 am, like my soul needs to leave this body and rest somewhere else for a while, but my body is a jailer that will not let me rest. I rotate through anger, fear, desperation, weeping, and ultimately I feel helpless. Is there ever any hope without some form of drug?What is wrong with me? Why have I been cursed with this? Without drugs, will I ever truly sleep again?
Signal	So today’s my birthday (27 F) lol please help me I’m also on mobile I’m sorryIt’s 4am and If I don’t sleep by tonight that will be my third day of not sleeping for the 82827281th time. I don’t have any reasons why, I’ve spoken to so many doctors and I’m at a loss. When I do sleep, I sleep for 8-10 hours and then I’m up again for how ever long. My partner who I live with feels like a piece of shit because they just sleep all night while I lay there. I don’t hold it against them, I wouldn’t wish not sleeping on anyone but I really need some help. I found a list of questions so below are the questions and answers. I deleted the questions that don’t apply like “how was your insomnia cured?” Because it isn’t....* 1: How long haveyou have Insomnia?I’m 27 today and since I was at least 16* 2: What exactly are your Insomnia problems? I go for extended periods(72+hours) of time with no sleep at all. * 3: What have you tried so far to cure your Insomnia?(Everything over the counter)(zopiclone 15mg trazadone 300mg — together)(2mg Xanax)(5/10mg Valium)(50mg topamax, 10mg propanalol — together)* 4: What helps for your Insomnia? Nothing I eventually sleep after pure exhaustion * 5: What didn't help for your Insomnia?Doing everything and I mean actually everything I’ve been told so far. Diet changes, life style changes, chiropractors massage yoga * 6: What are you currently doing/taking right now to treat your Insomnia?Suffering * 7: Do you work out? Go to the gym or any other sports?I live in a place built on a big hill and I walk every where? * 8: Are you currently receiving professional help?I was until COVID but what they were doing also wasn’t working * 9: What's the longest time you haven't been without any sleep? 9/10 days of actually no sleep* 11: How many hours do you sleep a night? None when I do sleep it’s usually 8 hours and then I am up again. * 13: What kind of work do you do?Physical labour? I build bathtubs and spray fibreglass40-50hours a week 6am-2pm usually * 14: Do you have any problems with your eyes because of Insomnia?I have no ideaEdited because it looked like I took all those drugs at once
Signal	Im not complaining because i just want to generate conversation but heres my situation.My sleeping schedule is typically sleep at 7am wake up at 4 or 5pm. Its been like that since the pandemic.Now on sundays there is a certain sport that starts very early that i need to watch. So i get in bed by 12am thinking ill get 6 or 7 hours of sleep.Its now almost 4:30 and the closest thing so sleep was deep imagination which lasted 50 minutes. I woke up at 6pm last night ive only been up for 10 hours.I dont want to take my murtazapine despite it knocking me out. Mostly coz ill be a zombie and on 3 hours of sleep.Ive been debating to take my pain meds (codeine) and just close my eyes. Or make a coffee and sleep tomorrow nightBy the time i make a drcision itll be 7am...
NotSignal	If you’re like me and regularly sleep and wake up at stupid times, example: go to sleep at 4AM then wake up at 2PM, then this post might help. This probably wont help you if you have more severe insomnia. Obviously, this works for me because I sleep for 10 hours at a time, so after reading this ajust the times accordingly. The general purpose is to gradually go to sleep later and later until you sleep at a reasonable time. Fucked up sleep cycles mostly come from gradually going to sleep late, so thats how you’re going to fix it.One method I see people doing to try to get a normal sleep pattern is to simply going to bed earlier. So instead of 4AM, you would go to bed at 12AM. But the problem with this is that you wont be tired because you woke up late that day. Then when you try to sleep at 12AM you will be in bed unable to sleep until 4AM, for example. Then the cycle continues.Another method I see is to say ‘fuck it im pulling am all-nighter’. They wake up at 2PM then stay awake that night then try to sleep at 6-8PM the following day. Not only does this make you feel like absolute shit, it definitely is not good for your brain. Ive also found that it is actually very ineffective in fixing your sleep pattern. This is because when you do sleep after staying awake for that long, you sleep longer to make up for lost sleep. So you would possibly end up waking up in the afternoon.A trick I have found is to do my last example but instead of trying to do it in 1 day, I do it in 3 days gradually. Wake up at 2PM (14:00), but instead of going to sleep at 4AM (4:00), go to sleep at 10AM (10:00). You should be tired at this point but you wont be absolutely fucked off of little sleep. You should then, theoretically, wake up later then 2PM (14:00) in the afternoon. Lets say 8PM (20:00)So now you just woke up at 8 at night. Now, you need to stay awake that night and go to sleep later then you did before (10AM 10:00). For the purpose of this post, sleep at 4PM (16:00) in the afternoon. You should wake up at at about 2AM 2:00 in the morning. Then stay awake and try to sleep at anywhere from 8PM-10PM (20:00-22:00) and boom. You should wake up at a reasonable time.After doing all of this, it is your job to avoid caffine, sugary drinks, phones, tv/computer screen and do regular cardio and exercise to fall asleep at 8PM-10PM again. Pros of doing this method:It minimised the horrible feeling of being extremely sleep deprived.Cons of doing this methodIt takes 2-3 days to do and you’ll be sleeping at very strange times.
Signal	I haven’t been sleeping much this past week, my insomnia comes in waves. Really depends on what mood I’m in (having bipolar doesn’t help). My sleep hours all fucked up, and now it’s messing my routine up. I’m to broke to buy tree, that would help my insomnia, my body aches, my nausea, my headaches, my panic attacks.... just everything. I’ve been laying here wide awake trying to sleep. Took me almost 2 hours until my eyes got heavy from staring at the ceiling. Tonight I’ll try and sleep for 20 mins but obviously that’s a joke, my mind is constantly racing. So then I ask myself what’s the point and go on my phone, or my switch. My head feels insane, and it’s the worst at nights. How am I supposed to manage a stable life??!! *internal screaming *
NotSignal	I know caffeine isn't the root of every single case of insomnia, but I know it has helped me a lot and could potentially help others.I believe the problem is the insomnia makes you exhausted, so you compensate by drinking a lot of caffeine, and then you drank too much and can't sleep yet again. I've found that by limiting my caffeine intake to 1 cup of coffee per day, it's improved my issue. I also make sure I drink it around 7 AM every morning, so it'll definitely be worn off by the time I go to bed. Not entirely, but now a rough night of sleep for me is getting 3-4 hours, rather than when it used to be only getting 1-2 hours. It's tough at first, but I've found that now I have an easier time falling asleep, and also my quality of sleep has improved as well. I wake up more energized with less caffeine, because I just sleep better. The root of my insomnia seems to be that I get anxious at night, and I'm also pretty sensitive to caffeine. So if anyone else has similar issues, it might help as well!
Signal	People on here telling me to workout, but I'm allready fucking exhausted after walking 4 miles, after not sleeping well for about a month (4hours and less)..Anyone experienced this weakness before? I wish I had my old strength back..
NotSignal	I go to work and I can't even do the simple things without being distracted. When home I try to do the basic housework but only stare at it, drifting off in my thoughts whilst not being productive.It's not a lack of drive, it's a lack of ability to achieve. I've now gone 26 hours without sleep as of writing this and hope to catch a couple hours later in the day.Let's just hope it brings back the focus I so very miss
Signal	I take 300mg Seroquel at night for bipolar but mostly because it is the ONLY thing that gets me to sleep. I even used to take 3mg Xanax and I’d be up all night. Well I forgot to pick up my prescription yesterday and I’m WIDE awake at 4 am. I mean I feel like I’m gonna lose it. I’m so tired. I’m beating myself for forgetting to grab my prescription. I just want some sleep.
NotSignal	Hi guys!I remember times when I had a strong desire to sleep. This state of mind when you just want to lay down, close your eyes, and have a sweet transition to sleep. Now I have nothing like that. Every night I force myself to lay down I don't have trouble falling asleep though. Sleep comes to me in 10 minutes no more. It doesn't matter how tired I am or how long was my day. I just never feel sleepy.Have you experienced something like that?
Signal	Hey guys, i have been facing sleeping problems since 10 years so far; I sleep roughly between 3 and 4 hours a day. Meanwhile i have developed chronic fatigue and hypersensitivity. Still, out of these problems, the most-worrying is: Am i going to die early? I wasn't able to google the problem properly and understand the correlation between insomnia and early death. I am very worried and would appreciate every information.
Signal	Hello fellow crazed people!I am posting in hopes that even a single person is helped. Long story short, in December I developed a severe medical issue that made sleeping and being awake extremely uncomfortable, but I felt especially tortured at night. I conquered this issue, but after it left, I found it impossible to sleep.I was awake for over three consecutive days that first week. The following weeks, I would float between 2-4 hours a night. I tried every herbal remedy, meditation, therapy, hypnotism, sleep hygiene, and eventually Trazadon and Mirtazapine. I would have at least 2-3 nights a week with 0-1 hour of sleep. It broke me and I wanted to die.Nothing worked or made me feel better. The Trazadon made me get between 4-5 hours a night but the effects were devastating on my personality and demeanor. I was trapped in hell and thought my life was over, I would be medicated until I died. I wanted Benzos, I needed something stronger, but I hated the pills and knew I needed to stop. This is when I came across the concept of ACT, acceptance commitment therapy. I began self-administering and quite literally almost broke down in relief within days. So, so many of us are capable of breaking this cycle and healing naturally but we just don’t know it. I quit my pills and marijuana (a 10 year habit) immediately, against all recommendations. This is when the healing began.I realized that everything I was doing TO sleep was what was making me NOT sleep. By creating rituals, searching for answers, fighting negative thoughts, I was guaranteeing the cycle continued. By accepting my insomnia, by accepting a sleepless night, my pain immediately diminished. It sounded so absurd at first that I could relieve myself immediately by accepting it and I didn’t understand. I bought several books, the most helpful being the Sleep Book by Dr. Guy. After delving in to the subject, I realized instantly that I was torturing myself and creating my insomnia. I’m not saying this is how it is for everyone, but for me, I was amplifying my pain by worry and anticipation throughout the day. The book and concepts online explained to me that I needed to ACCEPT my pain and suffering. That when bad thoughts or worries entered my head, don’t push them away. When my heart pounded in my chest at night, embrace it, think about it, thank my heart for keeping me alive. We are all human and know how to sleep, there is nothing we need to fix or change. When we concentrate so hard on fixing things, they become further broken. ACT changed my life and stopped me from going down a path that could have ruined me. CBT wasn’t the answer, pills weren’t the answer, I ate very clean and exercised daily and nothing helped. But when I began performing mindfulness exercises and began to embrace my situation rather than fighting and trying to change it, everything clicked.Since the third day of self-administering ACT I have slept every night. I am happy to go to bed instead of tortured and anxious. I am able to see my friends again and experience pleasure during the day. I highly recommend this if CBT hasn’t worked. It sounds so stupid and impossible, especially to me as a skeptic initially, but it changed everything. I probably didn’t do a great job of explaining things so please feel free to ask questions here or PM me so I can give better answers.Good luck guys
Signal	I generally fall asleep fine but always wake up after 6 hours so around 530-6, in this half conscious state of intense dreams and being awake and my brain feels like it’s on fire.I can hear myself talking jibberish sometimes, and I’m completely wrecked for the entire day.I take antidepressants and have anxiety depression.
NotSignal	It’s a cool app that is a sleep training app and helps restore your confidence in being able to fall asleep. It’s based on an Australian sleep research. If you guys have tried a lot and are struggling, I think the app is worth the price. It definitely worked for me sometimes and some people say that it cured their insomnia. Just throwing out suggestions.

NotSignal	And I'm absolutely PISSED because every time I almost fell asleep SOMETHING dragged me back awake. First it was some idiot blasting his bass right in front of my apartment. Then, my next door neighbors decided to stomp up and down the hall and have a loud argument between their hall/their bathroom which both share a wall with my bedroom (have complained, he is somehow mysteriously never home when the landlord calls or the cops come). Then, somehow a draft pushed open my bedroom door that I had a very heavy object in front of and proceeded to bang against until I closed the windows, which I didn't want to have to do as it is finally nice outside.Y'all. I'm going crazy. I'm schizophrenic and bipolar and coming off mania and I legit just WANT TO FKING SLEEP.
NotSignal	And I’m here scrolling on reddit. It’s nice to have friends over tho— something about it is so soothing. Just. That. I. Can’t. Sleep. Even when my anxiety is low thanks to them hdjdhdjdhdkdjd RreeeeeeeeeeeeeeThank coming my ted tok
NotSignal	A week ago I had a bout of insomnia and posted here. I ended up landing in a consistent schedule but with awkward hours, waking at 6pm and sleeping around 10am. Yesterday I went to a friend's house to play cards with him and another friend. Due to my awkward hours he had to come to my room and wake me when he came to pick me up. That wasn't so bad because it was only slightly early but after getting home I decided to try to stay up later than usual and see if I can get better hours. I even had a soda. As I'm sure you can guess, it didn't work. I was in bed for hours. I wasn't fully there the whole time but I don't think I actually slept or at least don't feel like it. Now I'm sitting here tired with an upset stomach again. My room is cold which should help but just makes me feel cold so I get another blanket and warm up which also doesn't help with sleep. Should I just wait till dark and hope I can sleep then or should I give it another go now?
NotSignal	You read that. I wiggle my legs in a certain way, not on purpose. And it stimulates....things... And I fully realize that a "solution," someone will say is "Just go use a sock." Or something like that. I'm struggling basically 24/7 with the thoughts. It's been 3 years since a girl has come near me. It just sucks!! And all this keeps me awake, wanting to be loved, feeling empty, lonely, and - the only word for it is like ab aching - a yearning - or longing - for someone I havent met. My mind journeys far and wide, remembering people, smiles, laughter, mistakes Ive made that cost me love. It's... Then I'm all hot under my covers and becoming exasperated. Can't deal with it every night!! Am i the only one? Where love (masturbatory RLS) keeps him AWAKE?
NotSignal	A close friend of mine told me that she has mild insomnia and I want to be able to help support her if I can.
Signal	Hi everyone - been dealing with insomnia since the birth of my second daughter (22 months old now) and have done the usual sequence of things many do - obsess, freak out, anxiety, medication, etc. at my best, I get 6 hours, and at my worst I will go several days without sleep. Something inside of me snapped about two weeks ago and I told myself I am going to move on from this...I used to be an ok sleeper before, so why couldn’t I get back there? Anyway, I started CBTi about a week and a half ago and am 4 days into the sleep restriction part of the program. It’s been really rough going here lately (sleep window 6 hours and going down to 5.5 hours in two days). I am still optimistic/committed to the process but I feel like support from someone else going through this at the same time would go a long way for me. Would anybody care to chat and go through this journey with me together?
Signal	i havent gotten a minute of sleep and i have school in the morning, i have anxiety that causes my insomnia. Plus i read R/NoSleep and got scared, i know there not real but if you have anxiety you know what im talking about, so i cant sleep due to insomnia, am scared because of anxiety and my room is getting hot lmao. So if anyone knows how to help please tell me, i have tried steps on wiki how and they dont work, and all the other websites tell me what i need to do before bed, and i dont need that lol i need to know how to solve in now not later.
NotSignal	Hello, a little background. I'm a freshman in uni. I usually sleep around 2am and wake up at 8am earliest. On average, 9am because I have to go for lessons. For the past week I've been having trouble sleeping. Yesterday I tried to sleep at 12.40am but struggled till around 4am. Usually I take 30min naps once or twice a day, depends on how tired I am. Naps are fine but not sleeping. I'm thinking of getting sleeping pills. Which brands do you all recommend? Or if you have other ways to combat this? TIA!
Signal	Anyone else have ADD + Insomnia? I take Ritalin early in the morning, and have no trouble getting to sleep but have tons of sleep interruptions all night with my heart pounding and racing. I have a small fingertip pulse monitor that I use to check my heart rate. The weirdest question I ask myself is this:How is it that my heart rate can be 140 in the middle of the night waking up from a dream I know was nothing special, but it is \~55-60 an hour after taking Ritalin and drinking coffee in the morning?Anyone else get this?
NotSignal	for late night convos n such cause I have no friends and need people to talk to r/WackoCrackoClub thanks
NotSignal	It’s 5 am and i can’t sleep!!Pff.. My eyes burn me very hard and idk why I cannot feel sleep, I close my eyes but nothing!!!I’m really sick🤕😞Someone to talk to.. I’m bored
NotSignal	Reading a book?Watching TV?Ging outside to walk in the middle of the night?
NotSignal	That thought r/no sleep was for people that couldnt sleep. So the first time I went on there to read about people's sleep patterns I quickly realized that it was not the case. And ended up staying up even longer out of fear. Idk what point of this post was. To laugh? Hmm
Signal	I think I’m coming off some research chem advertised as Xanax, either that or it’s benzodiazepine withdrawals but I don’t think I did it long enough for that. Was taking about 8mg per day for 9 days no tolerance.Been hallucinating a bit, going back to see my doctor again today but there’s not really anything they can do aside from give me more benzodiazepines which won’t help the problem long term. Never been awake this long aside from the one time I did meth.Yesterday was probably the worst day of my life which is impressive if you knew how fucked up my life has been, anyways l’ll probs fall asleep in a day or two but definitely going to experience some psychosis
NotSignal	So I had developed a reliance on Unisom and then was taking Klonopin in addition for years. I have weaned myself off Klonopin without any major issues. I started taking supplements like Magnesium which helped a lot. (I feel like I probably primarily had issues with nutritional deficiencies that were masked with these OTC and prescription meds.)However, I still am unable to sleep without Unisom. I'm sure part of the problem is psychological (oh, no, I didn't take Unisom; I won't be able to sleep!). I'm guessing that I need to wean myself off slower than in 25 mg increments. Any insight?
NotSignal	Not last night but the night before last night it took me till 6 am to fall asleep, and I slept maybe 5 hours but woke up once in between. I had lots of dreams when I finally managed to fall asleep. Last night I didn't sleep at all, yet my body felt calm; however my mind it seemed would not fall asleep. Everytime I thought I was falling asleep I would have muscle twitches or be excited I was falling asleep then not fall asleep. My boyfriend says I'm psyching myself out and thinks it's anxiety. I feel bad for this but I'm very miserable right now and feel like I may have a mental breakdown if I don't get some sleep soon. I'm thinking of taking benedryl tonight but do any of you know anything better that will knock me out because I don't think I can handle another night of no sleep.
NotSignal	Hi, I'm in my exam period for school and I really don't have that much stress, however as of lately I keep waking up with a feeling anxiety, like 4 or 5 times during the night & early morning. It's not really in my mind though, mainly my body just feels really tense and restless no matter what position I sleep in. Initially falling asleep is definitely not much of a problem until I wake up again, it's kind of weird. I've tried sleeping with and without taking melatonin, I keep waking up no matter what I do. Yesterday I took kind of an involuntary break from studying because I couldn't concentrate at all. I gamed a bit, took a walk, read a book before going to sleep but it didn't help. Is there anything else I can try??
Signal	Hi all, I’ve been taking time release melatonin (circadin 2mg) for about 5-6 weeks now maybe every 2nd day sometimes few days in a row. Sometimes with a break of 3 days in between. Now I am out of then and can’t get to sleep at all. How can I get my body/brain to produce a natural dosis of it again! I am really desperate at the moment. Next week I have an appointment with a slew doc. It’s 447am here in Berlin and have tried everything in the last 7hrs to sleep. Music, reading, meditation nothing works.
NotSignal	Sitting here at 5am sipping on my coffee. My weekend is ruined.
Signal	I’ve been taking 100mg Traz to sleep for about 6 months. It’s worked better than any other med I’ve tried, including ambien, but I’m having way more panic attacks and way more anxiety, especially right after I wake up. My partner also says I’m having nightmares and yelling in my sleep although I do not remember any dreams. Anyone have similar experiences? Should I stop taking it because of this?
Signal	For some context I am on all nighter #2 (not by choice) and have gotten around 12 hours sleep the past 7 days. I don’t know if I feel drunk or manic or just crazy. the last month my insomnia has gotten the worst it’s ever been with being unable to sleep at all at least 2 nights a week and when I do sleep I don’t often get over 4/5 hours. Sleeping medications aren’t an option as I use to be addicted to Xanax for a year and medications which relax you/help sleep are my kryptonite and I can’t control myself around them. Please help what do I do, if this doesn’t stop I will get kicked out of college and I feel like I am going insane. I know all the standard tips and ways to beat insomnia and they just don’t work, if anything they make falling asleep more frustrating (I find it easier to sleep if the tv/radio is on). Any non standard advice on either how to sleep or any advice on how to cope in this delirious state without neglecting all my friendships, getting kicked out of college and loosing my mind would be amazing.
Signal	Hi All,I’ve had insomnia going on 9 years for now. I’m looking for some advice on medications. I was on ambien for years but recently that stopped working. I have lunesta now which doesn’t seem to work at all, I’m lucky if I get a few hours of sleep. I’ve had trazodone which didn’t work at all. The only thing that seems to help is Xanax but I don’t want to be taking that every night for sleep as I need it for other reasons during the day. What other medications have you tried and seen success with? I’m a bit worried because I know ambien and lunesta are really common but just don’t seem to work for me anymore. Has anyone tried quetiapine?I have a call with my psych today but am seriously considering doing a sleep study. I can’t function the way Im going on. Any advice is appreciated!
Signal	So recently my therapist and doctor have come to the conclusion I’m somewhat depressed. If I start antidepressants will I finally be able to sleep? Because trazadone did nothing and neither has anything else. I fall asleep fine but I wake up and can’t go back to sleep for hours and I can’t afford it with having to wake up early for work anymore which has led to sleep deprivation. Hoping if the depression is helped my brain can finally function normally and sleep again.
NotSignal	1. Duration of insomnia2. How much daytime impairment does it cause, on a 1-10 scale? 1 is no impairment, 5 is moderate impairment - it’s annoying, but you can normally function through it, 10 - severe impairment where you can’t hold up a normal job / have considered getting on or are currently on disability
NotSignal	So yeah im a kid in the uk seeing if i can get diagnose ive had what i belive to be insomnia for atleast a year ive tried multiple things that the nhs recommends nothing works. I was just wondering if anyone knows where and how i can get diagnosed right now with cobid happening and everything.Thanks in advanve.
Signal	Same schedule as always. Sleep around 930/10pm, with alarm set for 530/600am.Last few months ive been waking up every night after 2.5-3h of sleep. I have no trouble falling asleep initially, i just cant stay asleep...Once i get back to sleep after waking the first time, the second time is about the time my alarm is set for and i just get up.Starting to worry i have sleep apnea or something serious? Some days im pretty exhausted and end up napping for 40min which i never used to do.
Signal	I’m diagnosed with insomnia, manic depressive bipolar, OCD, general anxiety disorder and panic attacks. I’ve had a terrible day and just want to pass out.I’m prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg twice a day but I usually take 2 at a time and seroquel 50mg at night.I also take 20 mg of Paxil in the mornings.Since I wanted to just pass out I took 100mg of hydroxyzine and 100mg of seroquel just now. I’ll be fine right? I just want to fall asleep. I’ve gotten about 3 hours total in the passed couple days.
Signal	Insomnia knocked at my door almost 6 months ago and I’ll admit that I triggered it. My body has now fully adjusted to the lack of sleep. I am one of the rare people that can have a sleepless night and still feel functional during the day. (Sure, I notice some memory problems as a consequence and heart rate increase as well as palpitations) My only worries are that one day i won’t be as functional as I am on so little sleep and that I’ll begin to have big memory and heart problems. Really, the only reason why i’d like to go back to how I slept is to get back my old sleep routine. It’s so annoying to go to bed at like 10 pm and feel sleepy at around 11 but as soon as I tell myself that I’ll sleep, It takes me hours to fall asleep and to stay asleep. Especially when everyone in the house in asleep till morning.
Signal	I'm getting low and haven't been able to refill, and since I was in the middle of finding a new psychiatrist when quarantine started, I won't have any luck until it's all over. My normal dosage is 300mg and I use it as a sleep aid, is there some kind of over the counter medicine I can use instead? Melatonin doesn't work on me.
Signal	I have been having problems sleeping all my life. When I'm actually asleep, I can't sleep through anything. Recently, I fucking woke myself up on command. I knew I was asleep, and decided to open my eyes. And it felt so weird when the rest of my body woke up. I don't know how I did it, but I suspect that it's my anxiety meds. The pandemic made it so I got them late and I was having nothing but panic attacks the day before.
Signal	A few weeks ago when I tried Doxylamine succinate, it worked better than anything a doctor has tried. Then suddenly yesterday it stopped working. And I thought I was less stressed this week than a few weeks ago.When your body stops responding to a medication, do you take a break from it? I was thinking of taking like a two week break then going back. Before I was able to smoke weed and it would put me to sleep. That didn't even work last night. I like think I slept from 1-3, but I'm not sure lol. I remember looking at the clock at 1, then laying there and checking again thinking it had been a half hour and it was 3 am. So I think i might have fallen asleep then, but not sure.
NotSignal	I always thought that eating late at night would help me sleep by making sure I wasn't hungry. But now I'm starting to wonder, I've taken up fasting for health reasons and I sleep just as well when fasting. I've also read some claims that late night eating will make sleep worse. Is there any research on this? Has anyone influenced their insomnia by altering meal timing?
NotSignal	Anyone else having trouble sleeping during this pandemic. I use to get 7 hours of sleep per night. Now im getting about 4 through out the night for the past two weeks, if I'm lucky. Also to make matters worse. I found out yesterday I have the flu, oh and I developed this lovely ringing sound in my ears that been with me now for about 4 days, due to sleep deprivation. I told my doc. but since I'm 20 and don't have underlying health conditions (I use to be a chronic vaper) I should make a full recovery from the flu despite my lack of sleep. Let me tell you know this ringing in my ear has really got me worried. So my question is, can anyone relate to being so stressed you can't sleep for days?
NotSignal	OK this is the third day I'm not getting sleep and I have given up. Fuck literally I was yawning and thought to myself YES NOW, but of course not. Honestly how long does it take to sleep deprivation do damage to ones brain? Like I'm probably just anxious as shit, I even cried but fuck
Signal	Went to my boyfriends and didn’t bring any melatonin, Xanax, or antihistamine because I had accidentally left a full bottle of melatonin with him last time so I thought I was prepared. He couldn’t find it... and now I REALLY can’t sleep. Melatonin is very hit or miss for me, it works a tiny bit and usually that mixed with being with my partner helps me sleep. Now I’m stuck lying here awake watching my phone battery die, listening to his asmr.
Signal	i’m just wondering if this happens to other ppl too. i don’t normally have suicidal thoughts but for a few weeks now, each time i go to bed i struggle to fall asleep and then these dark thoughts just come to my head and make sleeping even harder.
NotSignal	I just tried a supplement last night, an hour before sleep like it says and it just made me feel far more alert than usual haha, curious to hear if anyone has had good results. I saw better results just eating oats every day for breakfast so far.
Signal	Sorry if this doesn't really belong here but I don't know where else to post this.Growing up I've had a really bad sleep schedule, it ruined me in high school where I would >4 hours of sleep every day. sleeping at 4 am and waking up at 8 of sleep every day. I've tried to force myself to sleep at a certain time but that did not help. I've tried doing all-nighters then going to sleep at a normal time, I've tried doing that for a week straight but after a few days, I go back to not being able to sleep. I've read everything online on how you can get better sleep and nothing has helped me.I can't do this anymore, I got a job that I need to pay attention to, I sometimes have to go even when I get no sleep or 2-3 hours of sleep. It's ruining my life. My workmates can tell that somethings up. If I was just a night owl then I would have no problem I could just get a job with a night shift or I could just work around it but it's so inconsistent with some days. I'll stay up for 20 hours then sleep for 14 hours and then some days I'll only stay awake for 5-8 hours.I really want to find out what's wrong with me and find out how to fix it because right now it's ruining my life.
Signal	hi, i am having lots of insomnia, not necessarily falling asleep but staying asleep. i'll wake up after a couple or a few hours (i try not to look at the clock) and it's still dark out. i go to bed around midnight or a little later and get up before 9 AM, maybe i dont need as much sleep as i used to? but i'm distressed about it.i have a very bad back and had some serious what i thought were muscle spasms, i tried cyclobenzaprine but stopped taking it a little after a week when i started waking up again, i'm usually anti-medication but i am getting back on gabapentin 100mg. i got a new bed and new shoes and they are helping my stress. i put '1st time' in the title because i thought without that it might look like i had advice to offer. i dont recall having a significant sleeping problem in my life but now i am and i'm 29
Signal	My sleeping schedule is so fucked up and i take melatonin and it continues to be fucked up. Its 430 and i have to he up at 10 for virtual school. What do i do?
NotSignal	I want to get one, but I'm doing the research first since they are expensive.I've also heard a lot of mixed things about them, but I am usually open to trying new approaches to handling my insomnia.I think my insomnia is mostly caused by anxiety, racing thoughts, and a fear of being asleep (PTSD). I've been told that weighted blankets are good for creating a feeling of comfort and safety.
Signal	So i’ve been sick the past couple days and i took nyquil to help with it. However, I fall asleep quite easily but the days I take nyquil right before I sleep I keep tossing and turning for hours without falling asleep. Plus i know that nyquil is supposed to aid sleep. Am i just going insane or has this happened to anyone else. Kinda scared i might actually have insomnia :///
Signal	I’ll make this short and sweet but basically I’ve only slept 5 hours in 8 days and I am experiencing delirium. I keep hearing and seeing flys flying around my head and I am also seeing shadows (what looks to be people) darting across the wall. I have tried tons of medications for sleep (I’ve tried to stay away from benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines) but to no avail. I just had a visit with my psychiatrist Thursday last week and went on an increased dose on seroquel (300mg to 400mg) but have not noticed any changes in my mood or sleep. Should I contact my psychiatrist and see if I need to go on a stronger sleep med like a benzo? I know you aren’t doctors but could you share similar stories if you have experienced something like this?
Signal	i have been sleeping fine for 2 weeks now but its the second night in a row where my sleep anxiety somehow came back. Its currently 4am and im so tired but cant fall asleep due to some stupid sleep anxiety and Im so scared im going to go through another rough bout of insomnia where i’ll sleep 1 or 2 hours/night. I dont want to go through another sleepless night. Ughhh I hate my life.
Signal	I have hardly slept in two weeks, I feel like I don't exist. Someone else is controlling my body throughout the day, I am but a shell made of flesh. When I do sleep, it's not restful, I'm plagued with nightmares. I'm so tired, both physically and mentally. I want out.
Signal	Like most, I haven’t slept good since March when the quarantine happened. I was super anxious and stressed out and I would get a decent night sleep every so often. It doesn’t help that my daughter didn’t start sleeping through the night until December, so I had a lack of sleep going there too. The past 2 nights have been especially horrendous and I’m not even stressed or anxious for once.It’s now 12:30am, and I wake up at 7 to start her day. The past 2 nights I’ve barely slept, and last night I was crying around this time because I was just so desperate to sleep. I bought 3mg of melatonin weeks ago to take but it does nothing for me. It worked maybe three nights but then I wake up in the middle of the night. I tried taking it again the past 2 days but it makes me feel like I’m crawling out of my skin and I toss and turn for hours. I made a virtual doctors visit for Monday to see why I can’t sleep, but I’m considering trying CBD oil at this point. I really want to avoid harsh medications if I can. I was going to buy some CBD today but I thought I would just pass out tonight from not sleeping the past 2 nights but jokes on me. I’m so desperate to sleep, any tips? Anyone who has tried CBD oil? Help? 😭
Signal	Hi guys, i am struggling with sleep issues started like 7 months ago. I was always a great sleeper. THe issues started after partying mixing drugs and alcohol. At first i experienced fast heart rate especially when trying to fall asleep, sweatings, later also experienced some anxiety symptoms after such short sleep (at first around 3h a night). My sleep latency was horrible and sleep duration too. Now I struggle only with the sleep issues, the latency seemed to improve but i also wake up during the night and struggle to fall back asleep. I started sleep restriction but I feel like due to the night awakenings my sleep is so poor and not refreshing. I sleep around 5-5,5h so far but it is usually broken. In the meantime i also tried various drugs like trazodone(didnt help at all) and mirtazapine. But i got off of it since i dont want to rely on this. Do you think I could develop anxiety or could it be some sort of neurotransmitter issue? Cant believe it's been 7 months and am not sleeping as i used to wtf!
NotSignal	So obviously that titles wrong. I don’t like titles. I can’t sleep at all and I’m in highschool. I take 30 mg of melatonin and it doesn’t do anything. I don’t look at my phone, eat or drink a lot of sugar, or anything like that. I exercise for at least 3 hours a day and also do lots of work (for school). This lack of sleep has made me start failing school, but I can’t do anything to go to sleep. I’ve been up for 2 days now and don’t even feel tired. Anyone have suggestions to what to do. PS. I take concerta for adhd and mm for tourettes. Does the concerta affect sleep? I know the weed doesn’t.
Signal	I’m writing this with some level of fear and in need of advice. I’ve always liked sleep. Never had a problem doing it. Love sleeping in whenever I can. However, day before yesterday, I woke up suddenly at 5am, and couldn’t bring myself to get back to sleep. I had all the symptoms of being tired: heavy-eyed, could barely move a muscle, and the desire to fall asleep. But as soon as my brain neared unconsciousness, my body would twitch and my brain would jolt awake. It’s like, I can feel my body begin the process of falling asleep, and then I become hyper aware of myself, paying too much attention to what my eyes are doing, listening too much to my breathing, and I inch towards sleep, then, like a reflex, I jolt awake again as if my brain doesn’t want to lose consciousness. This has been happening every time I try to go to sleep since, and I’ve gotten about 8 hours of sleep total in the last two days. I wonder if the quarantine and the general anxiety surrounding the virus has anything to do with this. Since working from home, I work out of my bed, so maybe my mind no longer associates bed with rest? Does this sound normal to anyone? Is something wrong with my brain? Why did this suddenly start happening? I’m very tired, and it’s honestly frightening to think I don’t have any control over when I can go to sleep or not. Please help.
NotSignal	I slept on the couch for like 25 minutes. After that, I went in my bed, super sleepy and never could fall asleep. I don’t know why because i’m not anxious right now. Ugh fml
NotSignal	just venting, ignore me. i hate my stupid fucking useless pea brain. it's like i'm doing everything except sleeping. i've been laying in bed, twiddling my thumbs, thinking about lasagna recipes and wolves for 3 hours. i hate my life and everything sucks. i'm thinking about hiring a professional boxer to knock me the fuck out at 9pm every night so i'll at least get some decent rest.
Signal	I feel like I'm not getting enough air with each breath. I can't fall asleep. Took melatonin and just finished a 45 min guided meditation, no luck. Finally gave up and got on my in phone...
Signal	I had (have) a terrible sleep schedule, past few months due to the lockdown and quarantine, I just slept at 3/4 and woke up at 10-11am ish. I used to feel really exhausted, wanted to get back on track and for the past four days been trying to sleep by 12:30, but I end up sleeping by 4 ish. A couple of days I've had very little sleep causing anxious thoughts and that affected my sleep more. I'm not able to fix my cycle. How long does it take on an average? What's the best method to fix the cycle?Any suggestions would be welcome.(The anxiety is because I couldn't sleep and that in turn affected my sleep more, is this making sense?)
NotSignal	After weeks of CBTi and exercising and even using blue light blocking glasses.Idk what the heck happened or went wrong. I went through a minor depressive bout and ever since sleep and energy has been off the rails bad.I plan to try to get a sleep study soon. So frustrated with how hard I have tried to fix this to no avail.
NotSignal	I don't even understand why I can't sleep. Like technically I do, it's cause school is killing me one day at a time and I have a metric ton of work due on any given day and the expectations are just sky high. But at the same time, my life isn't that stressful, some of my friends have heavier course loads. But I guess I'm just not as good at coping? So I procrastinate all day and then that's made me feel like night is my personal time almost. And I've gone to bed at 6 for a week now and that gives me a solid 21 hours of sleep and just. What do I do?
Signal	Every night, no matter what time I go to sleep, I always wake up after 5 hours, and can't go back to sleep after that. The thing is, I wake up after 5 hours feeling extremely tired/fatigued. It's like I feel like going back to sleep but physically can't. I feel tired the whole day and would end up taking a nap in the afternoon.I usually get a full 8-9 hours of sleep, but recently this has started to happen. Anyone have any solutions to my issue?Note: I occasionally take antihistamines (such as zyrtec, benadryl) to fall asleep on days I need to get up early. I also drink coffee every morning (but not after 12pm)
Signal	So to start I don’t want to label this as ‘insomnia’ yet , but it’s the only subreddit I could think of that could help..So over the last 4 to 5 weeks I’ve been having trouble sleeping. Maximum 3-4 hours at night and maybe a 30 min nap during the day, at first I blamed the nap and managed to cut the nap out of my day , but still maximum 3/4 hours . I wouldn’t be a big drinker of alcohol max 1-2 days a week and never over the top. I wasn’t too worried about it until today when travelling for 6 hours to work with my buddy. I got about 7 hours sleep with was a very first in the last 5 weeks and felt great got up breakfast etc . Awake about 1.5 hours at this point and I wasn’t even 20 minutes into the drive and I had to get my buddy to drive because i physically couldn’t keep my eyes open and almost drifted off to sleep behind the wheel. I also used to drink coffee in the morning and energy drinks if i had a long day ahead but since the sleep issues i cut them out as i taught it could be a factor. Has anyone ever experienced this or have any advice? And sorry if this is the wrong subrebbit
Signal	This past week has me feeling completely hopeless. I have had insomnia for 12 years and I’m only 22. I’m autistic and also diagnosed with depression, anxiety, cptsd, ocd and dissociative disorder. My insomnia is so severe that I regularly go days without a single minute of sleep. It has now been 7 days since I managed any decent sleep. I’ve slept 6 hours since last Saturday. I take Zopiclone and it makes me tired but I can’t sleep. I’ve tried everything. I’m terrified because not even sleeping pills work, and this can’t go on. I’m constantly dissociated and my vision is affected when I am awake because I can’t stay focused. Does anyone have any ideas? Even just knowing I’m not alone would help. I’m so exhausted.Thanks
NotSignal	Tried to go to bed at 10 pm and it’s already 5 am, gotta get up in less than 4 hours. No way I’ll be able to stay awake without napping tomorrow which will make tomorrow night just as bad, is it bad to take something like Benadryl just so I can sleep better?
NotSignal	I recently learned and unlearned a thing. I learned how to breathe properly after 4 years of continual suffering from breathlessness. I unlearned the ways to fall asleep. What am I now? A happy and healthy person. How to breathe properly? Breathe from your belly. Do the Kapalbhati exercise for atleast 5 minutes daily. How to unlearn the ways of falling asleep? Do the opposite by trying to stay awake. Do not let your eyes to close down, try to keep them wide open.
NotSignal	So I have recently started going to sleep later and later, usually it isn't even because I am tired but because I know I need to sleep. I will be staying up until 6 and 7 am before I get to sleep, and I still won't be tired when I try. I have never been diagnosed with insomnia, nor do I want to self diagnose, but has anyone else experienced this extreme level of sleep loss, if so, what can I do about it?
Signal	It was a good 2 or 3 days where my sleep schedule wasn't so messed up. But now it's getting back to how it used to be i.e. sleeping at 5 or 6am. What helped was melatonin but it isnt working as well as it used to (given I did drink a monster at one point yesterday). I always have my bouts of days meaning where I'm awake for a full 24 hours and rarely 30+. Any advice will be welcome.Oh and I know the energy drinks are fuel to the fire but I drink them rarely now
Signal	TW+TMI: ED like behavior. For context my insomnia is sleep maintenance as well as poor quality sleep. It started last year, funnily enough around the time I started taking my health seriously (I was 436lbs at the time now i'm down to 280). My doctor basically said I was fat and I need to eat way less and move more. I had no idea what I was doing at the time but I started with eating 1200 calories and exercising like crazy, the weight dropped like crazy and I thought this was normal. Thats when the sleeping issues first started, it was poor quality sleep but I was told I was sleeping, then as time slowly passed it turned to fragmented sleep, then 4 hour chunk, then fragmented again, i'd always wake up wired but tired, yawning constantly. I lost my appetite quite early on during this and read somewhere that it was normal so I kept going, now i'm 280 lbs, constantly dizzy and lightheaded, movements weird and my balance, my memory is shoddy and eating "too much" in this case a little over 1600 calories would cause extreme pain all over my body, ive been constipated around this time as well. I didn't really realize I was starving myself until I read somewhere about TDEE and BMR and realized that safetly you should only be doing 500-1000 defecits based on your **weight and Exercise.** Now I worry about the long term consequences of doing this because I never put two and two together for so long that I worry about organ damage/brain damage/etc. I have since cut out my exercises and have eaten more and now I feel like my body is not on super stressed mode because the pains worse, but i'm actually going to the washroom more, I actually feel drowsy and not just tired but wired.Tl;dr Basically I gave myself an ED/starving myself for a long period of time by accident and that is causing my insomnia issues.So if you are dieting please be careful and see if this may be affecting your sleep! Now I have to go through an internist and neurologist to monitor for damage.
Signal	I was prescribed 150mg Trazodone each night over a week ago. The drug worked the first night remarkably. I immediately fell asleep, and woke up slightly groggy but quickly recovered. Since then I have taken the drug each night as directed, but it hasn't worked for me as intended. I still take hours to fall asleep, but now I sleep 10-12 hours and I'm incredibly groggy for 1-2 hours. I'm going to stop taking the drug and request something else, I am just curious if this is normal.
NotSignal	Last night was the first time in a while that I had hours of jerks that kept me awake for hours. I took my klonopin as per usual, but as I was falling asleep I imagined a hige bug landing on my hand, and my whole body jerked . After that, every few minutes I would have a little jolt that sent me right back to wakefulness. Could the initial jerk have caused hyperarousal, like my brain sensed danger and wanted me to keep awake just in case? It's so stressful when it happens, I spiral into anxiety badly after nights like that.
Signal	every little sound keeps me awake. My dog snoring, my dad snoring, my brother watching tv on a low volume with the door closed on the other side of the house. It’s awful. Good noise canceling headphones are way too expensive. Ear plugs fall out when i lay down. I’m crying right now because all I want to do is sleep and I can’t. I usually just lay down with my eyes closed for a couple hours. I have ADD so I take stimulants daily but I’m on the lowest possible dose and because of that doctors won’t prescribe sleeping pills. My under eyes are so dark and sunken in I look like a sick child. All I want to do is sleep.
NotSignal	I had a script for CR for about a year then moved and changed jobs and got a new doctor. I fell asleep easily and woke up refreshed. I know it works despite how “bad” it is and I am tired of doctors arguing with me.She will not prescribe because it’s a “controlled substance” and pushes alternatives. I don’t want to try new drugs I want what I know works. I had to fly to from the eastern US to Cambodia last year to stock up for six months when I left my last job and would do that again now if travel wasn’t restricted. I’ll risk a firing squad for good sleep.Are there magic words to get what I need? Someone is obviously getting it prescribed so why not me?
NotSignal	Well, where to start, i guess it should be hard, cuz i guess i'm at that point. Whats the point? Question of my life, but the point i'm talking about is a bit different tho, there's too much care about. about you're the one that don't give one damn about your responses being yelled. Like whats that about, you got promoted to god just to tell me wrong, well duh doing, this is my story, i did passed the point to care, was it smart? well i guess i'm still here thou don't want to be here and just disappear, but that's my issue, if you figured it out, i'm living with my family and its time to move out.`PS. If that's your thought, I do can relate. But what i realized, It is never to late. Show yourself the worth that's inside of you and can inflate. You don't know your goal, well keep searching. There's no one stopping you from being great. Practice and practice and you will succeed. This is the key of life, this ridiculous` ~~role~~ `playing game. Just ask yourself, is it my time to go. Is there something unknown, just waiting to discovered and`OFF-TOPIC but i wanna make something clear, the earth is my home, but DANG people show this place some mercy tho. We're all humans and have background that only they would understand. I don't care if you think its unfair, cuz that's life. i don't follow social but i can feel something grow. and damn right, i mean wth, how many races YOU think there are? If you started out with your hand, you're on the right path , but next time race your fist, because THERES IS ONLY **ONE** HUMAN RACE, and guess what its called, **Humanity, n guess what, this lives in you. SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO? i'd say, yes, YES WE CAN.**sry for that. i have alot on my mind. :pON-TOPIC Anyway back my life, as since writing this, its looking like an all-nighter. well what a coincident, hmm insomnia fighters. from he bottom of my heart, i hope you conquer your sleep-demons and have a nice rest. **\~** And maybe you **dont** want to see **read**, but lets get back to **my experience**: I i had a psychosis, and tried to get help. But even when i got it i realized i needed to figure it out myself. i mean, yay props to me, guess what caused it tho. its my weakness to just jump in a hole. all those walls around me making me comfortable tho. Now the punchline i guess, the person i want to be, because right now im a mess, but i aspire to be. i have dreams and hopes, and i never back down. People take me as a clown, but my determination will bring them down.`^ though if anyone has problems with this kind of stuff, if you have me, i'd love to share a bit of my story. u can hit me up.`PG++I gotta admit, i am not really sober. I took some anxiety killers and smoked a fat joint. Im hoping today is the time i get sober, since the last few weeks even weed won't k/o me. tho i am gonna miss it, i guess some cant relate. but crazy enough, my body, mind n soul need a formal debate, i mean, i really should **meditate.** Lets dive some deeper, i lost count after 6, but i think its around 10 sleeping pills and the last of my 4g's of weed. I guess i did get diagnoses with ADD, well done society, for being a bit too dang late. Oh btw, was it my idea to take? The ADD, yeah, the psych, no way. I only went there for meds, and said; na get it away, and asked for something that I would think that would help since i know me`(yh right)` more than you.. But that's too risky because yeah, a psychosis from a year ago that passed in a month or 2. Even got props that i got out of it quick.`To the people wondering, these are not prescription pills, and aren't a "big deal" in comparison to Xanax or Klona but still i threw em out today. You just gotta take care about your body, because even if you don't feel it, eventually you will. And the longer you wait, the better you'll do.`Anyways, i thought i share some parts on my mind ;) Peace and may the moon comfort you in your bed :)Greets from NL
NotSignal	if i stay up for a long period of time will i get insomnia? i heard that you can get it like that before and i want to know id its true.
Signal	I've been struggling with insomnia and nighttime panic/anxiety for over a year. Some nights are OK, some are terrible. I've been able to use some techniques to make it more bearable for me like getting out of bed and reading, doing yoga, meditation, etc. But lately, I'm struggling.My work has gone to a 3 day a week schedule for COVID19, so half of us are off every other day. The thing is, I'm working 11 hours a day, every other day and it's wreaking havoc on all the progress I've made with sleep.The day before work days, I get anxious about not being able to sleep and have to take medication. I usually get about 4 hours of sleep and I have to wake up at 4:30AM the next day for work. By the end of the day, I am so exhausted I am shaking, my vision is blurry, I have a pounding headache and heart palpitations. I'm so anxious and tired that all of my coping strategies go out the window. I usually end up crying.I know I'll be able to sleep in the next day, but I'm so anxious about not sleeping that I have to take medication. I get enough sleep, but then the cycle starts all over again.I've been taking medication every night when before I was only taking it 1-3 times a week which was a huge deal for me so I feel like I'm going backwards and I feel like I'm spinning my wheels and going crazy.Do you guys have any insight? I'm struggling.
Signal	Im trying to sleep earlier, i want to sleep at at least 4 am not noon. Doesnt matter how little i sleep or what I do before i get in bed or do in bed it just has not happened once in the last 5 months or more. Ive maintained it but thats it.
Signal	So for about the past year and a half, I have relied on alcohol to sleep. I know it's terrible, I know all all of the repercussions, spare me the rants please. I quit four days ago. I havent slept more than four hours since but the sleep is SUPER restful compared to when drinking. I always justified drinking to sleep as "some sleep is better than none" and would wake up feeling AWFUL the next day, like I hadn't slept at all. Now I sleep 2-4 hours and its better than 6-8 with alcohol. I'm mad I didn't do this earlier but I'm just glad I finally have. I see my psych again in two weeks and am hopeful for the future.
NotSignal	How do you know if you are a dyslexic, agnostic insomniac?You lie in bed at night wondering if there really is a Dog.
Signal	I probably shouldn’t be posting this in an insomnia sub lest I get told to gtfo, but usually I sleep great. Regular sleep schedule, short sleep latency without a need to actively practice sleep hygiene. If I’m stressed or a bit too awake I take 400mg mag glycinate which sedates me and I’m out. Except, once or twice a month I’m completely sleepless for over 72 hours. It’s the death of the overtired. If I’m awake for over about 22-24 hours for whatever reason, I won’t be able to sleep for the next 48. I can feel the switch, from being sleepy to being not sleepy but fatigued. It happens within an hour. And at that point I know I’m fucked. I won’t be able to sleep that night or the next two nights. 72 hours of torture, physical pain and mental fatigue, inability to think or process anything. Eventually, almost on cue, my body gives out and I’ll finally sleep for a few hours, get just one hit of deeper sleep, wake up feeling kissed by an angel till the cycle repeats a few weeks later. How to fight the overtired. Sleep hygiene/CBT does NOT work. It is a physiologic thing, I can be completely “thoughtless” but will realize an hour later I’m still awake. I’ll get up and do something for an hour, feel exhausted and then try again, I call them “sleep trials.” It will happen when I’m at home on vacation and have nothing to do the next week. When the ovetired hits it hits. Mag does not work. Benadryl does not work. I have yet to try a Benzo, but have obvious reservations. PleAse help. I’m at hour 48 and there’s another 24 to go.
NotSignal	Hi fellow insomniacs. Very annoyed after trying without success to sleep. I swear to god the sky getting brighter is the world taunting me.
NotSignal	Hello, I really wish I could explain this feeling better. I fall asleep around 9 or 10, usually very fast. I wake up in the middle of the night or around 4am with the worst feeling, I cant even describe it. My head hurts, my stomach feels funky, my body feels hot and cold, heart is racing. Its wild. If my dreams are deep enough I can feel the uncomfortable feeling in my dreams as well. But as soon as I get up and start moving, that feeling goes away. Its ONLY during sleep. Obviously it carries over into my day to day if I cant get back to sleep. I had to take time off sprinting because that onlu exacerbated it. If anyone knows what this could be, please let me know! I can answer more questions about it as well if I was too vague. My background: 31 YO Male Extremely active, not overweightMilitary 10 yearsI do have Anxiety/PTSD and take 25mg of Zoloft dailyHad heart checked out about a year ago and looks good.a
NotSignal	So I’m 26(f) and I live in Texas. My doctor doesn’t think I have insomnia. He says I have delayed sleep phase syndrome. Basically I’m just a night owl. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone was up for a chat? Message me 🙃
Signal	I can have a good night’s sleep... in absolute silence. I got some foam earplugs and they were great for the past few days, but now they decompress way too quickly and I can hear everything. My neighbor’s air conditioner, the crickets in the garden, everything. I tried sleeping without them but not only did I struggle to fall asleep, but I inevitably wake up after an hour or two. What can I do? It’s really driving me so insane
Signal	Super weird but I’m noticing I can’t get to bed easily since I’ve cut back on my calories. And believe me, I’m not starving myself over here... but I can’t sleep I stay wide awake. No caffeine, this is nuts...
NotSignal	Does anyone have success (or issues) taking both diphenhydramine HCI and doxylamine succinate together?
Signal	Has anyone switched or taken both? What are pros and cons to both? I'm maybe wanting to go on trazodone for sleep instead of mirtz. What dosages were you on? Thanks!
NotSignal	Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts?Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts?Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts? Thoughts?
Signal	Im in the middle of being sleepy and conscious.Just dreaming, but not sleeping at all, 4 days in a row now. Half of my brain start feeling weird, when I breathe, i feel like something in my nose, not sure how to explain that. Like cold air.I've tried doing exercise, taking a hot shower, reading, meditation, natural pills, dude, nothing works.No idea why the fuck I cant sleep.I feel like I forgot to sleep. A friend of mine told me that he can give me clonazepam, will that work?Thanks of anyone respond this.
Signal	I live pretty far north, so from early May to late August I experience very little to no actual darkness. I grew up with this seasonal light shift and it never really bothered me, but starting in my late twenties it started being a problem, and now at 30 it’s a real struggle. I have a comfortable eye mask, melatonin, a fan, and I try to be good about bedtime habits, but it’s a struggle to even feel tired before 1am or later. And then I wake up at 4 or 5am. I crash midday and bc I work very flexible hrs I often surrender to a nap even though I know it won’t help me sleep that night. Anyone else got the midnight sun blues? Advice?
Signal	I’ve been taking my seroquel for a couple days now, and have been feeling EXTREMELY exhausted. Like my eyes are super heavy all throughout the day. It doesn’t matter how long I sleep for. It makes me think I didn’t sleep good enough.
Signal	it’s 4:30 as i’m writing this.every single day for the entire year so far i haven’t been able to sleep until past 5-6am, and i was struggling with this a bit last year too.i have anxiety and depression which only makes this worse, and i can’t be sleeping all day because i have school. my mum scolded me yesterday because i slept through period one, even though usually she’s pretty understanding with it and knows i have panic attacks when people yell at me. she doesn’t seem to believe me that i have insomnia, she blames the fact that i can never sleep on my phone. i have a constant headache and my eyes hurt. i’ve never had such dark bags around my eyes.i’ve tried so much, i’ve been trying for years to get a good sleep schedule and nothing i’ve tried works. i don’t know what to do, i’m only worrying myself more at the fact that i can’t sleep. i want to cry so much right now.
NotSignal	I know that sounds kinda weird. How could I not know if I was asleep or not? I really can’t tell sometimes. It’s so weird. I don’t really know how to explain what it feels like. I’m aware of time passing (very fast) and I can think but I feel asleep. But I can’t be asleep. That wouldn’t make sense. It’s wild and I genuinely can’t tell if I’m actually awake or sleeping when this happens. I really don’t know how to describe it. Anyone else have this?
Signal	I’ve had chronic insomnia all my life, so it’s three decades now. Recently tried to get medical help for it now that my insomnia is completely destroying my life and making it impossible to work. Lifestyle changes and sleep hygiene didn’t work. Blue blocking glasses didn’t help. Melatonin and magnesium with zinc didn’t help.So then the neurologist decided to give Belsomra. That was useless. Tried Ambien CR. Got me to sleep but I still woke up all night. He switched me to Lunesta and it’s still not helping. Psychiatrist gave me clonazepam which does work almost always, but doctors seem gunning to get me off of it
NotSignal	I finally was able to wake up early and sleep before midnight and i got a +8 hour sleep, woke up 8:00 am so i think “now i’m able to sleep early from now on” so i went to bed 11:00 pm and i didnt have the courage to look in my phone for hours but it took at least 4 hours for me to sleep, woke up today 12:00. What is wrong with my sleep? I went to bed and i was awake for a long time, i didnt stayed in my phone, just lying in the completely dark with silence and why couldn’t I get to sleep? What kind of disturb is this?
Signal	Over the course of shelter in place, my cycle got very messed up, on top of having trouble with insomnia for the better part of the last decade.I know most of us have tried everything under the sun to catch a few Zs.My cousins husband, a professor of psychology, recommended that I try to distance myself from my phone as much as possible before bedtime. Which I have done in the past and have failed.I tried again, I put my phone in another room, dawned my weighted blanket and blasted my white noise and after only sleeping for 10hrs over the course of 7 days I was able to fall asleep early and stay asleep.No idea how it happened. Nothing has ever worked this well.And since I’m addicted to my phone I had to come up with a new strategy. I turn my phone on “do not disturb mode” and play a game or two of sudoku, lasting anywhere from 15min to 45min. I try to take a mindfulness approach to the gaming, and once I feel my window approaching I close the app and try to catch the window.Most of my sleep issues come down to anxiety, and having this new tool is great!I have also introduced magnesium and an herbal supplement with melatonin. Lately, things have been better than ever!What are your healthy coping mechanisms?
NotSignal	Trying to sleep when you have to wake up the next morning. But while you can't sleep you keep checking the time. Every time you check the time you get mad because it's getting late and you can't sleep and you have to get up early to do something. The cycle continues into the late night/easrly morning. You finally fall asleep. When you wake up your so tired and check the time and realize you only slept two hours. Then your tired all day because you only slept for a few hours. But you think that you will be able to fall asleep easily because you barely slept the night before. But by the night it's time to go to sleep, your not tired and have energy.The cycle continues.Insomnia.:(
Signal	I’ve suffered from insomnia for over a decade, and have tried everything under the sun and have developed a consistent routine and refining with reliable backups that knock me out cold. I typically have a very good hold on my insomnia and only get about one or two sleepless nights a month for the past couple years. But recently, nothing is working. My routine hasn’t changed, the only change is that I have moved house, but it hasn’t been a stressful move as it is a HUGE upgrade to my old place in every way shape and form.I haven’t slept more than 2 hours in a day for the past week and a half. I’m not feeling dizzy or exhausted, nor is my memory suffering like it usually does when I have ended up pulling multiple all nighters in the past. I’m not foggy at all and that is rather concerning to me. Despite my lack of sleep, I feel more energetic and both physically and mentally well than I have in months. I’m also being much more productive at work and home than I have been in a long while and have noticed that I am more patient and kind with my family, friends, and strangers.Is my lack of negative effects due to lack of sleep something to be concerned about? I’m starting to worry that something may be wrong, as I haven’t even felt the urge to sleep and I have been up now for a day and a half, and my last sleep before that was only an hour maximum. I honestly feel great and I think my body may be putting up a facade and I am really unwell. I have been trying to get some sleep for a week but my body won’t turn off the energy.
Signal	I'm pretty sure im not the only one with this issue.. been a problem since i was about 14 but now its at its worst. i can only do a full REM sleep during the day. i can never fully fall asleep at night and if i do its waking up every 30 minutes. I've never had a nighttime job or anything that changed my schedule beforeI've tried Seroquel, melatonin, reduced screen time before bed, even tried a diet change. I've stopped taking sleep aids because they dont work for me at all. its affecting my college attendance and marks, plus my overall ability to do simple things like eat or clean my apartmenti currently live off of energy drinks and caffeine pills to stay awake during the day. its hell
NotSignal	Better than i ever didLooking like a true survivorFeeling like a little kid!tbh fuck insomnia, it's 5AM and birds are singing
Signal	So I (23f) have woken up at least once an hour pretty much my entire life. I only recently learned that that’s a type of insomnia. I guess I’ve gotten used to 5-6 hours of broken sleep, because I’m not usually exhausted. But quarantine has completely fucked my sleep schedule and now I’m sleeping like 3 hours a night, and fully waking up every 20-30 minutes. So I’ll get half an hour of sleep, then spend over an hour (or sometimes 3) getting back to sleep, only to be wide awake in another 20 minutes. I’m gonna lose it. I haven’t slept more than 2-3 hours in weeks and I’m exhausted to the point of crying every single day. Even a double dose of zzzquil doesn’t knock me out for more than 3 hours. I’m scared of prescription sleep meds and can’t really go to the doctor any time soon, but I need something before I completely crack. Any advice would be greatly appreciated
NotSignal	Weird sleep event.I fell asleep on the phone with my girlfriend like I usually do at night and this morning I slept past my alarms which was odd and had a hard time getting up. When I got to work I told my girlfriend I was tired and she said “Oh probably because you were up so late last night.” And that sort of jogged a vague memory of me waking up around 2:30 AM and her asking me why I was awake through the phone. Then she proceeded to tell me I was talking to her for around 30 minutes and sounded “wide awake” when we first started talking and I don’t really remember this at all if only a little bit here and there of what woke me up. When we started to discuss it I got anxious and confused about it. Now during today I also feel extremely clouded headed and anxious and confused and my hands also feel tingly. They also did when I first woke up. Any ideas what this could be?
Signal	Hi fellow insomniacs 👋My first time here on this sub. Last night I tried Ambien for the first time. Popped the pill around 10pm which made me sleepy but I was still awake at 6am 😵😵 I’ve tried other prescription sleeping aids in the past but nothing works. It seems as though my body just doesn’t relate well to them.I was wondering if anyone else here has this experience too? Their body chemistry just not meshing with the prescription sleep meds. Hoping I’m not the only one...And if I’m not the only one, has anyone found a routine that works well for them? Thank you!
Signal	For years now I've had insomnia problems, but lately it is getting increasingly worse. Before the whole corona virus thing and when peoole were still at school, I would go a whole night without sleep no matter what I did, and then go tgo school exhausted. I would then return home and have a nice sleep. The next day I would end up staying up all night, and so on. The cycle happened every three or four weeks but now I can't sleep.I got 0 hours of sleep last night and the night before that I went to bed late, probably at around 1 am. I'm incredibly tires and can't stop yawning, but both my mind and my body are hyped up and full of energy. I've been crying because I don't know what to do, I'm just so fucking tired. I haven't had a full night of sleep since three nights ago.
Signal	I’ve had lifelong sleep problems. I’m 34 and have never slept well. If there’s ever a medicine that helps, I have to take way more than the recommended dose, and even then it will only work for a week or so. I really don’t want to go back on ambien. Does anyone have suggestions for medications that have worked for you in the past? I’ve tried benzodiazepines (definitely help with anxiety and still take them), amytriptaline, ambien, librium, seroquel, silenor, doxepin, trazadone (works but gives me night terrors), temazepam, hydroxizine, belsomra, and clomipramine, which I was just prescribed and obviously is a bust. I take prazosin as well for nightmares, but it only makes me groggy. As you can see, it’s a little complex. Anyone taken anything else that has helped?
NotSignal	Anyone feel their head heavy from behind all day long ? I've been feeling like this for a very long time now .
Signal	So today, its nearly 8am in the morning, I tried sleeping at about 4am,but I just couldn't get to sleep at all. I've had a bit of a stressful day and just keep thinking about things all the time, similar thing happened yesterday, where I tried going to sleep at 4am but I couldn't sleep until about 6am. But now I just completely can't sleep.Does anyone have any suggestions? Maybe a change in sleep cycle?
Signal	I have had intermittent issues with insomnia for many years. I live with my boyfriend and most of the time we go to bed at the same time, but since lockdown began he has had no reason to get up early and likes to play Call of Duty with his friends into the early hours on the morning. I, on the other hand, still have 9am video meetings and occasionally have to physically go into work. I have no problem with him doing this, but trying to sleep on my own makes me anxious. When we sleep together we have a routine and always cuddle before sleeping. When this doesn’t happen, I lay awake waiting for him to come to bed. This doesn’t change regardless of whether he takes 15 mins or 2 hours. How do I snap out of this? It’s been a problem for months.
Signal	I’ve struggled with insomnia for my entire life, including when I was a baby - 17 now - It’s currently 5:00Am where I live and I’ve been up since 2:00 but originally fell asleep around 11:00pm. I have had so many tests and medications but nothing seems to work. From melatonin to benadryl to prescription strength things, I can never get a solid 8 hours of sleep. Even breathing techniques, changing the environment of my room, leaving my room whenever I wake up, staying out of my roomwhile I’m awake, amongst the millions of other tricks haven’t helped me sleep. I am exhausted constantly, but as soon as I close my eyes my brain just goes hyper. I used to have auditory hallucinations when I was younger and I would try and sleep, but that was easily fixed for me now with white noise or a youtube video playing or other noise that’s louder than my brain. My family always makes fun of me because I don’t sleep, and I’m constantly being sent articles about how lack of sleep is life threatening, but that makes it worse. I have generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder as well, and I feel like my brain is just trying to kill me. I used to have to take 35mg of melatonin just to sleep for four hours, but now I’ve gotten myself down to 3mg and I feel hopeless. Without melatonin or any other sleep aid, I stay awake for about 3 nights and pass out of exhaustion. I’m just kind of ranting at this point because, like always at this hour, all of my friends are asleep. This sounds really teenage angsty of me but I just feel like no one really understands.Does anyone know of any good uncommonly told things that may help? I genuinely don’t know what to do and this sub has made me feel welcome and not alone. I hope other posters here get some rest, maybe not sleep but just some relaxation at least. Thank you in advance
Signal	Usually about 3-4 hours into sleep I find myself awake with a crazy amount of energy. My mind racing with ideas and my body, especially upper body and shoulders to be precise, have a ton of energy and it causes me to be unable to go back to sleep for a few hours. It feels like I can't sit still at all, no matter how fatigued I feel mentally, my body and mind are just ready to go.I've tried everything to get rid of this energy as soon as possible, but it feels unstoppable. I've tried working out and I just don't run out steam, usually after a few sets of 20 pushups I find it hard to keep it up, but at night like this I can do twice as many and still keep going after a few sets. The other night I literally went for a run and shower and still wasn't tired. I've tried working on things (non screen time) but I'm so twitchy from the energy and it doesn't die down. The only remedy seems to be time because after 2-3 hours the feeling goes away and I can sleep again.I've tried melatonin pills before bed & benedryl but it doesn't help at all. I've also got a prescription of zopiclone from my doc but it's a hit or miss because this doesn't happen every night, like 3-5 nights per week and although it definitely feels like it reduces the frequency of it happening but it doesn't stop it.Anyone else get this and anything I can do to stop this?
NotSignal	This probably isn't the right place to post this but I thought I'd give it a shot since this community is a bit more active than others. Latley I'll start fall asleep, and suddenly I feel like I won't have control of my body? I shoot up and try to relax myself while it feels like my body is trying to shut itself down, trying to make me drop. Also when this happens, I usually stop breathing. I'm only aware of this because the first few seoncds I'm awake I'm still not breathing. I've seen a neurologist but unfortunately, there wasn't enough apnea detected to give me a diagnosis. What could be going on? Part of me wants to just see what happens if I let my body take over and do whatever, but I;m really afraid that I might not wake up.
NotSignal	Can’t remember sleepingThe past few days, i have been having this strange feeling waking up and I haven’t been able to remember sleeping. It’s like I my eyes are closed for the whole night but I don’t remember sleeping and my mind is completely blank. then I wake up wondering if I slept or not. I’ve never had this feeling before. I know I was asleep because I still have short dreams but it is very weird. I lose memory of being asleep other then dreaming. I usually wake up feeling well rested too. This has happened for the past 6 nights.
NotSignal	Then I’ll ignore you and mock you when you do and it doesn’t work, not even after a month, because you must not be “trying hard enough”.Then, when you stop trying after two months because it doesn’t work, I’ll ignore you and mock you for “giving up so easily”.We win.We always win :)
Signal	So, I only took a few drowsy antihistamine pills and tried to sleep the other night (without them, nothing would've happened, not even 1hr).It was horrendous but so much better than other nights. I had maybe 2-3hrs of sleep that I wasn't even sure was sleep because I just felt like there was so much going on in my head and body. The only reason I know I slept and I wasn't just in that weird half-asleep state the whole night was because I had some really weird dreams that were super all over the place and fast-paced. Then turned into nightmares and I woke up scared. Tried to sleep some more and it was okay but I didn't really sleep much more than that.I got up real early and just watched some YouTube videos and I was so happy that I actually slept a bit. That would probably be such a bad night's sleep for most people. 3 hrs at most of restless sleep? Where have my standards gone? Lmao
Signal	Over the course of the past year or 2, I have developed some insomniac tendencies so I'm hoping to find some relief! I don't actually have any trouble falling asleep. I can pretty much fall asleep anywhere and everywhere but I struggle with staying asleep through the night. I'd say I typically start waking up and becoming restless about 4 hours after I fall asleep. I toss and turn from side to side for what feels like hours before I finally get up because I feel so emotional and distraught that I cant just go back to sleep. I don't drink caffiene or alcohol, my phone screen switches to yellow light instead of blue light at night, I don't have any lights in my bedroom, and I've recently started using a weighted blanket. I live in CO, so I'm lucky enough to be able to use cannabis as an aid, but it's just not cutting it. The weighted blanket definitely helps but I still end up waking up so early that I'm exhausted all day long.Any advice is appreciated!
Signal	I was prescribed 1mg Ativan at bedtime for anxiety and insomnia. Taken alone I cannot fall asleep or stay asleep.Earlier this week I added 50mg Seroquel along with 50mg a Seroquel and slept a solid 9 hours. I don’t recall waking up during the night. I went to bed at 10pm and next thing I realized it was 7:15am.Has anyone mixed benzodiazepines with antipsychotics? I’m scared and don’t want to take this for too long but it works for my body and gets me some sleep.
NotSignal	For the better part of my life I was probably more a depressed and hypersomnia type. Sleeping 9+ hours wasn't unheard of. Now, I'm struggling to get to sleep on a regular basis and staying asleep longer than 6 hours is proving problematic. The sleep isn't that restful either. I have lost 50+ lbs in the last year and been exercising more frequently. Yet I wake up drained. I don't have much reason to suspect apnea, but will look into it again. Last time I checked was probably a few years ago and the result was borderline when I was heavier. There have been times in recent months where I have woken up early and ready to go. Probably December/January? And i hadn't lost as much weight. I do suspect emotional and subconsciously aspects. Work and Money as well as relationships etc. Thes I'm at a loss as how to address quickly OR effectively as they have been ongoing for a long time
NotSignal	Once again having a night with zero sleep. I’ve literally gotten like 4-5 hours combined the last few nights. And I know that’s not even that bad compared to some here.
NotSignal	I have insomnia that comes and goes, it’s completely unpredictable. However, sometimes when I lay down to sleep I can feel this tingling sensation in my body that is very hard to describe. It’s not a strong feeling nor pain or spasming, it’s just tingling static feeling that runs in my body. So, whenever I have this feeling I know I won’t be able to fall asleep quickly. Anyone has this???
Signal	During my work week, I usually try to get into bed no later than 9pm, to wake up at 4:30am. Now that I'm working from home, I find myself going to bed around 10-11pm, but do not want to get out of bed earlier than 7am. I (32/F) have had insomnia for as long as I can remember. I've been taking Ambien and about 75-125mg of Diphenhydramine nightly for a few months now. I usually can fall asleep within 30-60 minutes, while watching slice-of-life anime to unwind my brain (I know watching stuff in bed is bad, but my brain won't shut down otherwise... anxiety), but wake up 5+ times a night. I don't remember the last time I've felt well-rested. I am not sure when I'll be reporting back to work (currently WFH for another two weeks), but I'll have to start getting back up at 4:30am. Do I need to do that for my SRT? Or can I get up at 6:30am every morning instead, and hope that I can be sleeping better and be able to shift to 4:30am when I start going back to work? If I am only in bed for 5.5 hours, do I still take Ambien and Diphenhydramine? If not, what's the best way to wean myself off? I've tried stopping Diphenhydramine cold-turkey years ago and got a severe case of The Itchies, so I don't want to just cut it off completely just yet.
Signal	Hello All. This is not the first time I have posted here as I have been dealing with this issue for about 2 months now. I'm hoping I've reached the end of my struggles, or at least that I am finally on the path to getting better, and I want to share my experience with everyone here. You can feel free to look back at my past posts in this subreddit, but I will do my best to explain everything here.To preface this, I would like to say that I have had a lot of stressors in my life (recent break up of a longterm relationship, being a student, living alone for a bit, etc.) which most likely brought this all on. Also, just because I have a diagnosis that most likely explains my insomnia doesn't mean that this will apply to everyone here. See your own doctors and figure your own self out. I just thought that sharing my experience may open doors for other people to realize the possibilities of what they may be experiencing, as well as giving them hope that things can get better. About 2 months ago, I had a sudden onset of insomnia when I never had any major issues with sleeping whatsoever. I'd occasionally have a bad night brought on by stress or just a night where I couldn't sleep for no reason in particular, but never anything chronic. It started on Sunday, November 30th when I fell asleep and then woke up in the middle of the night and absolutely could not get back to sleep no matter how hard I tried. I had some particular things on my mind, but I was tired and just really wanted to sleep.This happened again for the next couple of nights, minus Monday December 2nd when I slept totally normally for some unexplained reason, until by the end of that week I had not slept at all for 3-4 days. By this time nothing specific was on my mind. This was accompanied by shakes, profuse sweating, jerking in bed, hallucinations, feeling like I was losing my shit overall. I tried everything over the counter, and a psych practitioner at my school gave me an antidepressant that was supposed to make me drowsy but I think only made my symptoms worse. In the middle of the third night, I called an ambulance because I was shaking so bad and my heart rate skyrocketed. This hospital simply treated me for a panic attack with Xanax and Ativan, and I think I got a few loopy hours of sleep in the hospital, but they did not really address anything else that may be the underlying cause of my sleep issues. They discharged me even though I was not confident that they had really solved the problem. The night after they discharged me, I still did not sleep. I was still sweating profusely and shaking. I called in the morning to follow up and they told me there was nothing left that they could do for me in their facility. I had my friends drive me to the nearby psychiatric hospital and checked myself in for an evaluation. While there, they talked to me about my symptoms and my recent life stressors. One of the practitioners asked me if I had ever heard of bipolar disorder. I said yes, and informed him that my paternal grandmother had it and was medicated throughout her life for it. His response was something along the lines of "maybe you have that." The problem was, he didn't really do anything to address it. I was on one medicine for anxiety, as well as the recently prescribed antidepressant, but he did not propose the idea of coming up with a new medication regiment to help me with the idea that I may possibly be experiencing mania. They sent me home with Klonopin and had me under the impression that it was a sleeping pill (I later learned that it's more of an anxiety medication that has the potential to make you drowsy). Regardless, the Klonopin did not put me to sleep, and I felt at a complete loss. I called my parents and told them to come get me from school because I was not going to be okay. This was on December 8th.They came and got me. When I got home, I slept fine that night. And the night after that. And the night after that. The whole first week I was home. Great sleep with no assistance whatsoever. The following week, I began to have a bit of trouble again. No sleep on Monday, broken sleep for the next couple of days. At this point I had made neurologist and psychiatrist appointments, but they were a month out due to lack of appointment availability. Good thing I made them. During this week of experiencing trouble sleeping again, I began smoking weed before bed to help me sleep. It helped me a great deal for weeks, and I went weeks with no sleepless nights.......Until one night it didn't. Wednesday, January 15th, I didn't fall asleep until 5am. Thursday, January 16th, I didn't sleep at all. On Friday, January 17th during the day I went to my primary care doctor because I didn't want to let the insomnia spiral out of control over the weekend if I could help it. My primary care doctor prescribed Ambien. It helped a bit on that night (Friday), but I still didn't fall asleep until later on in the night. Saturday, January 18th, the Ambien did not work and I didn't sleep at all. On Sunday, January 19th, I decided to try smoking weed again because that was the thing that seemed to have helped me the most consistently. My neurologist appointment was the next day, and my psychiatrist appointment was on Wednesday, so I figured as long as I got some sleep I would make it there and be okay. Nope. To the hospital I went again. I was trying to relax and go to sleep and my heart rate shot through the roof. I was shaking so badly my parents thought I was having a seizure of some sort. Mind you this has nothing to do with weed or any substance because this all happened at school a month earlier before I had ever smoked weed in my life. They brought me to the ER. At first the ER here started treating it like the hospital by my school did, but my parents presented the history of what had been going on, and when some of the meds did not work to calm me down/put me to sleep, they decided to keep me until the morning and run more tests. They were very thorough in comparison to the other hospitals I had been to (bloodwork, Head CT, Echocardiogram, kept me on a monitor overnight). Everything came back completely normal, which led them to the idea of something being amiss in the realm of psychiatry. I had missed my neurologist appointment due to being in the hospital, but a neurologist read my Head CT and deemed it normal. The resident psychiatrist came in and helped me form a regiment of medication (Ativan pills because I responded well to Ativan in the hospital, and 25 mg of Seroquel at bedtime) that could help me until I got to my psychiatrist appointment with someone who will monitor me long term on Wednesday. The next few nights, I slept like a baby. Seroquel knocked me right out. 8 hours of sleep with no recollection of waking up in the middle of the night. It was like a miracle. I made it to my psychiatrist appointment on that Wednesday (January 22nd). The psychiatrist determined that all of this was/is a hypomanic episode. He kept me on the Ativan at a lower dose, and kept me on the Seroquel up to 50 mg at bedtime, as well as added a mood stabilizer called Lamactil. I also have a prescription for Propanolol as needed in case my heart races due to anxiety (I needed to take it last night and it helped). I will see my psychiatrist again this upcoming Tuesday to make sure everything is going well and to make any adjustments. The Seroquel has not been knocking me out the past few nights as it did in the beginning (25 mg did it for me at first and I bumped up to 50 mg last night and it still took me some time to get to sleep), and I still feel like I don't get tired as easily on my own, but I have still been getting sleep and feel like I have been on the upswing since being in the hospital last Sunday. I have also been feeling better mentally. This will obviously still be a journey, and I have some fears still of underlying medical issues that may have been missed (particularly SFI... I know, I most likely don't have it, it's so rare, etc. but it's still something I fear). Overall, I feel like this is finally me being able to take steps in the right direction with this whole issue. I'm honestly just appalled that I was at a psychiatric hospital in early December and they were either not able to or chose not to address the issue in the same way that the professionals I dealt with in this past week have. I am hoping I will continue to make strides in the right direction and that my sleep as it was will return with time and assistance. It's just crazy how these things can start out of nowhere. I hope that at least some people will read this through all the way and that it may help them or give them hope. If you have read this all, thank you. Any input would also be greatly appreciated. **TL;DR: Your insomnia may be due to an underlying psychiatric issue that's beyond your control. See a doctor. Get help. It will get better. There will be bumps in the road but it will get better.**
NotSignal	I'm curious if anybody hasn't slept yet. I'm struggling to sleep since I keep having sensations, my stomach just feels like the acid is gurgling.
NotSignal	We all know that blue light from modern LED displays makes sleep worse but I've just noticed that all the light bulbs in my home have LEDs inside :/ Google says that these too can cause trouble sleeping.I've just bought some old fashioned Edison type, low light filament bulbs, they give off a deep orange light, will see how I get on with them.
Signal	well, I don’t know what is going on. I’ve had problems with sleep for like four years, but if I got REALLY tired I was able to fall asleep in most cases. at this winter break, my sleep schedule became completely messed up (fell asleep at like 6-7am and woke up at 2-3 pm) now winter break is over, and for almost a week I can’t sleep even if I really want. I used to adapt myself to a new schedule easily(like I didn’t sleep for one night and then I fell asleep earlier and I woke up early too). but now I can’t. I want to sleep every day and when I go to bed this desire vanishes. I become bored with just laying, I suddenly sweat and then it suddenly gets cold, some weird thoughts go through my mind, I become thirsty and my lips get dry even if I apply literally a ton of Carmex on it.... I’m scared I will never be able to restore my sleeping regime😭
Signal	Pills aren’t working, different sleeping mechanisms don’t work, I’ve tried every possibility. But my body refuses to fall asleep, I’m sort of getting desperate and I just wanna know if there’s any other ways of sleeping that people tried out there. Thank you :)
Signal	I'm nineteen, and struggle with insomnia related to anxiety(I think). If I sleep say tonight, I will get up around 5 am no matter what and don't sleep the next night. Basically taking an all-nighter every other night. I have pretty good sleep hygiene, but after 3 am I pretty much give up and browse the internet or watch TV til the sun comes up. I usually read an hour or so before I feel tired. I've been to inpatient in the past for anxiety, but I am starting to think it's not related to anxiety and I'm just stuck or born sleeping like this. Am I wrong, I don't know what to do? I feel as if I've tried everything.Currently taking Venlafaxine XR and Gabapentin
Signal	Does anyone else experience debilitating, nausea inducing, drop to your knees Deja Vu when sleep deprived? It happens to me sometimes, (only got 2.5 hours of sleep last night) and it can be crippling. I’m trying to get through work today and I have to run to the bathroom when these waves hit as I feel like I might pass out or get sick. Even weirder are that the sensations are laced with images of dreams I had when I was asleep last night. It’s very unsettling and disturbing. Are these seizures? Or...? Am I losing it? I am a few weeks into CBT-i therapy and am definitely in the “it gets worse before better” stage...
Signal	I'm sure I'll now be up for several days straight, but I'm feeling amazing and cherishing the moment. I took 1.5mg Ativan and 100mg Seroquel and had an 11 hour sleep, woke for 2 hours, then took another 4 hour nap. Not much good in my life, so I'm just going to sit and zen :D
Signal	At least for me it helped tons, my 1yr apartment lease ended, while I was there I would get insomnia up to 3x per week, the walls where paper thin and I would constantly get anxiety from my neighbors noises, especially the one below me where he would order a hooker at least 1x a week and moaned all night long that chit was traumatizing, now I live in a large cottage with a huge garden and no neighbors, sleep like a baby.
Signal	Five and a half years ago I had insomnia so bad that I was very delusional and psychotic. It took me 4 years to find the right meds that help. I really wanted to go the natural route but I was so sleep deprived that I struggled to retain the information from Sasha Stevens' The Effortless Sleep Method. I recently came across a podcast where she was a guest speaker. She assures people that nothing is broken in people's brain that keeps them from sleeping. Hearing that again now that I'm stabilized on meds was enough for me to sleep 2 night without my meds. You have to remember that sleep is natural for everyone, even those suffering with insomnia for 30+ years. To those wondering I've stabilized on 10mg of Zyprexa and 600mg of Gabapentin. Neither are traditionally for sleep, so if you've tried everything else and are wondering if anything can help then you might ask your doctor about those medications--they come with minimal side effects for me. If you're drowsy the next day then you just have to get used to it, it subsides. Good luck, and work on your sleep hygiene!
Signal	To add onto my trouble falling asleep because of insomnia, I’m having nightmares lately. Probably since July. To the point where I wake up and run out of my bedroom heart pounding, scared to death of something. Last night I felt like something tried to drag me out of bed, but it was in my dream. I dreamt it. And I wake up already getting out of bed and leaving my room. I don’t wake up and then do that, I wake up as I’m in the process of getting out of bed and then I run or hurry out of my bedroom down the hall until I fully realize I’m awake and was dreaming. Sometimes I go back and crawl into bed, passing back out easily. Others like last night I had to walk to the kitchen to chill, then go turn my light on, turn it back off, get into bed, and still wasn’t calmed down. Took me another hour or two to fall back to sleep and when I did I had more nightmares but not the kind that make me physically scared when I wake up. My parents almost think it’s funny and aren’t taking it seriously but I’m afraid to sleep now. I talked to my therapist about it briefly when I was still going and she didn’t have much to say. Ugh. I’m at my wits end here.
NotSignal	Just so you get the full picture I live in an RV park and a campers walls are very thin. So it's 11 pm and my neighbors have now had there loud horrible Mexican music blasting for hours. There only two spots down from me so it's loud enough to keep me awake. As if I don't already have enough trouble sleeping as it is. On a normal night it takes me hours of staring at the ceiling to get to sleep and now I have to deal with this 😑. 😴
NotSignal	The last couple of weeks, my body has woken at 2:30 am, with my brain just completely awake. It's literally impossible to go back to sleep. I'll lay there for over 2 hours and at best I get stuck in this weird twilight zone where my brain is resting but I'm not asleep. Some kinda semi conscious area. I mean I'll wake up multiple times before then, too, but that time is when my brain just jolts awake and there's no returning.
NotSignal	I woke up after 2 hrs of sleep and I’m jealous of my boyfriends snoring and the sleeping cats I’m snuggled between. I hate how I can feel the bags under my eyes forming
Signal	After my usual dose of 200mg trazadone, I repeated my dosage (don’t do this kids) about 4 times. StiLl AWaKe! Why are YOU?
Signal	I have an insomnia for 1 month now and i think i figured out what causes my insomnia because i feel so active in the night and getting tired in the morning, I also have an anxiety which prevents me from sleeping, I always force myself to sleep because as the time passes it makes me stress even more. The thing is that i can't solve any of my problems so i can't sleep everyday.
Signal	Hello. ever since early-2013 I have been getting sleep issues. in Feb. 2013, I noticed signs of not being able to fall asleep quickly. but I could still get refreshing quality sleep. then in May 2013, my sleep all of a sudden went downhill. I sleep for 9 hours and i wake up feeling as if I slept only 2 or 3 hours.in July 2013, on a random night, I slept normal. and after that my insomnia kicked back in and it's been like that for almost 7 years, 365 a year. in February 2014, my sleep quality went down a bit. it stayed that way for 5 years when in Jan. 2019 my sleep quality went down much further.my eyelids are now twitching all the time, and I am getting much lighter sleep relative to some years back when it first started. i have constant headaches / light headiness due to non-refreshing sleep. other info: in late 2012 I began abstaining from all sexual activity due to medical problems. could constant sexual abstinence be related to my deteriorating sleep? also: I had my vitamin D levels checked in 2018. they were 21 ng/ml. I have been on D3 supplements for about a month [5000IU] and there is no change in my sleep quality. I have tried rigorous exercise and changes in diet. but to no avail. can anyone give me their theories on what is wrong with me? thanks.
Signal	My sleep schedule has been terrible so I took a 5mg melatonin for the first time in my life at 1:30am last night. Within 30 minutes I felt drowsy but almost in a bad way, I felt lethargic and like I didn’t even have enough energy to talk and my stomach got upset.I got a good amount of sleep last night but have felt tired all day. However, it’s currently 7pm and Im starting to feel terrible, similar to how I felt last night. I feel like I have no energy, not even to talk, I’m very irritable, my stomach is upset, and I have no appetite.I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else and if it sounds like melatonin? I want to make sure these symptoms are most likely from the melatonin and not Covid. I saw online that 5mg is way too high of a dose so I figured I just took way too much last night. Has anyone else felt terrible the day after taking melatonin? Also, what are some things I could do to combat these side effects? I feel like i need caffeine badly but don’t want to upset my stomach more. Thanks!
Signal	hey guys for the majority part of my life i’ve had a mild insomnia with me. it has gotten worse over the past year and i seriously need help. i don’t feel i feel numb. my energy is at its lowest. i can’t stop thinking at night, i overthink my own breathing and get anxious if i’m not breathing right, i get super uncomfortable and my body starts getting very hot. i tired meditation, cbd oil, binaural beats from spotify, breathing techniques but at the end of the day i can’t sleep. please i need desperate help and i’m only 15 i need to sleep. 😣
Signal	I’m suffering through something (heartbreak) rn and I haven’t been able to eat or sleep much. I hadn’t eaten in 2 days and I’m surprised I haven’t had a migraine yet. My anxiety just eats at me and I just end up either with panic attacks or nightmares. My body isn’t responding well to the stress that I’ve been under for the past few days and I’m so tired... I at most have gotten 3 hours of sleep... idk what to do to help myself. I’m trying to get over it but it happened in a very unexpected way.
Signal	Been having some insomnia the past few weeks. Im a junior in college and I think the initial cause was stress and anxiety about schoolwork and finding a job/internship. But the most fucked up part is it feels like once it starts, it only gets harder to sleep. I literally am tired all day, waiting to sleep at night, then night time comes and I’m wide awake. I keep myself awake because of the anxiety i get by trying to force myself to sleep. I mean how fucked up is that? Some brief googling supported that feeling, as it said that it is a real condition that u give urself anxiety because you want to sleep so bad. Then the anxiety causes u to go into fight or flight, which obviously makes it impossible to sleep. That is just fucking cruel. Think maybe it also has to do with not smoking recently, although I smoked some bud last night and still no luck. Gonna try a Xanax tonight. I know from briefly surfing this subreddit that people strongly advise against benzos, but god damn i just need one fucking night. One fucking nights sleep and ill be ok. This is quietly one of the more fucked up things I’ve experienced. I would do anything to go back to before this when I could sleep normally, because I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this.
NotSignal	I’ve tried herbal shit in the past & hadn’t had much joy but heard this one is quiet good.
Signal	Hi there. Nearly every night for the past month or so I have fallen asleep at lets say 12am and then woken up at 12:30, feeling anxious, stressed and not recognising my life, having a bit of an out of body experience. It always happens 10-30 minutes after I fall asleep. I am thinking of going to the doctors about this but I’m not sure what to tell them and how they can help. If anyone has any advice or experience with this I’d greatly appreciated. Thank you all xx
NotSignal	# OPTIMIZE YOUR SLEEP HEALTH BY FINDING THE RIGHT FORMULASleep Study , Science of SleepFor years, researchers and doctor have recommended 8 hours sleep each night as general best practice to help the body and mind rest and recharge. Interestingly, more and more professor are also considering sleep quality to be of equal importance in repeating all benefit sleep has to offer. In fact, sleep quality may be a better indication of overall health, mood, and life satisfication than sleep quality. So how can you tell if you're getting the most out of your sleep?# MISSING THE MARKWhether it's quality or quantity, most Americans aren't reaching the suggested guidelines for sleep. around 32 percent of Americans don't get High-Quality sleep and many adults do not reach the suggested 7 to 9 hours per night, either as recommended by the National Sleep Foundation # AN EASY FIXIn some ways, improving the amount you sleep is easier than improving how well you sleep. To increase your nightly sleep quantity simply just go to bed at an earlier time and wake up later in the day if your schedule allow. Extending your sleep schedule by 30 minutes on either can make difference in how you awake in the morning.# FOCUSING ON QUALITYOn the other hand, time in bed doesn't always equate to time spent actually sleeping. Adding to this, the rise of electronic device in the bedroom other sleep-harming habit like smoking and drinking caffeine late in the day can lead to restless sleep and waking during the night. Not sure how well you're sleeping? High-Quality sleep includes this following• Sleeping at least 85% of the total time in bed• Falling asleep 30 minutes or less• Waking no more than once per night• Remaining awake for no more than 20 minutes before falling back asleep# EASY IMPROVEMENT To increase your sleep quality, focus on adding in a relaxing night time routine and removing any stimulants that may disrupt your sleep. For example take a warm bath or shower, read, drink herbal tea or quietly meditate before you turn off the lights. At the same time, you might cut out caffeine in the afternoon, say to that evening nightcrap. and don't forget to wear your Sleepmind device to give a better, deeper and longer night sleep.With these healthy habits in place, you'll be able to improve your quality of sleep and fewer disruption may improve quantity as well. So you'll wake up feeling energized in the morning
NotSignal	Just thought I'd share a little of my success. It's a phone version and I've found it immensely helpful in calming my anxiety brain without making my body tense. Anyone else tried it and found similar?
Signal	I’ve been taking 15mg Mirtazapine for sleep and it does seem to somewhat shorten the time it takes me to get to sleep, but I’m experiencing intense drowsiness during the day. It seems like the drowsiness last all morning and into the afternoon, finally going away around the early evening. I’m used to being tired during the day, by this is a different story. It seems to make me very slow at work and makes me a bit nervous to drive.Does this eventually go away? I’ve been on the mirtazapine for about a week and the drowsiness seems consistent. Does 7.5 mg work for anyone?
NotSignal	Someone just told me that high amounts of histamine in foods like spinach, tomatoes, citrus fruits can cause insomnia. "Histamine Intolerance" she called it. Anyone else hear this? I eat a large amount of these healthy foods on daily basis..thinking healthy food would help me sleep better.. I would be shocked to find out this could be a cause for my insomnia!
NotSignal	I haven’t slept AT ALL in about two days and I’m really weirded out because this is not like me. I do not feel tired at all, what’s this malarkey? 😭👀
Signal	Hi so my sleep schedule has been garbage which might be releated to this, but basically for like 2 weeks I used to go to sleep at like 6 am 8 am and waking up at 6 pm, but one day I felt super tired at 2 am and decided to go to sleep earlier, since then I keep naturally waking up after about 4 hours of sleep and I just can't go back to sleep to get more hours in, I'll just lay in bed for like an hour unsuccessfully. Can I do something about it?
NotSignal	I am so frustrated. I don't know what's happened over the past few years, but Ambien seems to be getting the same reputation as oxies or amphetamines or something. I have had insonmia my entire life, and the only thing that has ever treated it without making me drowsy upon waking is Ambien, 10mg, every day. I've been on it for 10 years and never had a problem. It used to be so simple to get, offered without asking even. Now, I find myself switching doctors every few months because they all try to get me to quit or give me an attitude about it that makes me feel shitty as if they're doing me this MASSIVE favor writing a script and they don't do refills unless I show-up and pay oh and also - has to be shrinks even though I have NO mental illness, when this could be done at the regular doc.Why is it so weird and complicated? I feel like I'm requesting heroin each time and get the look of: "wow, you poor loser" or get told off / scolded depending on who I speak to because like I said, I keep changing docs as it's embarrassing to go back to them after the whole debacle.BTW if anyone in the nothern NJ area can recommend a doc who won't make a stink about Ambien, please do...
Signal	School has always been a ptsd place for me.It started about 2 years ago when I was 13. I couldn't sleep when I thought the next day I have to go to school.Then it progressed...I was becoming desperate for sleep. But couldn't so I took naps around 10 pm to 11 pm and the next hours I was up all night. After a year, I couldn't even take naps, I was literally a walking zombie. Now I can't sleep whenever I think the next day I must go somewhere at a certain time. It doesn't even have to be related to school stuff. My brain is already damaged and percevies sleeping and waking up at certain times as a threat.I have no control over it.Someone please help me.I've tried relaxing sounds.They helped for a while but now they don't work as they used to. I feel like I'm forcing myself to sleep even tho I might be tired as heck. The next day my eyes burning, my body sore, my vision blurred...My brain and body just won't yield to me. I will get restful sleep only when I know the next day I'm not required to be somewhere.I don't even know how I lasted these 2 years and I don't think I will last any longer.This is so messed up.I just wish there was a 'sleep' button.I can't take this anymore.I can't take sleepless nights anymore.I'm becoming suicidal bc of this.P.S: I have dysfunctional af family. So no I can't seek any kind of professional help.
Signal	so i started sleeping again for 4-6 hours, not very restfull but yea, but ever since that i feel very exhausted on daytime and its really troubling me since im not rly able to do things like before..&#x200B;Anyone else experienced being even more tired after sleeping disrupted etc?
Signal	Tired of this sleepless hell. Just wish I could fall asleep and then die while asleep. You know you wish that sometimes too.
NotSignal	The thought of what I'm gonna do tomorrow is all I think about when trying to sleep, I haven't slept for 3 days now, how do I stop this?
Signal	This week has been the worst week ever for me in regards to sleep. I cannot sleep no matter how hard I try. Eventually after being up for several hours I’ll pass out and sleep for like an hour or two. The entire day my body is too tired to get out of bed for more than a few minutes at a time. Even if I’m extremely tired as soon as I lay down I’m wide awake. I’ve only gotten like 6-8 total hours of sleep this week in total. I’ve never had anything like this and sleeping meds don’t work. It’s next to torture and I’m considering going to the hospital since the nearest appointment is this Friday. Please let me know if you have dealt with anything similar or need more clarification. Thanks.
NotSignal	I share a bed with my boyfriend, and when I first moved in with him I would have the best sleeps of my life because his bed was the comfiest thing on earth. I’d be able to get in bed around 10 and then get super comfy and pass out within an hour, sleep pretty much through the night and then wake up and be so comfy and cozy that it would be nearly impossible to get myself up fast. In the last few months however, I have had the worst time ever trying to sleep. No matter which position I’m laying in, or how many pillows or blankets I have, what way I position them, etc, I can never stop tossing and turning and feeling sore and achey in my shoulders, neck and back. I’ve tried so many different blankets and sheets and pillows, down to no pillows and 1 blanket and literally everything in between and I cannot make my bed comfortable at all. I get in bed and just want to go back to the couch no matter how exhausted I am. I wake up before my alarm and am genuinely irritated that I still have time to sleep and don’t need to get out of bed yet. I hate being in my bed. Anyone else deal with this issue and know why the hell this started happening to me all of the sudden? Any tips?
NotSignal	Can someone who’s done CBTi successfully describe their experiences a little closer? E.g. Did you do it on your own or under a guidance of a specialist? How many hours of sleep did you initially get? Did you do it during your holidays or normal working time? How did CBTi affect your performance? Did you do anything else, like giving up coffee, meditation, etc.? And last but not least, when did you start seeing effects?Any contribution will be appreciated. I’ve been playing around with some CBTi techniques but haven’t been very rigorous about them. With a forth week of very poor sleep almost over, I’m ready for a more serious commitment.
Signal	I cant sleep without having these horrible dreams that make me feel scared and stressed. It ruins my sleep because I wake up restless and often feeling miserable. Its vivid and I just want to die I hate living
Signal	My doctor has tried trazodone, but since that wasn't working that well she prescribed me seroquel(quetiapine) 100mg. She also did it to see if my mood swinga would change because she thinks trazodone was playing a key part. All I'm wondering is how long should i stay on a antipsychotic? I heard long terms risks of Tardive Dyskinesia, but how long is long term? And has anyone done fine on antipsychotics for insomnia? Also let me know what you guys take.
NotSignal	Been having serious trouble sleeping for a week. A few years ago I had severe insomnia that lasted 5 or 6 months before I finally got a handle on it. While this bout has only been going on about a week, I'm fearful that it could spiral out of control like last time, when even a max adult dose of Ambien was only putting me to sleep for 2-3 hours. I tried making an appointment with my primary care doctor, but they were booked up for the next month. Luckily the sleep doctor who I saw a few times the last time I grappled with this had an opening. I'm hoping for a positive outcome, and wishing luck to all of you out there struggling with insomnia.
NotSignal	I tend to sleep maybe around 3-5 hours I wake up and go to the restroom and go back to sleep. Any tips to stay asleep for at least 8 hours?
Signal	For the beginning of the summer I would stay up pretty late, sometimes not going to bed til around 3 in the afternoon. Now that school is getting closer I'm getting worried that I'm not gonna be able to fix my sleep schedule in time for school. I've gotten to the point I'll fall asleep around midnight, wake up around 3-5 am, get exhausted at 4-6 pm, fall asleep then, wake up around 8-11 pm, then repeat.
NotSignal	so basically every day i stayed up an extra hour until finally i got myself to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 8 am, but not gonna lie, it's really boring, and i kind of got got used to the night when everyone was sleeping, and i can't even talk to my friends because they wake up at 6 pm, i thought I'd never say this but i regret fixing my sleeping schedule.
Signal	No matter what, I can never sleep for more than 6 hours. I've had a history of sleeping problems. (Going to bed really late. Pulling all-nighters) but I just recently fixed my sleep schedule. By doing an all-nighter. After years of trying. I go to bed early now, but the problem is I keep waking up too early. I want to sleep more. And I always get so tired during the day. Like super tired. I literally just keep dozing off. So lately I started going to bed even earlier than usual. Like at 8 PM or 9 PM. (Not 'cuz I want to. I'm just so tired so I fall asleep early). And then I wake up in the middle of the night. 2-3: AM. Which is 6 hours. So what is the problem. Am I going to sleep too early? I want to get a lot of sleep. Like at least 8-10 hours everyday. I don't want to wake up in the middle of the night. Even when I went to sleep at 12 AM or 2 AM. I keep waking up 6 hours later. Exactly 6 hours. I'm not even lying. It's literally accurate. It's exactly at 6 hours everyday 'cuz I check the time. Why can't I just get the extra 2 hours? Why do I keep waking up at the exact same time? 6 hours. It's weird. It's currently 5:40 AM. Woke up at 3 AM 'cuz I went to sleep at 9. So I slept for 6 hours. I want to fall back asleep, but I can't. Damn. It just keeps getting worse. I just want to sleep more. I'm 16 years old, btw.
NotSignal	I’ve been knackered all day. Aching, yawning just generally needing a good night sleep. I’ve drifted off about 3-4 times around 11pm but never for long. It’s now 3am and nothing is getting me to sleep. Why?
NotSignal	I remember reading this quote a while back and now realize how true it is. You WILL eventually go to sleep, but it won't be when and where you want it to happen. Today I literally passed out in my bed for three hours with my glasses on and my hands pressed against my glasses, slumped over. The result is the bridge of my nose is in horrible pain. I'll probably have bruises from it. I know that is dangerous and why I don't drive anymore. I seriously need some good sleep. Thinking about trying my old CPAP machine tonight to see if that will make any difference. Good luck to all you others struggling with the same issue!
NotSignal	or only on deep sleep? cause i dream but i feel like i am half awake it is so weird
Signal	Hey this is my first time posting but I'm getting a lot of anxiety and haven't been able to find much help.I typically sleep well and don't have any issues falling or staying asleep. Last week, I got my wisdom teeth removed and was given oxycodone for pain. Only took about 2 a day for 3 or 4 days.The last night that I took it, I couldn't sleep. Not just that I was having trouble sleeping or struggled to fall asleep. I couldn't sleep for one second all night. The next day was the same. Couldn't fall asleep for anything. Once I got to about 40 hours without sleep I took a bunch of Benadryl and was finally able to sleep through the night. Problem continued again the next night, even though I took Benadryl and Zzzquil. I'm starting to get a lot of anxiety and really need some sleep, but I legit can't. Should I go to a doctor or urgent care?I talked to my oral surgeon and they said it's probably just a side effect since opioids can mess with your sleep and I should just wait for it to wear off. But it's been 3 days now. I'm having a lot of anxiety about this though. I really need to sleep.Anyone had this issue after taking painkillers before? Has anyone heard of this? I've only heard of painkillers causing drowsiness, not the other way around. Should it have worn off by now?Thanks!
Signal	I've ended up sleeping really late (6-9 am) the past few days since my bedtime seems to be drifting.I woke up today at 5PM! this is getting really out of hand. I end up having an unproductive day, and once the social distancing lifts, i'll have to resume regular daytime schedule again.How do i normalise my body clock again? It would be tough falling asleep since i've just woken up a few hours ago.really need to reset my body clock before it gets too out of hand.
Signal	Can anyone recommend a sleeping tablet that helps with sleep maintenance (staying asleep). I am not interested in taking benzos. Thank you!
NotSignal	Anyone heard of this? Sounds very promising. My Dr just wrote me a script. Thinking of trying it out.
Signal	This all started a couple months ago. I had a test and a presentation the next day so I stayed up until 3am the night before to work. Wasn’t a big deal. For whatever reason that night I freaked out when I tried to sleep because I didn’t think I’d have enough hours to get enough sleep to do well. That anxiety led to me not sleeping for a single minute that night. Ever since that night I’ve been having issues falling asleep. Every night I get so anxious that I won’t be able to fall asleep again and I have so many problems sleeping now. There have been quite a few nights where I never slept at all and countless ones where I was only able to fall asleep at 4am for a quick nap. I’ve tried melatonin, Tylenol PM, different teas, meditation and breathing techniques but none of them work. I know anxiety about sleeping doesn’t help at all but I have no idea how to stop being anxious. It’s like the more anxious I am the less I sleep and the less I sleep the more anxious I am. It’s just a neverending cycle and I don’t know how to fix it.
NotSignal	Specifically **Hi guys what tends to trigger your sleep maintenance issues? For me, I find having exciting or emotional discussions - chats or online messaging with peers can really trigger me. Especially when I don’t have an appropriate wind down time.Keen to hear some so I can expand my caution range!
NotSignal	I listen to audio books when I go to sleep. I don't want to disturb others so need to use headphones. Do you use something you find particularly comfortable for bed? I'm assuming wireless is the way forward but I'm a side sleeper and they tend to be bulkier?Any help appreciated!
NotSignal	Can anyone else relate? Does your insomnia overlap with or stem from some other disorder? I received this diagnosis like an hour ago and I'm just trying to get all the perspectives I can. Thank you<3
NotSignal	I have serious skin conditions on my face, thus very very sensitive skin and since those pills act as potent antihistamines I'm scared that they're gonna sensitise my skin even more :(
Signal	Hello,Since the beginning of the pandemic, I've experienced terrible and constant insomnia. A few months ago, my doctor recommended gabapentin (dosage of 900 mg) and trazodone (150 mg), along with several herbal supplements (passionflower extract, valerian root, lemon balm), and melatonin as well. This combination has worked wonders for me and has allowed me to sleep restfully through the night.Unfortunately, I decided to use MDMA last Friday and my sleep has suffered significantly since. The regular dosages of my prescribed medications were not effective, and even after increasing each dose my 33% (1200 mg of gabapentin and 200 mg of trazodone), I still can't seem to get a grasp on my sleep.Besides time and exercise (which I do vigorously), is there any way I can recover quickly? I am no expert on the subject, but I am assuming the mdma interfered with my serotonin and GABA systems for the worse. Does that seem correct?Some supplements I've seen recommended are bacopa, NAC, L-theanine, 5-HTP, and L-tryptophan. I took 5-HTP and L-theanine along with my usual supplements and medications last night, but still have had difficulty sleeping.Any explanations or recommendations going forward would be greatly appreciated.
Signal	I figured I wouldn’t need my sleep meds tonight because I was up at 4:30am yesterday. It’s almost 6:00am now. Maybe I’m not an idiot, or at least not a complete one, but I should know better than to not take my prescriptions.I have been proven wrong again, but fuck it; we’re social distancing, and I haven’t left my apartment in over a week.
NotSignal	I think I’m reaching a point where I need to acknowledge that I only have a chance at sleep when in a bed alone. I already have severe bouts of insomnia, but my boyfriend snores to the high heavens and fidgets/takes up whole bed which just eradicates any possibility of sleeping.I feel a weird stigma about sleeping in a different bed, we’re in our late 20s and I feel like this is something old people do... but right now I can feel I’m having memory and mood issues due to lack of sleep so surely that’s more important.
Signal	Been up to long, still can't sleep, annoyed and lonely. Not much else beyond that, just needed to bitch about it.
Signal	Long time insomniac, trying to wean myself off medication. I was prescribed Seroquel for about a year and started building up a tolerance (nothing too crazy, just up to 150mg) and it had me feeling hazy the next day (and oversleeping). Been on Zyprexa for about a month and it works okay, but man I miss Seroquel comas. Tonight I forgot to refill my medication so I can’t sleep at all, and it has me reminiscing on how nice I felt waking up after a Seroquel sleep- no waking up in the middle of the night, no early morning waking, no restlessness- it’s as close to a coma as I think I’ll ever get. I could always ask my doc to make the switch back to Seroquel, but the haziness and oversleeping (and huge weight gain) aren’t a good look. But what I wouldn’t do for a dose of it right now :(
NotSignal	I hate what insomnia does to my eyes. After a sleepless night, even when I'm on one of those adrenaline rushes and I feel fine during the day, my painful eyes are a constant reminder that I had no sleep. I tried warm compresses, it helps a bit but only for a few minutes. Also I feel like everyone would notice and think I've been crying all day. Anyone have tips for this?
Signal	Ive beat myself up about my sleep for yearsEver since i can remember ive naturally stayed up later than everyone around me and I take longer to wake up in the morning than anyone around me.Ive tried many different tricks to sort the pattern out which has worked but every single time it gets ruined come the next few days by me staying up for longer than that maximum 16 that everyone on this planet who wants 8 hours sleep seems to abide by. I end up sacrificing sleep for awake time when at work but on holidays i sleep for my 8 hours and stay up for about 20 , waking up and going to sleep at different times every day.Am i a lazy sack of shit whose uncommitted to developing a circadian rhythm or maybe it is in my nature to be awake for a more prolonged period of time.This wasn't so much a plea for help but instead just a point i wanted to bring up, it doesnt seem out of the question that we arent all designed for the same amount of awake time just the same as we arent all designed for the same amount of sleep (which seems to be widely accepted )&#x200B;Has anyone here ever considered or read anything about this as right now i feel like one of the only people to consider this ? I haven't deep dived in my research but i really thought this would be more of a topic.&#x200B;Obviously the solution would be a difficult one as our days are only 24 hours and i still like my 7.5 - 8 hours sleep but atleast i may have identified the problem.Im quite entrepreneurial in nature and this is probably the path i will follow so there actually is potential for an open sleeping plan, its the commitment to other peoples sleeping patterns through work (so i can earn money to survive) that i think prevents you from doing this; or am i missing something ?
NotSignal	I have insomnia, and have done for some time, I’m currently changing some routines to try and help my sleep come naturally, my question is, seeing as it just come on one day, could it also leave one day and I resume normal sleeping habits? I see many posts about people having insomnia, but not too many about how people have recovered from it if they have.
NotSignal	I’ve been sleeping for two to three hours a night for as long as I can remember. I lay in bed and rest, but can’t fall asleep.
NotSignal	I've been seeing people using this cloudy inhaler on instagram, supposedly helps you fall asleep, just wondering if any of ya'll tried it?
Signal	Been awake since about 9 a.m. Friday. Unfortunately my doctor's office doesn't open until Monday, so I'm thinking of going to a convenient care clinic in the morning. Hoping they'll give me an RX. Furthermore, I'm hoping this isn't the start of a rollercoaster like the last time I experienced insomnia, about three years ago. That time it was the start of a five month hellride, where even a 10mg dose of Ambien (which my insurance only partially covered) was getting me only two hours of sleep. (About my doctor's office: Even if I'm able to get seen on Monday, the doctor I've been seeing retired, and the person I would have to see is a D.O., and D.O.'s (from what I hear) are wary of handing out scrips.)
NotSignal	I’d take a look at my watch every time I wake up which is several times a night. I don’t have trouble going back to sleep but I struggle with staying asleep.
NotSignal	Every night when I eventually fall asleep, I have these almost life like dreams that end up waking me up and fucking with my head. These dreams consist of just normal home life shit with a few abnormalities, like a skunk hanging out in the kitchen. I can tell if they're dreams sometimes by analyzing my vision. When I'm awake, my vision is utter shit. Visual snow, palinopsia, blue field entopic, the whole gang. In the dreams I am mostly free of that shit, so I guess that's good? Anyway this is annoying and I just wanted to know if it's normal or not after lacking good sleep for a while.
NotSignal	The chewables I’ve been taking worked at first. But they have stopped. They worked for a week but then they stopped. I want to RAM my Head into a fuckiNg wall so that I may become unconscious. Even worse no one believes me. “ItS tHe PhOnE” they say. “HavE You TrIeD (insert thing that don’t help).” I know they mean well but Jesus I want to be dead. Years of this nonsense and I’m treated like a tried fool. Even worse is that it’s been getting worse, causing school to get harder to deal with. My lust for death is unbearable. But I have no choice to trudge on.
Signal	Over the past couple of months I’ve had an exceptionally hard time sleeping. I’ve tried tea before bed, reading before bed, melatonin, even staying up over 24 hours and trying to fall asleep at my preferred time all to no avail. I partly blame my job, due to the fact that I have a very flexible schedule and can therefore nap whenever, and it involves me sleeping in different places. It’s an active job though and I’m starting morning college classes which means I really need to be getting the right amount of sleep at the right time. Does anyone have techniques that have helped them?
NotSignal	Naps are not a thing I do, so that isn't part of the problem. I hate naps, and am just as bad at them as I am about staying asleep.
NotSignal	i slept very well last night after i took a thc edible, are there any downsides to doing this? i loved it, had a good night and fell refreshed right now, is there anything other than tolerance that would be a downside?
NotSignal	My recent and ongoing insomnia spell had a very peculiar beginning. I've been feeling very productive and wanted to push out more productivity while I could and I always thought that having to sleep is such a bitchslap in the face. What a useless waste of time, right? So everytime I had to go to sleep I was feeling frustrated that my body needs a recharge and I have to wait till morning to resume with my projects. Then one night, not surprisingly, I couldn't sleep. The insomnia started gradually and I had a couple of days when I couldn't sleep or slept a little. Now I feel drained from insomnia and am actually pretty much rendered useless during the day but even though I want to return back to normal sleep - I can't. I don't even know how I am going to break this cycle this time - in the past when I had insomnia spells, I made a drastic change in environment (travelled somewhere for a week) and this helped me rebound. Now due to travel restrictions I cannot do this. Anybody else in the same boat with me?
NotSignal	I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post in (if anyone else can think of a better place lmk). For the past 2 weeks, I've found I have trouble falling asleep any day I go out biking. Days where I bike will result in me being unable to fall asleep until around 3:30 in the morning. I should note that I generally bike around 2-3 in the afternoon but find that my heart rate continues to be elevated for hours and I continue to feel warmer than usual after the workout. Has anyone else had this issue and if so, how did you manage it? I'll also note that on days I'm not biking, and instead are doing a more low-key workout, I'm able to get the normal amount of sleep I usually get nowadays and can fall asleep at my usual times.
NotSignal	I tried to get referrals to a psychiatrist for severe anxiety for sleep... NOPE! Insurance won’t approve it. Want meds for your digestive issues that are causing you rapid weight loss? NOPE! Insurance won’t approve it.I’m beyond pissed off....

NotSignal	I’ve had this before but Benadryl helped. It came back last night. I had been running on 3 hours of sleep. Worked all day. Came home. Got in bed before midnight. And sure enough as I started to relax I could feel my limbs going numb and my body too. It got to a point where I was even conscious during REM. Around 1 am I found my Benadryl. Around 2 or 3 I started writing a message to my friend describing what was happening. I didn’t finish it and must have finally fallen asleep though it took time. I woke up at 11am late for work and they were freaking out. Got to work by 12 and got home around 6. Now I’m scared of it happening again so I took Benadryl early just in case. Around 12 I’m in bed and start trying to drift off. But here we go again. It’s the weirdest feeling. My brain is just stuck in limbo as my body goes on autopilot sleep mode. I try to find something to think about to ignore it but it’s hard. I was getting sweaty and my nerves were tingly. Now I’m laying here with AC set lower hoping I drift off soon. I’m looking at 6 hours right now which is my norm. But I don’t know if I’ll make it. I just want to know if anyone else experiences this. It’s such a bizarre feeling.
Signal	I suffered with insomnia for 4/5 months and since I started this medication over a month from now I am so much better. I was on 15ug but down to 7.5ug now and it is still effective. I plan to stop taking it in a couple of weeks! still have the odd bad night, but I have much better sleeping habits and I will continue to be disciplined. I urge anyone with insomnia to try it👌🏻

NotSignal	i dont really feel any withdrawals when i stopped taking.i take it like 2days then 3 days off and never felt any withdrawals,and i am on tramadol aswell for 5years now 250mg day.i thought maybe tramadol blocks the withdrawal effects of zoplicone?
Signal	another shitty night, fell asleep fairly fast slept for2.5 hours, woke up and couldnt get back to sleep.I feel like a zombie slowly.Sometimes i manage to get 6 hours of sleep(1-2 a week, but not 6 hours at once) and sometimes 4 sometimes 2 or even less, its really working me up.. All happened 3 weeks into quarantene since im not going out as much anymore,or barely even leaving the house. I don't wanna take hard meds.What herbal meds do you recommend? im pretty tired at night, but should i stay up even more to secure the sleep maybe?(didnt try that yet because i feel like resting when i get somewhat tired)sorry for ranting again lol..
Signal	Hey everyone 😊 so I’ve taken nytol (diphenhydramine) many times in the past, sometimes I’d take 2/3 pills and enjoy the relaxed feeling it gave me. Last night I took 2 pills as I’ve been struggling to sleep recently and I had a reaction to it that I’ve never had before! It came on suddenly, out of no where I had a bad feeling of impending doom, my pupils were huge and my whole body was violently shaking. I went to lie down hoping I could relax, I could feel my heart pounding and I was seeing wiggly lines and dots everywhere. I had to keep telling myself that the feeling would pass. I was close to calling my mum because I thought something was going seriously wrong with me. I’ve never ever had that kind of reaction to it before and am baffled as to why this happened. It’s put me off for life! The only thing I can think of is that I now take 200mg lamotrigine and this is the first time I’ve taken nytol since being on the lamotrigine. Anyone had similar experiences from a relatively low dose of nytol?
NotSignal	For this entire month, I keep waking up at midnight.I always sleep early at 8 or atleast 9 but for some reason, I keep waking up at midnight and never fall asleep again.I've been taking my meds for hypothyroidism daily but to no avail.I feel like my insomnia will only get worse from here on out.
Signal	Hey guys, I know their are tons of posts on here probably with suggestions, but at this point I'm having an extremely hard time and really just need someone to talk to who understands. I used to have some sleep problems, but during quarantine it has gotten severe. I now meet the requirements for clinical insomnia, and haven't been able to sleep in what feels like a month (if I do it's only a few hours at a time). My insomnia is affecting me mentally, but also physically as well. I'm supposed to start working again tomorrow, and I'm worried I truly won't even have the ability to do it (I'm a nanny so it's nothing too intense, but I still am responsible for a child and can't be completely out of it). I don't know if anyone else has dealt with this, but I think I truly have a fear of sleep. I know it's pathetic but I have cried many times even just thinking about sleep, and have panic attacks every time I try to. Even just today my roommate was taking a nap, and I started getting so overwhelmed and frustrated because I'm completely exhausted and frankly I was jealous. I had some doctors I was talking to (a psychiatrist and psychologist) but they wanted to refer me out, which I was okay with, but then they completely stopped responding. They're apart of my college's campus health program, so will refer out is they're not confident treating the issue. I'm so desperate for anything that could help... particularly if anyone has dealt with bipolar disorder and insomnia and has any tips it would be much appreciated. I feel like I'm going completely crazy and am getting so physically sick that I could end up in the hospital soon.
Signal	i was recently prescribed Belsomra to help me sleep. in addition to all the other bad side effects i've noticed myself crying for no reason on it - i don't know if this is due to the medication or something else, but can anyone relate?
NotSignal	I usually can't sleep earlier than 1 a.m. and can't wake up later than 5:50 a.m.I never can sleep good in a others bed. Just like Hotels, Hostels or even friends.I am always fearing the waking up.I probably also have depression.I get disturbing when tired.I can't seem to feel awoken.
NotSignal	My sleep is such a mess lately, I try to sleep and in “good days” can sleep for 3-4 hours then if I wake up and try to sleep again, I’m just unable to go back to sleep even if I lay in bed with my eyes closed for 3 hours straight. Also even while I sleep I’m constantly waking up every hour.I don’t know what to do anymore.
Signal	okay so i went to the doctors like a week ago and told them how i had trouble sleeping. anyways doc didn’t appreciate the weed smoking and instead gave me sleeping pills (hydroxyzine hcl 50mg). anyone used these before?
NotSignal	Hi, I'm a 22 year old girl, not officially diagnosed with insomnia, but that is why I am here; to determine if my situation sounds similar enough to talk to my doctor about it. So, I'm aware of insomnia's typical grasps and ways, and the people I know who are diagnosed experience it pretty similarly to each other. For me, legitimately the hardest part about sleeping is actually preparing to go to sleep. When I get to sleep, I sleep fine! I basically *never* wake up again through the night until it's morning. But preparing to sleep is a different story. I am immediately plagued every night with ridiculous itching everywhere, soreness laying almost any way, I close my eyes and they almost automatically open again. For the itching, I know it's not my detergent or sheets or anything, it happens no matter what bed I am sleeping in or which sheets I've switched to. For the soreness, I've tried a few different kinds of mattresses; soft, firm, etc., with little to no difference. Could this qualify as a symptom of insomnia? Or am I just unlucky? I'm already taking medication for itchiness, so besides that I'm not sure what to do. TL;DR: I suffer extreme itchiness every night, muscle soreness nearly no matter how I'm laying, and the inability to keep my eyes closed when going to sleep. Could this be insomnia related? Thank you!
NotSignal	So this may partly be a genetic thing as several people in my family have pretty pronounced eye bags. My eye bags didn't get super bad till I had a very bad experience on weed that sent me into a panic attacks for two hours and then gave me severe anxiety and insomnia for the next following 6 months after, and slowly things started to get better. My sleep finally seemed to be getting back to the quality it used to be and then one lousy night a couple weeks ago sent me back into the severe insomnia phase again for like a week, and now when I get 7-8 hours of sleep I wake up with my eyes feeling dry. The thing is I sleep mostly on my left side and the eye bag is more pronounced on this side than the other. When I look in the mirror I get pissed because the one side on my left side of the face looks almost exhausted like I have not been sleeping well, but it sort of over all looks like it, even though I don't feel that tired. My eyes are always feeling dry though. I'm not sure if I'm reading into this too much, also after 8 hours of sleep my fitbit says my sleep score was fair, like usually it's 75, but apparently most people score from 75-83, and 83 is considered good but on the lower end of good. I guess I'm confused about my quality of sleep and annoyed about the eye bags. Anyone else get this?
Signal	My insomnia seems to be improving a little bit (yay) but I still wake up every few hours and dream quite vividly so it seems like I’m sleeping incredibly lightly when I am asleep. Anyone else get this as well? Any tips for staying asleep throughout the night? I’ve tried a lot of different supplements and a few different sleeping meds but they only make me more tired and sleepy but don’t actually knock me out.
Signal	For the first time in about 2 years i got to sleep 2 nights in a row with only 1 small dose of clonazepam :D. Admittedly, was only 2 hours ish a night but imo is a BIG step in the right direction, and am buzzing, didnt really know where else to post or who else to tell.
NotSignal	My greatest problem falling asleep is anxiety. I fidget because I worry about my sleeping position and I worry about the sleep I'm not getting.You've probably heard this a million times before but finding an optimal amount of time to stop trying to fall asleep and do something else like reading really helps. I get stubborn and stay in bed for hours sometimes, or ill get too impatient and get up every 10 minutes (too short for me). Personally I like to give sleeping 20 minutes and if that doesn't work ill read for 5-10 minutes, but I encourage you to really experiment to find what works for you.If you're going to read I recommend reading in the dark and getting a reading light that isn't too strong and has a warm (orange) setting. Best of luck!
NotSignal	Your math skills sharpen because you spend all night calculating how much sleep you'll get if you're able to "fall asleep right now"
NotSignal	I feel like I am intruding on sacred ground here, but I want to say it.I'm not an insomniac in the sense that I cant sleep how much ever I try. Or that I sheep for an hour and feel okay.I'm addicted to not sleeping. I would think it is about a specific show I wanted to binge. Or even wanted to jack off or play dota late into the night. But its none of that. I quit one and just do another. It feels like, I would rather watch a documentary about Squirels addicted to Xanax, but narrated by someone doing a bad Donald Trump impression, and it's animated in the style of Big Mouth. And the script is by 3 year old Niece.I would watch Youtube videos, but boring 10 minutes one for hours on end. Rather than sleep. I hate it. But it always draws me in. One fucking video my ass.I hate waking up at 12 PM, not feeling remotely rested. I hate that my body is so fucked up that I dont think to call or text my friends. I hate that I use a day of good work as an excuse to not sleep.I had not reading my body signs. When it's clear at 12am I am not sleepy, why am I awake at 4pm, no mood to sleep?
Signal	How I 'Cured' 6 years of Chronic Insomnia and a dependence on sleeping pillsTo my dear Insomniac friends,I'm writing this in the hope that it can help anybody who has or is experiencing chronic insomnia and who has been unable to 'fix' it.On this subject, I could write for a very long time so I can only apologise for the length and rambling nature of this message!To start with, I will write a brief history of my experience with Insomnia so that those who are reading can see if it has any similarities with their own struggle.My insomnia started, much as it does for many people, when a few things in my life were not as I wanted: my brother was sick, my grandfather was dying and I had just started a new job that I quickly realised, had been a career mistake. I was stressed. This type of life situation would reasonably warrant an individual losing some sleep. It was however, my reaction to this situation that caused my insomnia to have a hold on me for as long as it did.The first thing I did was to buy the sleeping aid Nytol, an antihistamine available over the counter in the UK. After this quickly stopped working I moved on to prescription sleeping pills provided by my doctor. These provided temporary relief. Once these were no longer available I made the biggest mistake of my life and obtained Diazepam, and not through my doctor. The sad fact is that Benzodiazepines are highly effective at providing sleep to you when you desperately want it. Because of that, they are highly addictive. This started a process whereby I couldn't sleep without taking something. I tried many different substances to help me sleep and spent the next six years battling a dependence on sleeping pills and the resulting grogginess I had to endure when I took them. Things became desperate. I don't want to bore you with the over dramatic details!During this period I tried everything I could in order to fix my insomnia:Counselling, Hypnosis, meditation, CBT, antidepressants (all of them), natural remedies, sleep hygiene, every sleep inducing substance I was able to get my hands on, etc.The simple fact is that if you are unfortunate enough to stumble down this road you do two things: create fear around sleep and the lack of it, and create the belief that you cannot sleep without taking a sleeping pill.Whilst some of the above mentioned therapies did help me to varying degrees, my own solution lay outside of what I have mentioned.The most important aspect of over coming Chronic, fear based Insomnia, is Acceptance. This is the most important thing you can do and it isn't talked about enough. Chronic Insomnia is really just the fear of not sleeping. Remove that fear and you no longer have insomnia. Not sleeping isn't pleasant (believe me, I know!) but is it as bad as you think it is? The answer is no. When I have not slept all night, do I feel rubbish? Yes. Will I cope the following day? Absolutely yes. Will it be all fun and games? No. 1. Accepting that you will sleep when you are tired enough2. Worrying about sleep will only make your insomnia worse3. Accept lying in bed when you are awakeA great book on this is by Chris Winter 'The Sleep Solution'.Now for me the greatest issue I had with lying in bed awake at night was the anxiety it provoked. Worrying about the following day, worrying about whether I would cope with the responsibilities I had, dragging up every negative memory I can remember from my life etc.This is where I stumbled upon the second thing I want to suggest, and this is if anxiety is one of the reasons you cannot sleep: Propranolol. A simple beta blocker. Now, ideally I wouldn't be taking any substance to influence my sleep. However, clearly anxiety is a severe issue for me and of all the substances I could be taking to help me sleep, Propranolol is seemingly, the most benign. And it is important to note that Propranolol is not sleep inducing. For me personally, it stops the physical symptoms of anxiety that can cause major issues when trying to sleep: tight chest, racing heart etc. Propranolol allows me to lie in bed awake and not find that experience unpleasant:This is crucial.I still have the odd poor night of sleep but by changing my mindset and using Propranolol to control physical symptoms of anxiety the entire experience is completely manageable. There is much more I could write but to keep this post as succinct as possible I will say that Attitude and Propranolol are the things that have saved me from six years of despair and suffering. I've slept 6-8 hours for the last 2 months and I honestly thought that would never be possible.I'll leave it there. I hope that helps and best of luck to anyone struggling with Insomnia. (I will also obviously add that Propranolol was prescribed to me by my GP and as I am not a doctor, this is not medical advice.)
Signal	This is a little weird but does anyone else see some faint lights when you close your eyes after taking trazodone? I’m currently taking 25mg at night to combat insomnia. Can trazodone affect vision or cause visual disturbances or am I just imagining this? It still typically knocks me out though.
NotSignal	I would like to have facts or information on what happens to your body and mental state when you don’t get enough sleep.
NotSignal	I could see if it was part time and the work days have off-days in between, but the average person can’t survive with such pitiful income. For full time however, you don’t have insomnia-recovery days as the work days are consecutive and thus allows no room for sleepless nights. So your options are either go to work and perform poorly due to lack of sleep and risk getting fired from stupid mistakes or call off/come late and also risk getting fired because happens regularly.This whole thing is fucked.
NotSignal	Why can’t my brain just let me go to sleep. Gotta wake up in 3-4ish hours and I haven’t gotten a second of sleep tonight. Ugh!
NotSignal	Sup boizI used to work a nightshift job and would regularly stay up 28+ hours It’s been a while since I did that and now I have a normal person job, and all this quarantine shit had destroyed my sleeping, I’ve been up for like 15 hours now and I’m about to go back to work, in approximately 30 mins... to do a full dayCan’t sleep at all but feel like walking EbolaThe fuck am I gonna do pls
Signal	So I don't know what to do. I've been working 9pm till 7am everyday 5 days a week I just started this new shift like a month ago and it was fine and my sleep was ok till this week. Every day when I came home to sleep I was finding it harder to pass out so I had to start taking melatonin and it went from passing out at 8am to struggling at noon! It has gotten worse so I had to call into work tonight because I was awake from 6pm yesterday till 11pm the following. I fell asleep finally but woke up wide awake at 4am! I'm losing my mind and frustrated beyond belief. I took a melatonin a it isn't working and just feel restless. I'm supposed to take my wife out for a date all day today and I'm afraid my sleep will sabotage it because I get cranky with no sleep. Please if any has any advice please tell me.
NotSignal	Please help, r/antipsychiatry and r/radicalmentalhealth are two communities that DENY THE EXISTENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS and harm vulnerable mentally ill people by lying about medications being harmful. Please help me take them down and spread the word. Help me stop this scientologist cult.
NotSignal	so I stayed up 4 nights in a row. finally got a couple a couple of hours in and then woke up, and couldn’t fall asleep for another two days. this just keeps repeating. i’ve tried all the over the counter medications. i need something stronger
Signal	I have ADHD. On occasion (more frequently lately) I have a hard time settling down for bed. My Psychiatrist gave me Xanax for anxiety as needed, but then when I started having trouble sleeping he told me to use a Xanax. Yes, he told me I cannot daily or even frequently. He said 1-2x per week is fine. Yesterday at my appointment I told him I wanted something different for sleep that I could use as needed. He suggested Trazodone, Gabapentin, or Clonidine. I told him I didn't have a preference, so he gave me Trazodone. My Gawd. This was the worst idea EVER! He said to take 1/2 the tablet (25mg) 30 minutes before bed and if I still did not feel tired to take the other half. It definitely did not make me drowsy. In fact...I slept way worse. I had a headache within 10 minutes of taking, and I was wide awake. I would dose off on occasion but then wake up again for long periods. This morning I did some research and it seems like this drug needs to be taken daily to help you sleep not PRN (as needed).
Signal	(sorry this post is so long, it’s a bit of a rant. but if you could read it and if possible offer some advice, i’d appreciate it a lot)TRIGGER WARNING: sickness/vomitingOn the night of Thursday the 6th, I didn’t manage to sleep until almost 5am and therefore got under 3 hours of sleep. I’ve had all nighters and still gone to school before, but the sleep deprivation has never made me physically ill. The nights before Thursday during this week and probably before that as well consisted of only 4-6 hours of sleep and this severe lack of sleep that has built up either directly caused me to become violently ill, or weakened my immune system enough that I quickly became susceptible to the flu/a flu like illness. On Friday, I woke up at 7am feeling lightheaded and in a daze, with a pounding headache and a bit sick to my stomach. I ended up having to miss school since I could barely walk in a straight line and every step hurt more than the last. I went back to sleep for a few more hours, waking up at around 12:55, and the whole rest of the day I couldn’t even keep water down. Even after having yet ANOTHER 5 hour nap starting just before 5pm and feeling a bit better, I tried to eat some buttered bread and a cup of water but I still threw it back up. The whole day was absolute hell for me, and I really don’t ever want to have to go through it or anything like it ever again. Although I’ve been sick for longer periods of time before I’ve never felt quite that sick, and I know that that is because of the sleep deprivation. The whole time, I was thinking “this ought to be enough to shake you out of it; if THIS is what your sleep deprivation caused you, you can’t honestly end up staying up that long again when you know what happens to you for it”. Welp, turns out, I STILL can’t sleep. I know recovering from insomnia is an overnight thing but when it’s JUST caused me so much pain, I thought maybe that’d somehow scare me back into rhythm. I guess what I’m trying to say is that not even being violently and painfully ill can throw my sleeping back into rhythm, so I’m terrified of what health complications insomnia could throw at me in the future and I don’t know what to do about it. I haven’t been able to get professional help for it because I’m still building up the courage to talk to my parents about it, but without that kind of help, how bad is this going to get and how much longer can I keep it under wraps?
NotSignal	For these years, I accepted my insomnia and live with it. I started to work at night. But now it is gone. I can work in the day. I want it back because I currently working from home and the cooking odor from my housemate. It is only at the night can help me focus.
Signal	Hi, 19F here Ive completed As in 2019 and am currently waiting for uni to start in sept. Background : I was diagnosed with anxiety and sleep disorder in July last year in the middle of exams period. Sat out of the rest of it when I realized how severe it was getting after the very first episode (will go without sleep for days). I started to seek professional help from the psychiatrist and therapist during the preparation of As and took cocktails of sleep and anxiety-coping medication. After As ended,my parents didn't want me to take those medication anymore as they did not want me to be over-reliant on them. So at the start of 2020, I decided to stop taking my medication. There would be some days where I could sleep but for the most part,I'd still have sleepless nights and restless sleep. *Also , I stopped seeing the psych when As ended as my parents deemed academics to be responsible for my issues and that I can practice to sleep on my own(they are full on skeptics and the type who will tell you ,"just don't think about it") Its now may and I worry that I won't be able to cope with uni esp with this sleep issue. It jacked up my preparation for As(it was really torturous) and I don't want it to ruin my uni life. I don't know what I should do… I've talked to a friend about this situation but I think both of us don't know what to do in this situation.*I've tried over-the-counter melatonin but it doesn't work and makes me feel even more awake for some reason
NotSignal	Everyday when I go sleep, my body twitches when I try to fall asleep. I lose about 6 hours of sleep. I don’t know is this anxieties or something else. What should I do?
Signal	My eyes sting and I'm so tired but every time I start to drop off to sleep I wake up with a start/jump. I am so tired. I don't understand.
NotSignal	i’ve been up for 2 days and i cant fall asleep, i don’t know why!!! i do have insomnia but it’s never this bad, i can only fall asleep now if i’m high or on something. The thing is i still feel energized everyday and do everything i’d normally do but slightly better, i feel like somethings wrong with me, has anyone experienced this??
NotSignal	I had a friend that is also an Insomniac recommend this and HOLY SHIT. It worked too well. I had the deepest 13 hour sleep of my entire life. In fact it worked WAY TOO WELL. I slept through all of my alarms and had to call out of work. I couldn’t even just go in late because this shit left me so drowsy that working customer service in that state would have gotten me fired and the drive to work would have gotten me killed.There really is no way around this condition is there. About the only upside to this is that I had some good dreams. Good dreams that cost me an $80 shift. Never taking that shit again. Unless of course Im really dying of insomnia and have no obligations the next day. Oh well, heres to going back to 72 hours of no sleep at a time.
Signal	I’m always on the brink of falling asleep but I answer happens. I look outside my window, it’s around 1 am. So it’s black. I close my eyes and try to fall asleep, until I, got some treason, get up and look out the window again. It’s blue, and it’s 6 am. I am really concerned as this has almost been going on for 3 days and I just want to get my circadian rythym back together. Any tips on how to get the circadian rythym together? I’ve tried melatonin and sleepy time but I always end up sleeping on the couch for 10 minutes 5 times at 3 pm.
NotSignal	Guys!! I’ve just had 2 nights in a row where I got 6+ hours sleep!! And I’m pretty sure one of those nights I got 7 hours!! Compared to how my sleep pattern has been going lately that is really good for me and I’m so so happy about it!! Tonight isn’t looking too great for getting a good nights sleep but I’m trying to stay optimistic and remembered how good the sleeps I started getting this week were!! They felt so long!!
NotSignal	Just when I thought I had this all under control . I was drinking tea, got new comfortable sheets and I even cut back on the caffeine.I learned today before work that I lost my grandfather at 95 years old. I was told he wasn’t going to make it through the night, but I held out hope knowing how strong he was . Losing him has to be one of the arrest things I’ve had to face and not I can’t get my mind to quiet down enough to even get some sleep. It’s also probably the stress of not knowing of my job will let me go to the funeral. Pleas I just want to smile and get some sleep
Signal	Posted in this sub before but my insomnia came back really bad so here I am again to vent because holy shit, I am so frustrated and scared.Some backstory: on Tuesday I woke up with pain in my lower right side and overall I felt unwell. I already had a doctor's appointment that day so I figured I'd bring it up when I got there. After examining me she told me she wants me to go to the ER to get checked for appendicitis. Some tests and lots of waiting later and I get told I need to stay overnight because they want to monitor me and see if I get any worse or better. They weren't sure if it was appendicitis because while my appendix looked fine, I had an elevated white blood cell count and it hurt when they pressed on where my appendix is. I couldn't sleep well at all that night and I assumed it was from the stress. I had very vivid 'dreams' the moment I closed my eyes but I never drifted into actual sleep. I was still awake, but in a weird state where I was just starting to dream. I would jolt awake after a few minutes of hearing and seeing shit, usually my leg or arm will jerk and I'm suddenly fully conscious again. After dealing with this for about an hour I eventually gave up and decided to stay up until I passed out. Ended up not sleeping at all apart from two, quick 30 minute naps. Morning comes and they tell me if I can keep food down I'm probably fine bc it turns out I had a little stomach bug that happened to look like appendicitis at first. They give me medicine to help my constipation and advice for my stomach pain and nausea. I honestly don't remember what they said exactly but something like that, I was so tired from not sleeping I tuned a lot out.Didn't get home until 3 pm and I passed out right then, slept 5 hours all the way through and woke up to eat and drink. Didn't feel tired after eating so I decided to just sleep when I felt tired again. Later that night I had the vivid dream shit again and couldn't sleep so I became stressed. Eventually fell asleep for real but woke up 30 mins later with nausea and I puked my guts out. Felt better after that and fell back asleep no problem but kept waking up every 1-2 hours. I slept about 9 hours but it was very fragmented. Now I'm awake at 4:30 am with the same issue again: Every time I try to sleep I start to feel weird, sometimes I feel like I'm floating and other times I don't, mostly I just 'hear' things and my thoughts are very jumbled and what I see and hear is very vivid and usually scary, and then I jolt awake. I'm extremely frustrated and stressed over this, especially since I was never getting good sleep before this happened and I'm worried I'll never get good sleep again and I'll just stay awake until I die. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so of course I'm scared I have something (read about SFI once so of fuckimg course I'm scared this is what it is even though I know it's basically impossible). Obviously I'm having problems sleeping because I'm not feeling good and it should pass once I'm better, but my stupid anxious brain won't listen.Has anyone else experienced these vivid dreams? If so, how do you get yourself to stay asleep? Thankfully I have a follow up appointment with my doctor later today so I'll be sure to bring up the insomnia but holy fuck I feel like I'm going insane. I'm so tired and I feel like I have to fight to just get a few hours worth of sleep.And for anyone wondering: I don't plan on taking marijuana to help me sleep (I don't even know where I'd get it) and melatonin doesn't help. I think the only thing that makes me feel sleepy is chamomile tea but it doesn't help me /stay/ asleep. Any advice would help, I feel like I'm losing my mind here
Signal	Earlier this year I started antidepressants (lexapro) for my anxiety. i've been having horrible night cold sweats where I wake up drenched and freezing. Sometimes enough to get up and change my clothes. Additionally, I'll wake up at 4am like clockwork. My anxiety kicks in and then I'm up for 2-3 hours. But hey, at least I'm dry again. Doc has upped the meds (to fight the anxiety) and then changed the meds to Zoloft (to fight the night sweats). Bought a cooling weighted blanket, which I love the feeling of, and had a couple so-so nights where I got up for the bathroom and went back to sleep. But now I'm back to the night sweats. Waiting another couple months to change meds again, but have also been told to stay melatonin.37F, blood work is normal. Anyone have luck with solves for the night sweats? Or experience with antidepressants and sleeping?
NotSignal	I feel like I need to just force myself to be awake now until it's nighttime again so that I don't fuck up my sleep schedule but got I feel like trash. I have pretty bad anxiety and it's just so hard to cross over into dream land at night. I'm having a bad episode of insomnia, anyone have suggestions?
NotSignal	Sometimes I wish I had Insomnia. I dont know why. I know that's messed up and I shouldn't want it and if I had it I'd hate it. But why am I so interested in experiencing it. Like physically not being able to sleep and craving sleep but not being able to get it. I dont know. Same with sleep paralysis sometimes. Wish I could experience it. Anyone else have anything else like this at all. Or anyone know maybe why I think and feel like this?
Signal	I’m just curious if anyone has experienced something similar. From May - mid July I didn’t sleep. It’s like my brain forgot how to fall asleep. I would just lay there, all night. It was so incredibly painful. I was also very depressed. My brain started to have micro sleeps and I would sleep for an hour close to the morning out of pure exhaustion. I could barely function, felt like I was having psychosis. I had memory loss, trouble speaking, extreme anxiety, and confusion. Now I’m sleeping after seeking a psychiatrist but I’m still suffering from severe memory loss. Any one know what caused my brain to randomly STOP sleeping?
NotSignal	What I’m about to say may sound terrible and is very unfortunate but, I’m glad this subreddit exists. It feels good knowing I’m not alone. I’m sure it helps other in the same way too. Keep up the good fight fellow insomniacs. Hopefully we all get to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
NotSignal	I know this might be a dumb question but I need a well-elaborated answer that will be clear to me and others who see this.
Signal	For the longest time I managed to get enough zzz that I could manage, especially with naps here or there, but I can’t do that anymore. I have zopiclone for sleep and before this year I could count on one hand how many times I used them to sleep because I know sleeping pills have too much risks attached. However this year my chronic pain got worse, depression worsened, and I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t lay down for naps or sleep at night. I managed it by benedryl and gravel mostly because I’m allergic to melatonin. Last week I started a new treatment protocol that means I have to drive 40 minutes to a hospital every day for an hour treatment then home, I’m always under slept and I can’t sleep at all unless I take the zopiclone, it’s like my body is craving that deep sleep and doesn’t want to settle for anything less. So I’m not going to take anymore of this kind, but I need advice on other medications to try, I NEED this treatment protocol to work but if I can’t sleep I will burn out extremely fast and it will be detrimental to me. I’m also heading into code red season, increased chronic pain, stiffness, extremely high cptsd issues, and that all with no sleep is dangerous. Any real tips would be greatly appreciated. Just to add, I’m allergic to melatonin and pot (including cbd)
NotSignal	I’m not sure if I’m just “that age” or have a sleeping disorder. I stay up until all night constantly, usually sleeping from 12-5 PM. I don’t use any sort of medication that would keep me up, either. Is this worth looking into?
NotSignal	I don’t know if anybody else gets this but I start doubting if I have it or not, I do this with other things like depression and anxiety do it might just be but I was curious if anyone else goes through this.
Signal	i got both and it’s a living nightmare close my eyes and intrusive thoughts and then my adhd gets me hyper i feel crazy and most nights I’m awake all night
Signal	Doesn't matter what i do or try, sooner or later I will always end up in this situation.Rn I'm just anxious and tired af. Been in bed for an hour or so because my parents don't let me stay up late. And knowing I'm the only one awake and should be sleeping is making me hella stressed especially cause I have a lot of exams coming up.I already get really anxious about sleep in weeks where I don't have anything to do but the exams are obviously making it a lot worse. I hate this shit
NotSignal	So I think this post is pretty self-explanatory but I'm curious to know if people have seen much improvement with their sleep after installing F.Lux?
NotSignal	My toe wiggling is not as noticeable during the day; more so when I’m in bed. I wiggle my right big toe first, then my left one right after. I do them in sets of 5 wiggles. Three on the right and 2 on the left. I do them in quick succession of one another. With quick pauses after each 5. I seem to do it mindlessly but it ends up keeping me awake since I do them so fast. When I stop, I just go back to doing it as soon as I forget. I’ve been able to manage in the past, though it is harder now. I’m gonna try to get my little piggies under control now so I can sleep. Goodnight, hope everyone can get some rest soon. :)
Signal	The last 2 months have consisted of severe insomnia, night sweats, early morning awakenings, lots of anxiety in general. The supplements I’m currently taking are: magnesium, l-theanine, kava, vitamin d 2000 iu, fish oil, ashwaganda ksm-66. On top of taking these I eat very clean, get cardio, am not overweight, not diabetic, drink tons of water, and practice so many healthy habits so I don’t know what could be causing such severe insomnia.
NotSignal	Aren’t I a lucky gal. I wonder if anyone else feels their insomnia is secondary to anything else (or tertiary in my case)
NotSignal	I’m wondering if anyone knows of any function or app that could block the clock on my iPhone during set times? I’m at a point where I fall asleep okay (Indica THC oil is what did the trick for me), but I’m still struggling with staying asleep. Some of it is tied to my menstrual cycle so I don’t know if I can “fix” it entirely, but I’d like to be able to watch Netflix on my phone to try getting back to sleep, but without seeing the time. Not looking for judgement re: said Netflix, just want to know if I can make my phone do the thing. Thanks in advance for any suggestions anyone may have.
Signal	I'm sure this is a common thread, but I just need to say it. My anxiety, my depression, my diet/health. It's all catching up to me and now I can't fall asleep until the early morning. It's almost 4 am where I am, and I'm gettin up for work in about 2.5 hours. I'm tired, mentally and physically, of this shit. I don't know what to do, but one thing is for sure: I can feel myself losing my grip on my own sanity and the real world.I keep hearing music playing on a loop forever. I also keep seeing horrifying creatures and disturbing scenes play out in my head on loop whenever I close my eyes and try to sleep. I'm really close to just ending it all.
NotSignal	I have always been terrified of sleeping because it makes you vulnerable despite being a super light sleeper. I am currently on who knows how many days without sleep and have realized I’m probably terrified of sleep due to some fun trauma issues. I don’t know if anyone else feels like this it’s just awful to deal with and I’m so sick of this.
Signal	Has anyone been able to find a sleeping pill that doesn't cause dry mouth? I've been on Seroquel for years, but I stopped sometime last year because it was damaging my gums due to the side effect of dry mouth. I'm not technically supposed to stop meds, but I'd rather not take something that contributes to gum disease. Maybe there's a way I can offset the dry mouth? I did try drinking more water, but it didn't help. Anyways, open to any suggestions. Thanks
Signal	I have been experiencing nocturnal panic attacks for the last 4 months or so. It always begins the same. I wake up, usually 1-3 hours I had fallen asleep. I feel myself perk my head up from a rush of anxiety, where all I am thinking about is “oh my god one day i’m gonna die and cease to exist and not feel anything anymore or be here anymore”. And then I feel like I cannot feel my limbs/move them. I panic and start moving my arms and legs, which sometimes have pins and needles on them, sometimes not. But most of the time they do, which makes me wonder if I am sleeping on them and that is waking me up in the first place. I don’t know.I only notice this doesn’t happen when I take 10mg of melatonin. Thats the only thing that keeps me out. I rarely use it though because I am terrified that one day i’ll get used to taking it and that won’t help anymore. I feel like these panic attacks are being triggered by something but i’m not sure. I got blood work taken a few weeks ago which I was high/low in 4 things:High: albumin, 5.1. (Range is 3.2-4.8)High: LDL cholesterol, 112. (Range is <100)High: IGF-1, 267. (Range is 188-257)Low: TSH, 0.422. (Range is 0.550-4.780).I am not sure if anything underlying is causing this but I have gone my entire life without experiencing panic attacks let alone nocturnal ones. Now all of a sudden this year I feel absolutely out of control of my life. Once I get insurance figured out I’m definitely going to have a doctor look at my bloodwork/see a psychiatrist. I feel so hopeless.
Signal	I took my morning meds at 3pm cause I woke up late and the afternoon meds I probably took a couple hours later. I took birth control and ducalox (for constipation.) and I have a third dose I have to take as well as a sleeping pill. I’m so paranoid I’m going to die in my sleep. I haven’t get diagnosed with somniphobia.but I definitely have symptoms of it. Every thing is prescribed other then the otc ducalox . I also have trouble taking my trazdone cause of the same fear
NotSignal	Hi all. I posted about 4 weeks ago ready to abandon the CBT-I program I was on because I was suffering badly and couldn’t see any relief in sight. I wanted to let you know that things have gotten much better now even though I almost abandoned the program entirely a few times. I’m still sticking to it and this past week was the first in many weeks where I’ve slept well for the whole week. I have to tell you that I added in a vape pen specifically designed for sleep and as soon as I did I noticed an immediate improvement. So now I’m making progress with the CBT-I and am also using the vape pen (dosist, if you wanted to know the brand). I’m really pleased and wanted to share, in case any of you wanted to go that route as well.
Signal	I stopped taking my Iodine supplement, its the detoxadine brand before they reduced how much was in there brand @ 3 drops = 1300% DV so I take 1-2 drops max.I woke up today feeling like I slept, I never had lots of vivid dreams, I feel like I can do stuff again.Never realised the Iodine played such an important roll in my sleep stack, might be something too think about with anyone who can't get restful sleep.Hope you all are well and got some good sleep, my skin has been a mess since going down too England and messing with my sleep schedule (Maybe the water?)
Signal	Hi all, I'm completely new to this subreddit because I've been having bad insomnia problems. I'm from the UK and we got put on lockdown about a month back and before then, I'd usually fall asleep at 3am and when I was out, I was completely out cold. Then the lockdown started and my sleep schedule got progressively worse, I started falling asleep at 4am, then 5am. Then over the past couple nights I haven't been able to fall asleep at all, and when I finally do fall asleep, it's only for 2 or 3 hours, and it's incredibly light and I keep waking up. This has really freaked me out as I've never had any problems with sleeping now all of a sudden, I'm so ridiculously exhausted, yet I lay in bed with my eyes closed for 5 fucking hours unable to fall asleep. I already have anxiety disorder and depression, and this added on is just ruining me. I've heard that melatonin is good but I've also heard from many people it causes nightmares and night terrors, and when I was younger I would regularly deal with night terrors and I do not want to go through that again. I'm just at a loss on what to do.
Signal	Hey guys,I havent slept more than 8 hours in a week... I feel like my body is shutting down. I have major anxiety over my symptoms, weak shaky legs/knees, right calf muscle has been tight/cramped for about 3 days non stop, hands are starting to feel weak and shaky, hard to type.I have been prescribed zopiclone. Been taking 5mg for the last 2 nights. Can only manage to sleep for 2 hour off of them.Anyone else have something like this happen to them? I am really scared and just exhausted, but my body wont sleep.
Signal	Hello everyone,I am a veteran of the insomnia world. I have had insomnia for about 20 years now. I have taken every medication available at some point that I am aware of. They would stop working after awhile and I would switch medications. Most recently Belsomra ( which I highly recommend, more of a natural sleep, and not a drug induced type sleep ).. which lasted several years before it stopped working 2 weeks ago. In the past 2 weeks I have tried many alternative ways to help sleep. I have purchased a star trek thing that forced my brain into gamma.. which did not work at all. I have purchased farraday cloth and litterally wrapped it around my head to see if the wifi signals/cell phone signals could have been a cause of my insomnia.. (surprisingly this helped some.. but not all).. I have taken vitamins to help sleep. I have everything I can think of and nothing is working. If anybody has any tips or advice.. I don't care how far fetched they are I would appreciate it. Thanks.
Signal	I'll make it short.I had once a sleepless night (without my will) and since then i'm afraid that i will not sleep everyday.During the last month i improved a lot and developed/improved my coping mechanisms and slept more or less very well.Days passes and i feel better and better.But right now, the anxiety starts to twist reality again.I don't know what to do or how to feel.I'm afraid that i'll lose all the things that i've achieved.I'm just afraid.Even now, the anxiety tries to implement that the action of writing this down is a sign of things getting worse.
NotSignal	I have my first exam of the school semester tomorrow and I am wide awake. So much preparation, to be stumped by little sleep the night before. Hopefully I can do well regardless! I hope you all get a good nights sleep
NotSignal	I almost prefer staying awake the entire night than the frustration of going to bed early (11-12pm) then waking up at 1am then 3am then if I can go back to sleep then 5am. It is so frustrating knowing your body got to sleep but then woke up for no reason what so ever. I feel well rested enough now but I know but 11am I'll be absolutely dead and wont be able to function properly.
Signal	i was prescribed trazodone 100mg a couple months back for my sleep and yet no luck, it didn’t affect me at all so i was prescribed hydroxizine 50mg and it worked barely however it had a delayed effect that wouldn’t hit me for hours should i call my doctor again and if so am i just gonna get something that won’t help or is otc
NotSignal	I had no idea I would turn out like this. It just happened to turned into a struggle and it all started from my sleep schedule. I started to gain a habit of being on my phone late at night. It went on for days to weeks,to 10:00 to 1: 00am.I had tried to stop but it was to late. The damage had been done I completely ruined sleeping for me. I tried for a for months but I keep on going back for my phone from boredom at night. I don't know what to do anymore, my body won't let me sleep until that certain time. I just found this sub reddit and I already found people who have struggled too in different ways and seeing their stories.If you're reading this, I thank you. -ihateapples
NotSignal	Hello, this not happens all nights, but there are nights that for example I fall asleep at 11:30pm, I wake up at 6am, and I fall asleep again and when I wake up it's 7:00m, it's less than 1h 30m (a complete cycle), it's normal this?Also, in a rare ocassion for example I fall asleep at 11:30pm, and wake up at 12:00, like a nap, and then fall asleep again and wake up hours later.
NotSignal	Anybody wish they could turn back in time just 1 day before your imsomnia first started? Like just 1 day to do something or stop it from happening. All of this shit would never happens if I didn't play video games for 7 hours straight.
NotSignal	So I decided to search “ WW2 bodies” at night because I was interested and now I can’t sleep. It’s been 5 hours and I am still can’t fall asleep. What is actually happening? I’ve tried everything like switch sides of bed. Also to add insult to injury I have health anxiety.
NotSignal	This will sound so weird but I kinda like insomnia cause it makes me feel safer at night knowing nothing is wrong. I’ave had insomnia for the last month or two and feel so much more save with my anxiety at night
NotSignal	I didnt get any sleep past 48 hour. Whenever i lay my head down i tend to overthink and ruminate about situations in the past and just random other thoughts, also i noticed song stuck in my head.Havent been sleeping well for 2 years now since a negative event happened. (No trauma)Is the insomnia triggered by GAD or is it more like OCD?
Signal	Hey everyone. I just got prescribed this to help me with sleep. More specifically, to help me break the whole anticipatory anxiety thing with bedtime. So, what are your guy’s experiences with this drug? Does it help much? Any side effects?
Signal	hullo, i don't know how insomnia works, are there different ways people go through it? do any of y'all have insight on the general basis of how it works? sorry, i have a lot of questions lol but my friend has insomnia where they'll stay up for days and then fall asleep for a day, is that considered insomnia? i think it is but i'm not sure and don't know too many people in real life to ask or get help from :/ are there any ways i can help my friend (who is hecka stubbourn) to increase their sleep time?
Signal	Hey everyone, this is my first post here on this community. Well, going to the post itself, it's been more or less almost 2 months that I have been having too much anxiety and at night plain panic attack, depending on the day, ranging from one to three panic attacks at night. I will be starting by tomorrow using "Escitalopram" to control my anxiety day to day and when needed during the crisis of panic attack using "Frontal". But I know that it may take weeks to start truly doing effects on me and helping, and just thinking by having more weeks going to sleep at 5am or 6am it's just terrible. The thing is, it seems that I only have strong panic attacks at night and it would really help getting back on track sleeping at 10pm or 11pm so I wouldn't even experience those panic attacks at night.I still have some episodes that get close to panic attack from day, but they are more rare and more easy to control, being by the fact that there are people around the house by day. If I stay alone at night not having anyone around me when I have the panic attack is more hard to control alone.I would really appreciate some feedback from you guys, who have experienced or have been experiencing this, and how you are going through it or how did went through it.I'm thinking in tomorrow not sleeping and staying 24 hours to try to reset my circadian cycle. This could be a good idea?
NotSignal	I've been lying in the same position on my bed, eyes closed, mind racing for most the night. Finally gave in and decided to take my medication. I learnt a new skill however, i can recite the months of the year backwards now ... Anyone else have simular problems?
NotSignal	Doctors of reddit, i struggle to sleep during the night. I have been struggling massively my whole life, taking from 30 mins, to as high as 3 hours to get to sleep. Do you guys think that i have insomnia? :/ if not, do u think i have a different sleeping disorder? I really want to know.
Signal	I’ve had a good sleep routine for awhile but if I ever don’t go to sleep on time I end up not sleeping (I have a sort of sleeping pill obviously not an actual one but it helps me sleep) but recently if I don’t get to sleep and stay awake most of the night, I get so stressed I get mad and upset. I even end up digging my nails into my thighs out of frustration (boy are my nails really long) I never used to do this I was just a little annoyed but shrugged it off, it just seems to be getting worse the later I stay up the more irritable I get. Please does anyone know what to do
NotSignal	recently i’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping. my little brother used to take melatonin and it used to help me drift off quickly i’m thinking about buying some to improve my sleep. i’ve been depending on alcohol and it never works. i’ve recently turned 17, how old do i have to be to buy melatonin over the counter in the uk. i’ve looked online and can’t find any info, thanks.
Signal	I have been taking Klonopin every day for the past 12 years (at least) in varying doses. In October of 2018, I wanted to come off so my doctor began to slowly taper me off (about 1/4 off a pill every month) my then 2 mg dosage. In December of that year, I decided to just stop tapering and stopped taking Klonopin. I know, bad idea. About 2 weeks after taking my last pill, I stopped sleeping. On "good" nights I sleep maybe 5 hours. Most nights I don't sleep at all, or no more than 3 hours. I basically haven't been able to sleep since 2018. I sometimes can get by with my baseline medications in addition to sleeping pills. Every night I take 2400mg Neurontin, 300 Lithium, .2 mg Clonodine. This isn't including the sleeping pills I have been prescribed including Lunesta, Trazodone, Ambien, Sonata, Seroquel. I can't remember all the ones I have tried, but these are some. I have also tried herbal stuff and meditation, acupuncture, CBT-I, Benadryl, healthy sleep stuff. Truly nothing has worked for me. Has anyone done anything that really helped that I haven't mentioned? Or does anyone have experience with Benzo withdraws lasting a year or more? I have seen multiple doctors, but they all basically tell me to drink herbal tea. I haven't felt like myself in almost two years. It is exhausting trying to do anything. I really hate this part of me.
NotSignal	I want to stop eating at night but I get so bored that I just start eating. Someone else doing the same thing ? If someone have any suggestions feel free to comment.
NotSignal	I gotta get up at 6:00 to prepare for a competition. Instead I’ve been lying in the dark for the past couple of hours thinking. Why is sleep a necessity?
Signal	I’ve been taking em for like 2 months (15mg) and previously been on them for 5+ month and they always knock me out and gave me a good sleep. Currently 5am and not even tired. Is there anything else good for insomnia? Other then trazadone, didnt like that one.Thanks.
NotSignal	WHY IS MY ROOMMate so fucking loud? He's a smoker and has COPD and constantly clears his throat of mucous into a water bottle that he tends to leave kahign around everywhere. He is so fucking loud I want to fucking die
Signal	I cannot put off this essay any longer. I really do need to finish it, but that wasn't important enough to stave off a bout of insomnia. I got at least a little sleep, I almost always do, but the acute nature of my problem means it strikes almost at random. I couldn't sleep until sometime near 4 a.m., and couldn't sleep any later than 9 a.m. I'm running on about 5 hours of sleep and I simply cannot deal. It's so hard and frustrating to try and focus on something with such a cognitive impairment. I don't have time for this crap. Fuck my stupid lizard brain.
NotSignal	İnitially, i spent my quarantine days alone, didn't eat well, didn't see daylight and didn't leave home because in my country it was illegal so in that situation i was Ok. But about a mounth ago i watched a horror film and it caused panic disorder and insomnia so i went to a psychiatrist and he told me that i will be ok(it was about two weeks ago) than he gave me stilizan(drug) and it helped me a lot. It finished my panics but i cant sleep very well. Before the stilizan i was sleeping about 3-6 hours and now im sleeping about 5-7 hours but not a kind of perfect sleep also i sleep in my moms room cuz it helps me to fall asleep. But im kinda worried, so what do you think?
NotSignal	What are my options at this point?? Birds starts to chirp & sun comes in about an hour😭 i hate myself
NotSignal	Does anyone else not have trouble falling asleep taking a nap, but will take hours to fall asleep when it’s time for bed? Can anyone explain why this happens? Trouble falling asleep at night happens regardless if I took a nap during the day or not.
NotSignal	I've always had trouble sleeping but the last few nights I've been just nodding off and then I jerk awake and don't actually sleep until very early in the morning. Has anyone ever experienced this before? if so do you have any advice on how to stop it?
NotSignal	Has anyone tried warm milk + nutmeg before bed. Did it help?Do you guys have any tips/suggestions for insomnia.
Signal	I slept fairly well I think yesterday, still no dreams but I went to bed before 12 closed my eyes and opened them and it was like 6:48 then dozed off again and it was 8. I have had horrible sleep for a long time now since probably april is it normal to feel absolutely exhausted and tired and like you could fall asleep again and yawning after a decent sleep like that. Is it just your body catching up on said sleep?
Signal	Last night I couldn’t sleep until 6 am and I got three hours. The night before that I hardly slept at all. And I can’t sleep tonight. My mind is constantly racing yet everything feels slow motion. This has been going on for weeks now, and I feel physically sick all the time.In the past I’ve tried Seroquel for insomnia and it was horrible, and strong melatonin doesn’t seem to work either. I’ve tried many other remedies too but no luck. I might call my doctor later. Are their any strong sleeping meds that have worked for you, ones that you take just when you need them?
NotSignal	I have work in 2 hours its 8:10 am this always happens whenever I have work I am not sure why I sometimes just think about all the time and I don't know why
Signal	I'm diagnosed with insomnia. I can't sleep more than 3 hours in row, even if I work the whole day. i also have hard time falling asleep.I've tried taking benzodiazepines, they did help. But i know they are really addicting and its also easy to develop tolerance. I use phenergan now, and apparently there's a shortage of it in my area. Does anyone know other alternatives? (I prefer antihistamines/meds which aren't addictive)
Signal	For a year now I haven't been sleeping at all like I used to.I am 22 years old and I have always been of an anxious nature, in the past I had a period where I became agoraphobic and sometimes had panic attacks, it was complicated and I learned to live with it, now I have almost no agoraphobia problems, and I had no problem sleeping until last year.I had to work hard to do my graduation work in a very short period of time. One day I went to bed, I couldn't sleep and I developed a lot of stress since that day mainly. I remember it was a time when there was always a bird next to my window that wouldn't stop singing from 4 am. As I went to bed late every day because I was working, I tried to rush to sleep quickly so that I wouldn't hear it and sometimes I had trouble sleeping, not least because of that.I was stressed at the thought of not being able to sleep and the next night didn't help, I was much too anxious to sleep. I think I had a kind of burnout. I went 3 days without sleep and finally managed to get some sleep the night before my presentation. Since that time I still have this feeling that I wonder if I'm going to be able to sleep well every night. I am afraid to relive what I experienced last year not being able to sleep for 3 days (which happened again shortly after the first time), it was very upsetting. I have never taken a sleeping pill because I consider that my problem is mainly due to anxiety. On the other hand, I often take melatonin and herbal medicines (passion flower, valerian, chamomile...). It helped me in the beginning but I think that now it's mostly psychological. I notice that the moments when I have the most trouble sleeping are when I'm planning something the next day or when I'm not at home. I get stressed out or my heart rate increases on its own which is disturbing and prevents me from being relaxed. It's a kind of vicious circle.Also, I have noticed that I am a little less anxious when I sleep with someone else.I hope one day to get back the ability to sleep that I had before, in my everyday life it prevents me from doing certain things because from the moment I'm not at home (even on holiday) or I plan something important, I know that I'm very likely not to be able to sleep well. Also I wake up much more easily than before (usually 2 times during the night when I sleep). This doesn't stop me from going back to sleep in general, but it's something I had a lot less of in the past.I also avoid anything with tea/coffee after 5pm, I use blue light filters, I take herbal medicines to help me but I think it doesn't help much as it's mainly related to stress.What advice would you give me that would work? I've heard of CBT, but I don't know exactly what it is or if it would work for me.Thank you for reading me.
Signal	Have you ever just casually expressed to a coworker that for the entirety of the week you maybe only slept for about 2-3 maybe even 4 hours a night, IF you even went to bed at all. And every person around you wants to one-up your lack of sleep? "Oh well uhhh I didn't go to bed until 3 this morning and I had to get up at five". Okay that's cool but I'm in a constant state of sleep anxiety and the only way dreams find me are if I'm drunk or doped up. Like??? What are they trying to prove? Being tired isn't a competition and ya it sucks you has one night of poor sleep but that doesn't make you like cool? I'm bringing it up to apologize for my behavior, I'm not entirely here every single day bc I'm battling the moon and hating the sun. What a strange flex?! I know normies naturally want to be apart of everything. "Omg my ocd is so bad! Omg I'm sorry I have adhd lol I'm so random! Omg like I swear to god I'm bipolar!" I just don't understand it I guess and it annoys me. I'm not gatekeeping. But it makes me look like my complaint isn't an actual problem bc that person wants to brag about no sleep and still functioning. Mean while I'm embarrassed and tormented and have lost jobs over this shit wtf
NotSignal	I am so fucking pissed off, let me explain. Yesterday I got 4 hours of sleep and today I tried to fall asleep which I did and then boom my dumbass sister turned on the light, WHAT THE FUCK she knows I have sleep issues so why would u do this. It’s jus not fair my family doesn’t understand what I’m goin thru and the basic thing humans have I have to fucking fight my body for it... and im takin my anger out on a reddit post. This is the type of shit that makes me wanna die. I’m lonely and im crying so much im hanging on to a loose thread before I completely lose it at least be a decent fucking human being and don’t turn on the light when some1 sleeping.
Signal	Took melatonin again for the first time in months. Fell asleep at one thirty, but woke up from a nightmare at three in the morning, tossing in bed for about half an hour before falling back asleep. Woke up once more at around noon but unable to move or keep eyes open for another half hour. Is this normal?
Signal	It's significantly more expensive at about $2 per capsule, but the 25mg Charlottes Web CBD oil has been great. I've been taking 0.5mg of Xanax every night for a long time and for the last two weeks I've reduced the dosage to 0.25mg (under my doctor's supervision) and added the CBD oil. I'm waking up feeling less groggy and just feel better in general. I'm planning on completely tapering off the Xanax over the next few months and am very happy to know there are effective substitutes that don't mess with your nervous system.
NotSignal	For as long as I can remember, I’ve had trouble falling and staying asleep. I have an erratic sleep schedule and will often need 10-12 hours. I kind of accepted this as a fact of life until, ironically, my partner’s snoring helped me discover the best solution to my sleeping problem.I recently bought a pair of cheap headband headphones and used a soundscape and white noise generating app (myNoise). With greater consistency than, well pretty much ever, I fell asleep quickly and it was easy to fall back asleep. I felt well rested after 8 hours of sleep! Unfortunately, the battery life seems to diminish fairly quickly on the one I purchased. Currently, I have looked into better headband headphone brands (specifically SleepPhones), smart sleep pillows, and pillow speakers. I am willing to drop upwards of $100 if the quality of the item quality is consistent and will last a long time (years), however, cheaper is always better.In terms of recommendations, please keep in mind the following:• **No ambient noise machines.** My restless sleeping disrupts him. I don’t want to disrupt him more.• **No earplugs or anything that goes in the ear canal.** I will pull it out in my sleep. Plus, pure noise cancelation is not effective for me.• **Doesn’t have to play music/podcasts.** If it’s durable, comfortable, but can only play preloaded nature/white noise tracks, that’s fine by me. I just want to sleep.• **For wireless options, at least 9 hours of battery life.** Preferably more. I tend to wake up and stay awake if the device stops.TL;DR What are some personal listening options for sleeping to white noise/nature sounds? No in ear devices. Cheaper is better, but I’ll spend upwards of $100 of the product is reliable and durable (and will help me sleep).
NotSignal	this is the only place i think could help, i apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on.i recently started remembering an event that happened 7 months ago, and its causing me not to sleep, i cant even push these memories away, because of how bad i feel, I haven't slept much in the past days, since this is all ive beein thinking off.
NotSignal	I used to nap all the time in college. This semester, I started riding my bike to classes for the first time ever. I also am taking a swimming for fitness class that I have Tuesday’s and Thursday’s.I struggle with taking naps on these daysDoes anyone know why ever since I started exercising it’s harder to sleep at night and have my daily naps lol
NotSignal	So I couldn’t sleep in the last 4 days.Of course I went to bed earlier, closed my eyes but I just stayed awake. Eventually after several hours I could sleep for 3 hours but I start having headaches.Is it normal? Im terified. I want this to stop.
Signal	Please no horror stories... I’m really on edge right now :/It all started when I felt depersonalization. I’ve *been* having the disorder but started to have an unusual episode and freaked out. Then sleeping problems came 4 days later. Couldn’t tell if I slept or not. Can’t fall asleep whatsoever, even when calm. For the past couple days I’ve been experiencing a lot of self-doubt, confusion, extreme obliviousness/trouble concentrating etc.. I can’t find anything online about this. Am I going insane, is it depersonalization, or insomnia?? I’m just afraid and I’m dissociating more than the beginning right now. I’m so doubtful and confused and paranoid that life feels almost totally unfamiliar at this point.Is this normal??
NotSignal	As the title states, fell asleep during a work meeting. Granted it was a training meeting but I was to sign off on a training form and then leave the meeting. I woke up to the presenter calling my name and asking if I was still there. Thank god I have no idea who this person was but still, the embarrassment. I’m so fed up with this insomnia. My problem is falling asleep. It’s been years since I’ve consistently slept well. The last time I slept well for a week straight was last Christmas while I was on vacation - not because I was relaxed but the only way I consistently sleep well is if I’m really tired enough. I can only count a few nights after that where I’ve slept on time. People I met after that vacation said I looked so “fresh.” Yeah I try to exercise so I’m physically tired to sleep but some days it just doesn’t happen - I work and I’m a student and got PCOS and hypothyroidism to add to it. I have possible insulin resistance too so it’s usually the hunger that keeps me up and then I have to binge eat. I’ve figured out intermittent fasting and keeping full during the day helps this but some nights the hunger is still real. And the dark circles are just something else.
Signal	So my sleep became really fragmented recently, now even though I stay in bed for up to 12 hours I wake up a couple dozen times (moreso towards the end) and have massive brain fog most of the day, and still feel sleepy/yawn. What is most likely the problem in your guys experience?
NotSignal	I’ve been dealing with sleep issues for a while and i noticed a pretty big drop in sex drive and i’m only 18.....I’m afraid my gf will dump my ass if this will go on for much longer... I used to be a funny kid but now this quarantine shit made me sleep way less and made me be less interested in the things that matter in life....How do you and your partner cope with your insomnia ? Every day i’m tired of studying for college and all day i’m anxious about how will i manage to sleep.....I slowly see everyone getting tired of my shit...
NotSignal	so i pulled an all nighter yesterday night and slept from about 11am-4pm. woke up to go skating with my friend, and pulled ANOTHER all-nighter dispute having 5 hours of sleep. i just can’t put my phone away because i get too bored being left alone with my thoughts.
Signal	Just a 1.5 months ago, I had the belief that I will never be able to sleep without sleeping pills. I had to count how many pills are left and anxious whether my GP would further prescribe me with pills. I would sleep only for 2-4 hours every a night. If I drink sleeping pills, I can get 6 hours but I am drugged as hell. It's like I am on hallucination all throughout the day.By restricting my time in bed to 5-6.5 hours for a number of weeks, I was able to build my sleep drive.By using the bed only for sleep, I re-developed the association of bed and sleep. It made me fall asleep easier and (the hardest part for me) waking up in the middle of the night and falling back asleep happen. By getting out of bed when I cannot fall asleep or when anxious thoughts race like hell, I was able to gradually taper the sleepy anxiety.By not trying to fall asleep when I hit the pillow, I gradually reduce the fear that I may not be able to fall asleep and before I knew it, I am already sleeping.Sleep is only affected by two factors: (1) how many hours you were awake during the day and (2) how aroused you are near bedtime. I am sure you have moments where you were able to fall asleep with loud noises, bright lights and uncomfortable mattress. Therefore, sleep hygiene rituals can help but it paradoxically makes us think we can fall asleep when we do them. The only ritual I stick to is reading a book with a dim lamp on living room a few minutes (30 min or less) before I sleep.Instead of saying "I need to sleep", say "My body needs sleep", "My mind needs sleep". This is the fact. You cannot make yourself fall asleep. Just like when you are going to be hungry or thirsty, you cannot make it happen. Your body and mind make it happen and a lot of stuff going on in our body and mind, we cannot control.CBT-I seems regimented at first but be aware that as soon as you see progress, you can be less strict about it (i.e. time in bed is extended, not going out of bed when waking up in middle of night, etc.).At present, I still practice CBT-I but I limit this only to sleep restriction (6.5-7 hours) and reading book a few minutes before bedtime. Stimulus control is only when necessary but so far for the past week or two, I did not have to get out of bed. Paradoxical intention also helps from time to time but usually I just imagine things and body/mind falls asleep.
Signal	I am 16 so it already is veryyyy unlikely for me to have it but I have been having trouble sleeping for the past 2 days, maybe getting just 2 hours of sleep, I want to sleep so bad but still can't, my anxiety is off the roof thinking about this disease which slowly kills you in 6 months while you are feeling every bit of it, I know I don't have it but I just can't convince myself, please help
NotSignal	Tired of this shit every night. I thought the meds would help. My head feels like it's on fire.Fuuuuuuck thiiiiiis shiiiiiit.
NotSignal	In the past 40 something days I wasn't able to sleep during the night at all and I will fall asleep after 9 am.Last night I've had sex for the first time in 2 months and I was able to fell asleep at 3:30 - 4:00I woke up from a dream at 7:30 but I was so happy that I fell asleep that now I cant fall asleep again.But it felt so good to sleep again.. I'm gonna put some Ricky Gervais - Karl Pilkington podcasts and hopefully Ricky's laugh will let me sleep.
Signal	Hi all, I’ve had insomnia on and off for a few years, but developed severe insomnia during the pandemic and subsequently returning to work on the semi-front lines. I couldn’t sleep a wink and it was definitely related to anxiety. I started lexapro a week ago, and just that fact alone has calmed me a bit. Every evening I take a nap (I just pass out from the exhaustion and stress of the day), and then am awake 10:30pm-1:30am. During this time I have a few glasses of wine and NyQuil. I know, not the healthiest way to sleep well, but it works! I sleep the whole night thru! I feel rested in the morning! Another trick I do is to have a snack - I’ve found if I’m hungry when I’m trying to fall asleep then I have very shallow sleep and wake up easily. Anyone else have this issue?
NotSignal	I had a tooth pulled 4 hours ago and all I want to do is sleep. My pain tolerance is ridiculous so all together I ended up getting no less then 6-8 shots of Novocain probably more cause at one point the dentist had to shake me cause I fell asleep ( and wtf I barely fall asleep in my own bed ) but I swear the chair was the most magically comfortable chair I’ve ever sat it! Plus every time I sit down I knock out!!! Is it the Novocain?!??? Does it make you sleepy? Does it make you silly? And wtf does “magically comfortable” even reallllly meann?
NotSignal	So my sleeping schedule has been severely messed up for a while now, but right now it’s a problem. I went out drinking with some pals tonight and it... didnt go the best, i threw up like 4 times when i got home. But now my issue is that i read that i absolutely need sleep to get the alcohol out of my system. Which isn’t really happening, i’ve been laying in bed for 4 hours and i’m wide awake. I don’t know what to do honestly, any advice?
Signal	So I've always had trouble sleeping. Either takes me sooo long to get to sleep, and/or I wake up every hour or so through the night. I've had nightmares on occasion but never this bad. For the past several nights I've had nightmares so bad they wake me up in a panic and I think about those dreams all day. I'm reluctant to even try to sleep anymore because I don't want to deal with experiencing nightmares like that. Anyone else dealing with this?
NotSignal	I don’t know I fell asleep since I didn’t remember dreams. I wish I could’ve remembered a single dream to calm down
Signal	i've tried seroquel, trazodone, belsomra, literally all the natural herbal supplements you can think of. those "sleep routines" like guided meditations, herbal tea, shutting off electronics, etc don't help me consistently. i'm getting desperate, my psychiatrist prescribed ambien today but i'm terrified of an addiction. i've been using ghb at night to knock me out as a last resort lately but really don't wanna keep doing that as it's a scheduled drug and i'm not a fan of doing things under the radar like that. i guess i might as well take a *prescribed* drug under the care of a professional, but i'm worried ill get hooked on it. and i've heard ambien shouldn't be taken long term anyways. and i've heard about the horrible side effects.tldr nothing else has worked, should i bother with an ambien rx
NotSignal	I keep seeing this commercial that promises a better nights sleep with a weighed blanket. It's supposed to help sleeping with anxiety and create a safe and comfortable feeling.The blankets I see are quite expensive, but I would absolutely get one if they do as promised.Do you have one and what is your experience with it?
Signal	I take Seroquel 25 mg with other meds and most of the time I get sleep. But recently if I can't sleep before 5-6, I start getting jitters and they are pretty bad. I have to shake a lot aggressively because I start to feel jittery (idk how to describe that feeling). If I sleep in the afternoon because of the after effects of meds, I get so vivid and random dreams that I would first try to wake up because my body seems to be moving but it isn't and when I wake up, my whole body is so tired and I am also breathing very heavily. Anyone know what is this and why is it happening?
Signal	So I haven’t had Benadryl in like two weeks, I realized that every time I took it I got depressed. I started using high doses because it was hard to fall asleep I have UC.Since stopping my mental health is so much better, However now I’m up all night longer than usual my mind is so active.
Signal	The only thing I've found that helps me sleep is Seroquel. But I recently found out that it is pretty bad for you long term. Also, it makes me sleep for 12-18 hours (sometimes longer) and I wake up feeling like I haven't slept. The only reason I can even take it right now is because I'm not working due to COVID. Once I start working again I'll need to be up early and won't be able to stay on it. I decided to try to go without it for a bit and I got a strong reminder of how things used to be. I've been up for 4 days. I'm too tired to do anything, I have no energy. But time is passing so slowly. Everything hurts, all of my muscles are sore. I feel like I'm not real. I can't stop crying. I'm probably going to cave and take the fucking pill. I hate it so much. I hate that I need it. What am I going to do when I have to work again??
NotSignal	Im just curious but how many of us here are insomniacs because they are afraid to fall asleep? Sleeping can be scary I guess, I know it first hand
NotSignal	I am 18m and have never really had huge sleeping issues until quarantine started. When I was still going to school I would be able to fall asleep by 12 on most nights and pretty much sleep all through the night. However, ever since quarantine started I have been going to bed later and later until that time hit around 3. Now I can’t even fall asleep some nights. This is the 3rd night this week that I haven’t been able to sleep and I’m kinda freakin out. The worst feeling in the world is seeing the sun coming up outside your window after laying in bed for hours trying to sleep. Anyways, it’s 7am now and I’m wondering if I should try and get some sleep now or if I should just get up and hope I can tonight. This whole situation has got me pissed about quarantine even though this problem is probably more my fault. Anything helps and thanks for reading!
NotSignal	Anyone else having this issue? It just makes me worried that insomnia is taking a toll on my immune system :/
NotSignal	this stay at home order really put my anxiety at high levels and completely erased the routine I had just recently grew accustomed to,,, now that I have no sense or routine and my anxiety makes it truly impossible for me to force myself into one at home my insomnia keeps getting worse and worse every day. yesterday I rolled around in bed till 6am and woke up just four hours later unable to fall asleep again.. I expected to get tired during the afternoon and nap but nothing and now it’s almost midnight and I’m wide awake.there’s no way I can turn my mind off and the more I try the worse it gets,,, I always find myself wishing I could get rid of my mind and even fantasizing about hitting my head against something cause maybe that’ll knock me outit’s been so hard sometimes I start to fear it’ll never go away and I’ll never sleep well in my life
Signal	I struggle with insomnia, particularly this week. I went to bed at 11:00 and woke up at 2:00 and tossed and turned without falling asleep until I got out of bed at 7:00. Took an appointment with my doctor today to discuss my anxiety and insomnia. Should I mention Ambien? I used to take benzos before for my anxiety.
NotSignal	Relax. Don't worry about sleep at all - it's never too late to fix your sleep and no one expects you to sleep well at this time. Most of my friends who used to sleep amazingly are either getting 6 hours a night or have adopted wacky sleep schedules from 4am - 11am or something. You know what? Go on your phone. Sleep hygiene is useful, but it's worse to obsess and arrange your night around it. Stop counting how much you sleep. Don't look at how much you should be getting - no one is really getting that right now. Do something until you feel like you're dropping asleep. Then, go to sleep. Can't sleep? Then remember this post. It really doesn't matter right now. Personally, (and this is deep), I'd rather live 70 positive and happy years than 100 years of obsession over sleep. Honestly, just chill, you got this.
Signal	Hey guys, all my life I've been a hard sleeper, slept like 12 hours a night, but suddenly like a month ago my sleep pattern fucked up so bad that now I sleep a maximum of 5h a night, and sometimes I don't sleep at all. For example this week I've only slept 4 days the whole week. I don't know how this happened and why it happened, been to the doctor they did all the checks and all they prescribed was fcking melatonin that doesn't do shit. The thing is some insomniacs sleep few hours a night then an hour or two during the day, I don't sleep during the day at all, never ever.My freaking body hurts alot, I breathe hard. I don't know what and how this occurred its not stress related or anything like that, it's extremely strange to go from sleeping a 12h a night to just laying in bed the whole night. Any suggestions?
Signal	2 am again and just now slinking into bed for another restless night(it’s been the same for 15+ years now, why would it change tonight?) and wondering if I’m the insane one or if I(we?) just don’t exactly fit the mold we are being sold everyday. Society and the 40 hour work week dictate that I must be awake by 6/7/8/9/10(pick your poison) am. My clients/work dictate that I need to be at work in the morning and In the event that we insomniacs are late to whatever our morning obligations are, we are shunned for it. I’m fucking tired of it. I’m 30 and have had insomnia for over half of my life, for so long now that I can’t even remember when It started. What the fuck is the point of all this if I’m just going to continue to have insomnia for the rest of my life? Who the hell am i pleasing with that? What if my circadian rhythm is one that just wants to work later than most everyone else’s? Why should I have to continue suffering my whole life for that? You know when I was in asia a few years ago I slept pretty darn good with the 12 hour time difference. Where I’m at home my body doesn’t want to fall asleep until 6/7/8/9/10am. Change that to PM and suddenly things ain’t too bad. Unfortunately I don’t live in that time zone so it doesn’t do me much good to romanticize it as an answer to my problems. Who knows maybe in 10 years I’ll move somewhere with a more agreeable time zone. I’m really lucky I get to come into work late everyday because I’m good at what I do and vital to the operation but that doesn’t stop the anxiety at night. Doesn’t make the feeling any better that I know everyone shuns me behind my back for it. Doesnt help when I’m still laying awake at 6 am and I start hearing my neighbors dogs barking and I just want nothing more than to bang on my apartment wall yelling at them to shut up so I can try to get a crumb of sleep finally so I won’t spend another day as a walking zombie in anything I do. The worst part about it at least where I live anyways, is there’s nothing to even do at night. Everything shuts down by 9 unless it’s a bar. It’s like a ghost town in a lot of places at these hours even if you were to be able to stay up and start later. I don’t know. I’m just rambling. I’m just mad that I’ve had insomnia for over 15 years and the only reason I can really think why is because someone decided that everyone in America has to be at work at 8 am or you’re a good for nothing lazybones. It grinds my gears.
Signal	My son occasionally takes this for insomnia. He seems to have a Jekyll/Hyde transformation. At first I thought it was something in and if itself. Now I am wondering if it would be the Mitrazapine? Anyone take it for sleep and get weird even aggressive side effects?
Signal	It feels like everytime I lay down my brain says "Oh so now it's time chat about random bullshit until the sun comes up?" It feels like my brain is pressure cooker and every time I lay down and am not doing anything it decides it's time to vent. But a chattering mind is not very conducive to sleep. I even had a good bit of excercise yesterday afternoon. Felt pretty tired around 11, went to first attempt at sleep about 12:30. Lie awake for two hours. Get back up and pass a couple more hours, and then finally fall asleep at 6am only to abruptly find myself wide awake at just before noon and feeling terrible. I just don't get it.
NotSignal	I was going on a pretty good streak getting almost 6 hours of sleep for 3 days and it feels like it’s always like that, after 3 days of decent sleep I get one (probably) sleepless night and the following nights are not good either. Ugh that just destroys my sleep confidence everytime. Im so sick of it. Don’t understand why cause Im not anxious right now I know I could binge watch a show or read a book, but it’s almost 1am and I just want to sleep😫
NotSignal	Seriously pretty devastated. How the hell am I gonna get through work.
Signal	Mostly just venting, but I hate being like this. I lie in bed for hours and hours, often all night long, and nothing. When I do fall asleep I wake up after 4 hours if I'm lucky and can never fall asleep again no matter what. Living is agonyyy
Signal	For the past week or two I've been trying to sleep but wake up at 1 am close my eyes for a bit then it's already 3 am.Does this have to do with insomnia and if so can someone explain it to me?I'm getting scared that this will worsen in the coming weeks if I don't take care of it right away.
Signal	Liiiiiiiiiiiike why? The entire day will be spent without any feelings of anxiety, no heart palpitations, no nothing. But EXACTLY at night, just like clockwork, my anxiety will be like, "bitch u thought" I mEAN wHY? Of course, I am not on any meds either, so I have nothing at all to help me with this stupid insomnia at all. (I think a beta blocker would help, greatly). I am so tired of seeing everyone sleep, and just pathetically stare into the gloomy ceiling the entire night. Ugh. All these heart palpitations make me feel so goddamn lightheaded.
Signal	19-year-old male who has struggled with insomnia his whole life (trouble falling asleep but none staying asleep), and after being medicated with Adderall for ADHD I've had even more trouble falling asleep. In response, my psychiatrist prescribed me Trazodone for sleep and it's worked better than any sleep med or trick I've tried before but the day after it gives me brain fog and concentration problems throughout the whole day EVEN when I'm on Adderall. Currently I'm taking 50 mg per night and want to lower the dose but 25 mg unfortunately does nothing for me. Anyone else have experience with this med? Do the side effects subside over time?
Signal	doctor just prescribed me 0.5mg clonazepam to see if it'll help me sleep but I didn't feel shit after so I took another one but it feels as good as useless? should I increase the dosage any further? I'm 5'2 62kgs F. (I also take topamax for migraines but I'm not sure if that's relevant?)
NotSignal	So past few weeks insomnia has gotten really bad for me, and it wasn't the first time I experienced that, for the past year my sleep schedule has been really messed up and I had no self discipline to fix it. It's not a stretch to say that I almost always slept at day time and only woke up when it's dark out again. Then it would frequently lead to insomnia, it's not unusual that I was up all night and not able to fall asleep at all. As I result my sleep schedule was all over the place, for example if I couldn't sleep from 4am to 12pm, I'd eventually fall asleep in the afternoon and wake up in the eventing, it's like a vicious cycle. It's been too much of a torture so the past week I decided to try out something new, I made it a rule that no matter i was able to sleep or not the whole night I get up roughly at the same time every day, so around late morning or early afternoon, and go to bed at a relatively fixed hour as well. First few days I still wasn't able to sleep much or woke up after 2 hours of light sleeping then took another 4 hours until I fell asleep again. The next few nights I tried not to immediately reach out to my phone when I woke up, and before long I was able to sleep full nights again, it felt amazing. So for those of you whose insomnia is mostly psychological, don't lose hope yet, there will be something that works for you and it's not as hopeless as it seems to sleep like normal again!
NotSignal	Hey guys. Just a general question for people who suffer from Insomnia that I’m curious about. How many hours on average do you sleep per night? Thanks.
NotSignal	Ever since I was a kid I had trouble waking up. Not that I wasn’t getting enough sleep but the fact that it was impossible for me to hear my alarm. I would try different alarms, sounds. I even bought an alarm that shakes the whole bed but even that doesn’t work anymore. When I try waking It feels like I’m in such a deep sleep but also not at all. Even when I go to bed on time I can’t ever hear my alarm. I’ve also found that I subconsciously snooze all my alarms sometimes and won’t realize what I’m doing in the moment. Anybody know how to fix this?
NotSignal	working out doesn't help wake me up when im in slug mode, so im wondering what else would help
Signal	Heyo! I'm 18 y/o and I'm tired sleeping late.I used to sleep at 8am everytime in the morning and wake up like 9pm in the night, yeah afterwards I can't sleep at night at all. Luckily I reduced the habit. I now sleep at 1:00 and I don't know why but I always wakes up at 5:00, it's always 5:00. Is there any reason?Im having interest with this melationin, does it work at all? how many mg should I start? in what time should I take it?and does it really help with insomia and other sleeping disorders?
Signal	I've been having trouble sleeping over the past year and its really stressing me out. For me its especially worse because I have anxiety and not being able to sleep right just makes it worse. I've heard allot of people say that CBD helps to go to sleep and it also helps with anxiety and that is exactly what I have. So my question is, does CBD really help you sleep and does it help with anxiety? I've been wanting to try it but I don't know how I would feel or If it really works.
Signal	I get into a cycle we’re I sleep late and wake up late. And it keeps pushing forward until I am awake until 6am and sleeping until 4-5pm! I bet I have non 24 circadian cycle. Makes having a shift job difficult. I try to use melatonin to keep my cycle a bit better and have benzodiazepines from my psychiatrist when I can’t sleep and need to be up early.Wondering if staying up all night and day to reset my clock would work. Anyone do it? Use my day off to stay up for over 24 to 30 hours so I am exhausted by 10 pm and sleeping and helpfully waking up by 8am or something to get my cycle better. I always revert back to my late schedule though, so it’s as if I need to do it often. I can’t quit my job or change rn as one can imagine. 25 million jobs lost! So I have to find a way to keep mine, which is 1015 to 715 4 days a week. Waking up by 9 am is a challenge! You
NotSignal	When you close your eyes for a bit do you see like shapes and flashes of light and weird images and a heavy feeling? This happens sometimes whenever during the day and it's bizarre.
Signal	So I used to be the best sleeper (Take naps anytime, fall asleep anytime,sleep many hours etc) until a month ago when I suddenly struggled to not only fall asleep or stay asleep. After not sleeping AT ALL for several days, I was perscribed ambien which made me feel like a zombie the next day, then hydroxozyde, which worked one day (felt disassociated and like a zombie next day and couldn't get out of bed) then took it another day (didn't work) and then gave up and decided to get a sleep study. Today, my results came in: insomnia (expected this), I slept for a total of 3 hours on and off, experienced no REM or deep sleep & on top of that stay in Stage 2 of sleep & have an upper airway resistance syndrome. The sleep doctor prescribed me a small dose of trazodone & a referral to an orthodontist to get some kind of mouth guard. Does anyone have a similar experience and a solution? How did trazodone work for you & is it worth it? Is it possible to somehow get back my REM/deep sleep back without this medication? Will this ever get better? I'm so physically drained from sleeping like 2-3 hours a night and just don't know what to do anymore. Thanks guys!
NotSignal	Had to go to a job interview today with no sleep. Not sure if its my terrible anxiety or insomnia or both. Im now back home still trying to sleep but its just not happening. I am surprisingly (for the first time) okay with staying up? its exhausting yes, but i feel like i dont need rest.
NotSignal	I'm having a weird insomnia, which I have treated for 9 months succesfully with tylenol 500mg (4h sleep without, 8h with). I recently was ill and found that it dramatically reduced my quality and quantity of sleep (1h sleep, 3h awake, 2h sleep, 2h awake...). I felt like waking up super alerted after a little sleep and unable to calm down for a few hours.I think normally I used to sleep more when ill. It is like my cox-2 function is reversed. Anyone else with sleeping problems while sick?
NotSignal	Sometimes when I'm trying to sleep, I will feel myself dozing off I suddenly realize that I am about to fall asleep, or that I am sleeping, and immediately get pulled back out. When I get this, I can literally feel my mind being pulled out of the clutches of Morpheous, back to the "just closed my eyes" zone. Right before this happens I usually start dreaming or seeing some sort of dream like state. I have no problem relaxing, and can get to this state in about 15 minutes but when I get pulled back out, it takes me longer and longer to reach it. This has led me to lying in bed for +4 hours at a time, going in and out, then getting up completely unrefreshed!
NotSignal	I've spent all week getting really great sleep and tonight nothing at all. And tonight is the one night I really needed it. I wish there was something I could do to rid myself of insomnia permanently.
NotSignal	I have OCD and PTSD and it couples quite well with insomnia. I thought having a few drinks would help relax me enough ti sleep, but i keep ruminating on past arguments and actions. How bad would it be to pull an all nighter? It sounds easier than falling asleep tbh. Im unaware how the anesthesia might react with the alcohol, but im 6’4” and weigh 265 pounds. Just looking for advice/a new friend who i can talk to when i cant sleep.
NotSignal	How does one fall asleep when their so nervous it keeps them wide awake?
NotSignal	Hey all, sorry if this post is a little too much.Basically, ever since I was 14 I have been masterbating before sleep and now I realized I can only sleep if I do so (at 19). I don’t watch porn or anything and use my imagination. Does anyone have any similar experiences and any advice to overcome this?
NotSignal	At the begining of the week, I started to fall asleep later and later, at first, I was falling asleep at around 4:00 am, then 2 days later it became 5am, then 6, 6:30am. Now its 7am and i didnt slept at all. I don’t even feel tired. Insomnia has been going on since January but never that bad. I’m scared for the following nights.
NotSignal	It's 1pm now. I woke up yesterday at 11, with maybe 3 hours of sleep. The day before that was similar, with barely a few hours and interrupted. My eyes hurt. They feel numb and hurt but I cant sleep. I haven't had to deal with this before. I'm on whitdrawl from antidepressants and my body is going from stage to stage of finding some new extreme to punish me with. Just a stupid rant amongst many but I feel so hopeless. God's speed to good or end because this is purgatory. I can't even imagine what someone whitdrawling from harder meds must go through. My bf offered some knock out meds stuff but have I gone that far?? Eventually I'm bound to pass out, right? Right? It doesn't feel human anymore and all I want to do is cry. Looking for comfort which... If mercy provides, I'll read in a few hours and think 'it's not too bad after all'. Bless you all who have to go through this constantly.
NotSignal	As a musician, this is negatively impacting my performance career and I would greatly appreciate any advice about how to seek treatment. I’m 21F if it matters.
Signal	I’ve never been officially diagnosed with insomnia, and I’m not going to claim I actually do have it, but I’m starting to get a little concerned. I’ll do my best to sum up my concerns quickly. Over the past two years, I’ve noticed I go through very distinct phases of sleep. They happen randomly in batches. The most infuriating one is when I’m absolutely exhausted mentally and physically, and all I want to do is sleep. I end up passing out by 9:00/9:30 and I wake up at nearly 1:00 on the dot every single time and can’t fall back asleep no matter what I try. I’m still crazy tired, and I feel it *hard*, but my body won’t let me rest. The other really obnoxious one is where I’ll fall asleep around 10:00ish and I’ll wake up around1:00, (sometimes as late as 2:00), and don’t go back to sleep again until 4:30/5:00 and I’ll sleep until 7:00 but no later than 7:30 if I don’t need to get up earlier. I won’t get into the others, but I average 5 hours of sleep, and I’m insanely lucky if I get 7 hours. I will, however, have these really random (but infrequent) nights where I’ll end up sleeping for 12-14 hours 😳What’s starting to concern me is that lately I’ve been having more and more nights where I am literally up awake all night and I’m not even tired the following day. I’ll be up for nearly 40 hours and I won’t even really be all that tired when I get into bed after these 0 hour nights. I just had one Wednesday, and I’m having another one tonight. The second most recent was only just now two weeks ago. They’re usually way more spaced out than this, and I don’t know if this is something I should go see doctor about or not. Any advice/thoughts?
Signal	Hi Guys,I have always been having occasional insomnia and rarely have i been able to sleep within 45 mins. But for the past month and a half, I have been experiencing my worst bout of insomnia and anxiety. Reading all your posts here really helps to know I am not alone in my struggle. It all start with 2 sleepless nights and that was when I read about SFI which pulled me into this deep hole of major anxiety and insomnia. My anxiety is so bad now that I would lock myself in the toilet at work to calm myself down. I can't concentrate on my work as well. My doctor gave me Ambien which I took for 2 weeks and that really made me feel better, being able to sleep again. But then he took it away from me, as I should not be taking it long term. This is my third night without it and Im waking up every hr! Still better than the 1st 2 nights where I couldnt even fall asleep. Is this the withdrawal symptoms? Also, the doctor gave me Hydrocyzine in place of the ambien which did nothing but made me more nervous and confused! Im so anxious now that I will never be able to return to normal uninterrupted sleep again!
Signal	Hi there, I was talking to my PCP yesterday about my insomnia caused by anxiety, with the hopes of getting some sort of sleep med, but she said she didn't want to prescribe me anything as she isn't well versed in sleeping meds, and instead recommended some psychiatrists to get in contact with, with the ultimate idea of either going on a long-term anxiety med like prozac or doing CBT. And I get it, there aren't any magic pills, the only sort of cure is addressing the root issue with therapy, but, at the same time, I just need some sleep. So, I'm wondering if anyone here knows how to get a script for some sort of sleep med. I do actually know one that I want to try out, trazodone, as it exists in a nice intersection of effectiveness and safety. Worst side effects are usually a hangover, headaches, or nausea, can be addictive depending on the dose, but generally the withdrawal isn't as bad as other sleeping meds, etc. I'm super afraid of drugs so this helps. I'm definitely wary of benzos and SSRIs. I'm open to Ambien, but also very cautious/skeptical, and I've heard bad things. I've tried benadryl, unisom, and of course melatonin, but none are enough to outpace the anxiety(I've slept, but after a lot of tossing and turning and panicking, about 4-5 hrs of sleeplessness on 50mg benadryl, 2-3.5 on 62.5mg unisom), I'm looking for something that can just knock me out. I ask this questions, because it seems browsing on reddit that people are able to shop around, and try different meds as they please, so I'm wondering if there's some way I could do the same, at least just trying this one. Do I just meet with a psychiatrist, tell them about my troubles, and ask for a med? Is there a quicker option? Can I mention a med by name(and expect to get it)? I have considered urgent care, but I doubt they'd give me anything, and if they did I'm sure it would be something like ambien.
NotSignal	Anyone with sleep apnea here? I suspect I have it. I'm also allergic to dust in mold. Do you know any treatments because I can't go to to the doctor now (because obvious reasons).
Signal	50 mg of melatonin taken so far and I have no more sleeping pills left. Anxiety levels high. Cant sleep and probably wont be able to sleep all night. It's almost 130 am with no sleep in sight. Oh did I mention I start a new job tomorrow so that will be amazing on 0 hours of sleep. Cant wait for that experience. I wish I had some sleeping pills. Melatonin never does it for me but I'm trying...
NotSignal	I’m so proud to say that I told my sleep anxiety last night that it can’t hurt me and it totally helped me calm my mind down, but my stomach would still not stop churning or twisting in knots. I’m wondering if it’s related to the lorazepam I took the night before? I’ve had weird side effects before. Any suggestions also for natural remedies for calming the stomach?
NotSignal	I’ve heard of hypnic jerks, but I have just now in the last couple of weeks been suffering from “mental hypnic jerks”. But I can’t find any info on them. My body doesn’t move, but as I fall into a deep sleep, my brain/mind jolts me back fully awake. This happens for two or three hours, then I am able to sleep soundly the rest of the night. Anyone experience this or know what this possibly could be?
Signal	Hey guys just started SRT. Sleeping 1030Pm-430am. I read a few books and the one allows a 45 min nap. Say goodnight to insomnia. Saying you won’t go into deep sleep in 45 min so no harm. But a lot of other places strictly forbid them. I’m not sure if the others forbid them because they have the potential to go longer than 45 min and backfire? Or because that 45 min really will reduce sleep drive and hurt your progress overlap. I find a nap helpful because 1) this is ALL a mental game. In the middle of the night naps help calm me down knowing I can nap mid day tmrw if I’m having a terrible night tonight to at least feel human at some point. 2)A nap helps prove to me I can sleep and am not broken (I nap much quicker and easier than I do fall sleep at night) 3) a nap helps me feel less horrible and get rid of headaches and body aches associated with this Extreme lack of sleep. Hence they make lack of sleep less worrisome because I’m not as physically symptomatic All day. 4) they relieve a little of the psychological sleep pressure I put in myself at night. If I dont feel terrible going to bed, I don’t go to bed thinking “omg if I don’t fall asleep right away I’m gonna die and I can’t take another night.” Instead I go to bed like “I’m really really tired but I don’t feel like I’ll die tonight if I don’t sleep, just cry And that’s ok.”I don’t want to nap if1) it will hurt my progress long term.
Signal	The past week I've only gotten 3 - 4 hours of sleep a day. I limited my screen time, blue light filter, went out and walked in the sun in the day, made my room extremely dark, meditation, only going to bed when tired, not napping, making sure the room is cold, making sure I have a sleep ritual, making sure not to stress or do any work in my room, i even took diphenhydramine. I've done all of those, and especially today. I was happy, I thought I was finally gonna sleep, I fell asleep, woke up an hour later.... I'm desperate.
Signal	Do you ever feel like insomnia is going to kill you?I might jist be over dramatic but sometimes I feel like this is it, It’s going to take my life..
NotSignal	also let me know if any of you are struggling to sleep tonight so i know i’m not alone lol it’s 2:04 am for me and i gotta get up at 6.
Signal	Two reasons for my extreme chronic insomnia are...1. Layers of built up inflammation in my brain, neck, and stomach.2. I just learned I have severe anxiety.Also, I just moved to a new town because of my husband and in laws and my in laws hâte me... I've been married for a year and it's just getting worse with them, very anxiety -making.Anyway right now I take Valerian, Melatonin, Magnésium, Turmeric, Benadryl, along with teas and advil/Tylenol I'm considering CBD but I don't want to just treat the symptoms
Signal	i’m 22 and have been an insomniac since age 11, so there goes half my entire life being afraid of not sleeping at night, and what made it even worse was that when i told people i trusted at 11 abt it none of them believed me cuz i was “too young to have insomnia”well, that led to 5 years of untreated sleeping problems and a complete phobia of em, so i started abusing sleep medication, going even further into this cluster fuck of a rabbit hole!i want to change that, or better yet, i need to.. my psychiatrist is on to me, she knows i’m lying, i feel like i annoy her most of the timei have an appointment w a new therapist on monday and i just fkn really need to get my shit together and dive in to the mental health treatment w/o all this bs of mine but i’m scared shitless of actually “opening up my brain and seeing what hides inside it”
Signal	If anyone can help me with this ..! I couldn’t sleep more than 3 -4 hours a day and sometimes it’s get worse and I hardly sleep ... 2-3 hours in ... 3 days .! For sleep I am taking eszopiclone 2 mg .. every night for at least 3 months ..!
NotSignal	Okay, this is going to sound ridiculous but I'm going to share a trick that has helped me calm down at night. I'm sorry if this method sounds completely preposterous, but I'm being serious. Disclaimer: I am not a psychiatrist, therapist, or professional. Just sharing what has helped me the past couple of nights to chill the fuck out. When you lay down, most likely, your mind will begin to spiral. A technique that people use when negative thoughts begin to permeate your brain is "thought insertion". Basically, you force yourself to think of a positive thought and insert it into the spiral. HOWEVER, what I do at night is called "moo-ing". Okay, you're probably lost and thinking, this person is crazy. But stick with me. Instead of thinking of a random happy thought or whatever, I begin to "moo" in my head. Yes, like a cow. I will focus on the moo-ing and moo simultaneously as I breathe. I basically "moo" with every deep breath I take. This forces me to focus on one thought and my breathing. Naturally, my mind will begin to wander at times. Negative thoughts and worries will creep in. However, like meditation, I allow my thoughts to wander a little, but then I bring it back to the "moo-ing" and focus back on my breath. Remember, "moo" with your exhale or inhale over and over. It basically forces you to focus on a neutral thought and your breath. This might not lull you to sleep, but it has definitely calmed me down. Last night, I did this for a while and I felt a little at peace. Sorry if this seems like I'm trolling, but I'm really not. Just trying to help my fellow insomniacs. I know how hard it is. This isn't full proof and might not work for everyone, obviously. It might seem dumb and silly at first, but maybe it'll be something in your arsenal to alleviate insomnia. PS. I've tried "caw-ing". It works, but not as well as "moo-ing". I'm serious.
Signal	I grew up near here and discovered a dispensary called scmedicinals.Went and got some cbd for my insomnia.Edibles work great, don't cost too much.
Signal	I posted this over a year ago and the problem persists, so here I go again, hoping for different/better answers.I (25F) wake up several times in the middle of the night, usually between 3–7 times. I go to the bathroom and then go back to sleep. This has been going on for 7 years. It happens every single night no matter when I go to bed, what I eat or drink, what position I sleep in, if I'm at home or traveling, etc.I don't have trouble falling asleep initially. I don't drink caffeine or alcohol. I am otherwise perfectly healthy. I was tested for sleep apnea and it came back clear.Over the years, I've seen several doctors about this. None of them could figure out what was happening or help at all. The sleep doctor made me try CBT and it did nothing. Then he made me do some take-home tests (the EEG and other devices you wear on your head overnight). These apparently didn't reveal anything new. I wanted to do an in-law sleep study, but insurance wouldn't cover it. I tried melatonin last year, but it did nothing, even at triple dosage. I moved cities since I last saw that doctor, so if I see another one, I'd have to start from square one and I'm sick of that. I don't need sleeping pills because I was a very heavy sleeper before this.Most days I feel well-rested when it's time to wake up. But I'm still tired of this. I'm scared I'll suffer brain damage or other issues because I can only sleep an hour or so at a time. I'm asking Reddit because I don't know what else to do. There could be thousands of people reading this, someone must have an answer. If you can't help, maybe you can refer me to someone who can. I won't be young and energetic forever and I don't want this to go on for the rest of my life.
NotSignal	Has anyone here fallen asleep in the toilet ? please tell me I'm not the only who has done this a couple of times or so
NotSignal	its the dead mall series by Dan Bell on youtube. His videos are actually decent, but unless you are interested in walkthroughs of abandoned malls, you'll probably tune it out. Its good enough that I don't need to turn away, but not so good that I pay attention.
Signal	My panic attacks got so bad that the only way to stop them was to block out bad thoughts that gave me anxiety. And i did it by putting a lot of tension on the back of my head and the middle of my neck. It worked, I stopped having bad thoughts that led to anxiety, but then I couldn’t sleep, I lay in bed and my body feels like it knocks out but my mind doesn’t, i can hear everything, I have so many thoughts and I haven’t felt sleepy. This gave me so much anxiety that now I fear I will depend on drugs to sleep for life, I did have a horrible sleep schedule my whole life. Maybe it’s taken a toll. No matter how tired I am from running and lifting I just can’t sleep. I feel lost, my family is worried....I feel terrible. The only way I sleep is if I take hydroxyzine hcl 50mg. About 5 hours. I feel like I’m not going to live very long. This all happened in a week. I noticed I get heart burn when I first try to sleep and I think it’s my body that’s worried I might die. I feel alone, I’ve always been pretty strong minded and watched a bunch of relaxing videos etc and nothing. I hope this is temporary but it doesn’t seem like it
Signal	I've been having trouble sleeping lately (or really all the time) but I do go through periods where I sleep great. Anyway, I usually can fall asleep okay but I wake up at least once or twice a night and I never know what to think about when I'm trying to go back to sleep. Sometimes my mind is racing with anxiety, sometimes I just feel awake. But I never know what to think or do to relax and go back to sleep..any advice?
Signal	So work has announced work from home due to coronavirus and of course my insomnia is deciding what better time than now to stay up all night.It's like its able to fake it just long enough to help me be a passable human.
Signal	I have struggled with anxiety from the time I was 10, and have had trouble sleeping since then as well. Well, usually, I have no trouble sleeping, but sometimes I will start thinking too much and have 1-2 weeks of bad sleep. For example, this week, I have only been getting 5 hours each night. The reason for this is because whenever I go to bed, and start falling asleep (which is like, in two minutes cause im so exhausted), my heart starts beating fast and sometimes my whole body will jerk. And when I finally do fall asleep, its for 2-5 hours and I wake up not realizing I have slept at all. By the way, I take about 3-4 mg of melatonin every night because it helps me feel tired usually.
Signal	My sleep issues aren’t as severe as what others here are experiencing, but I’m posting this on as many sleep related subreddits as I can to get the most support. I’m 15, exercise every day, no coffee, no stress, I use night shift on my devices, my room is dark, I use the sleep cycle app, and I fall asleep just fine.For the past 3 months, I’ve kept on waking up in the middle of the night once or twice. It just started happening. I sleep 8 hours each night, but due to me waking up, I’m tired each day. I went to the doctor, explained I keep waking up, and he gave me a little sheet of paper explaining how to fall asleep fast. It wasn’t helpful as, again, I always initially fall asleep fine.So I’ve instead tried my own stuff. I’ve tried valerian, melatonin, GABA, and ashwagandha. All of these has studies done that concluded increased sleep quality or less stress. None worked.And as of last week, I’ve also started waking up 5:30-6 when my alarm is at 8. Again, I don’t know why.I usually go to bed at 9:30 and fall asleep within an hour. Unless I’m extra tired, in which case I go to bed at around 8.What do I do?
Signal	I don't even care if I die. I want to sleep. How much is a good price for heroin.text text text text
NotSignal	I'm done not sleeping. This is like the 4th time this week. What do I take? What can I take? Thanks. FML.
NotSignal	i’m tired i want to go to bed but tonight just isn’t the night. just been chatting with others on reddit for the past hour or two and don’t want to not have someone to talk to... other then that i’ve been staring at my wall just thinking of everything i still have to do in my life.. lots of thoughts. anyone else just can’t sleep cause they think to much?
NotSignal	For the last day in a half, maybe two days, i've noticed i had no urge to go to bed. I haven't had trouble falling asleep, atleast as of late. But i have to force myself to settle down and go to bed. I just haven't been feeling tired.I use my computer before going to bed, and i know that's a good indicator of sleep problems of some form. But i always have before, and it hasn't affected my ability to realize when i should head off to sleep.I have bouts of health related anxiety, and with other unrelated (to sleep) sensations. I'm starting to worry about neurological problems, i've been doing okay about handling my anxiety, i really don't want to relapse because of this :(.
Signal	My father (59) started working a job overnight for about the last month or so. He took it because it was a good opportunity, and after being unemployed for 8 months he was desperate to work again.But he’s having a hell of a time adjusting, and when he has to work he’s lucky to sleep for four hours during the day before his shift starts. He says he wakes up at the smallest sounds during the day and can’t fall back asleep.I’ve tried to get him to take melatonin, valerian root, even Benadryl, but it either doesn’t help him or makes him ridiculously groggy (something which he feels he can’t have with a new job).Any suggestions for helping him sleep/stay asleep during the day?I’m trying to get him an appointment to talk about prescribed sleep meds, but he’s very stubborn. I see how exhausted he is as well as stressed with a new job, and I’m so worried about his health. So any suggestions at all are greatly appreciated. Thanks!
Signal	I have had insomnia, night terrors, and sleep paralysis since i was a small child, even at 6 or 7 my mother would find me up reading at 3 or 4 am. Its been an accepted struggle my whole life.cut to 5 years ago i met (arguably) the love of my life, she was determined to help me with my sleep issues. I told her from the gate it doesn’t work like that but to my chagrin as we began falling madly in love with each other my issues subsided. No joke, if i could sleep beside her i would fall asleep within 10 or 15 minutes and the sleep paralysis and night terrors were reduced to a minimum. For the first time in my entire life, i could sleep almost like a regular person, 5 years of sleeping beside someone i loved so much. i would honestly look forward to the nighttime just to lay in bed with her an feel the sweet relief of knowing i was safe and i would get some rest. even if i woke up with a night terror or paralysis she would be there to comfort me and it was heavenly. i feel like mentally i made so many strides in those years, just because i was able to live a healthier life.Cut to abt a year ago we break up. its devastating it destroyed me, and like someone flipped a switch and cranked up the volume, everything came flooding back.Insane insomnia like being hospitalized weekly for exhaustion and needing fluids. If i could even manage sleep i would have nightmares 3 or 4 a night about her and our breakup. I couldn’t eat, i was self medicating with large amounts of alcohol nightly just to get even those 2 or 3 hrs if i could. i knew there would be nightmares but it was better than staying up all night thinking of her. i was dying from the inside out. i ended up getting very ill and needing invasive surgeries to remove cancerous tumors through out my body.now im in remission and the insomnia and nightmares were handled briefly in recovery due to radicalizing changes to my health and behaviors. But its almost the year mark of our breakup, and im going back to the place where i stay up for days on end only to crash. My weight has fluctuated so much this past year my doctor is concerned about the longevity of my thyroid health, and i dont see it getting better.it is so difficult to live a life like this, continually tired, no appetite, in a fog essentially. my exgf and i had such a terrible breakup but there are nights i am so low from not sleeping i want to crawl to her doorstep and beg her to just let me come over and sleep beside her. just for the peace, for the relief i would feel with her in my arms as i drifted off. i never believed it was possible but honestly she did it, she became the cure. i fear i will never meet someone else who i connect so deeply with they calm my worried soul like she did. Anyone else have that experience? Where you met someone who helped relieve some of this sleepless madness? i would love to hear your story, its 2 am here and ive given up any hope that tonight i will sleep. i am on day 3 with maybe an hours rest and i could use the company...
Signal	Had terrible insomnia as a child/teenager. Over the past couple of years I've been able to conquer it by following the same rigorous ritual: 1hr before bed the lights go onto the dimmest possible setting, I write in my journal, and I read for an hour and drink chamomile tea. I then take melatonin (5mg), turn out the lights and pray the rosary (not super religious, it's just a habit I have). I exercise daily. This worked.. for a while. Then suddenly, two months ago, a couple of days after a big operation I did not get a single wink of sleep. I meditated all night, didn't look at the time or my phone, and... nothing. The same thing keeps happening on a weekly basis. What's going on? Am I condemned to this forever? I think it could be that I put too much pressure on myself to sleep perfectly and I'm somehow psyching myself into not sleeping...
Signal	Hi everyone I’m having chronic insomnia sleeping only 3 hours or 2 hours at night and I’ve been prescribed Amitriptyline hcl 10 mg.Is anyone else on this medication? How effective is it for you ? Any crazy side effects?
NotSignal	ive been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately and it has started to affect my sleep. now i think for the past 2 nights ive experienced sleep misperception does anyone know how to fix this????? it scares me that ill have it forever someone please help and give me ways to treat it. its like i was sleeping but i feel awake still. im 16
Signal	I recently bought some zzzquil brand melatonin gummies and they help me sleep but they also give me really bad nightmares. I'm usually not a someone who gets nightmares often or is often afraid of things but these nightmares are a special kind of evil. Twice in a row I've dreamt of my dog that passed away a couple months ago horrible things I never want to think of. It leaves me feeling terrible. I haven't taken them but it's now 6am and I still can't sleep.
NotSignal	I've slept terrible past week, especially last three nights. My body feels likes it mildly burning. I've never had this insomnia symptoms before so all this is new to me. Have you guys had any similar symptoms?
Signal	I can't sleep at all or deep sleep. It's 5 am rn and I've drink meds but doesn't work. I'm so sad and frustrated it's one of those days
Signal	so im struggling with a huge lack of sleep since 2 months now(ever since this lockdown approx) and when i get a good night i feel like i could go back to sleep instantly, sometimes im even that tired that i can't eat etc.. is this a common sideeffect of the lack of sleep?
NotSignal	Well here we go again can’t sleep and really want to blow off tomorrow’s park meet ( we go to a big part and have lawn chairs spaced apart). I know they are starting to think I don’t like them or that I’m flaky.. but fuuuuuuuuuu.k waking up at 9:30/10 feels like a nightmare right now. 😞😞😞
Signal	I felt sleepy enough from 11 pm to 1 am. Took a 7.5 mg Zopiclone pill. Head to bed. Somehow I managed to become less sleepy and at 4 hours AM I got out of bed, took 100 mg of ZzzQuil + 3.75 mg of Zopiclone... its now 4:30 am and I am waiting and hoping for them to kick in... Hyperarousal is no joke. Anyone up?🙃Edit : I just realised that I took inadvertedly 2 or 3 “naps” of 20 mins while waiting for my sleep window to begin. So basically I got 40mins to 1h of sleep in my body, maybe a little less.
Signal	I wake up at the same time, every day, regardless of how I sleep so that's not the problem. My sleep has been getting worse to the point where I get 4 hours every other night or 3 nights of that in a row and then 3 normal nights. It's weird but it's schedule now. I do the exact same things, have the exact same thoughts and feelings but sleep well, then don't. I tried an all nighter a few weeks ago to try and fix it but that ended up in a rollercoaster of emotions. I've had Insomnia since I was little, but it wouldn't be as bad.
NotSignal	I wake up somewhere around this time and my mind starts going. It takes me hours sometimes to fall back asleep. On average it takes 2 hours to fall back asleep. How can I prevent this for when works starts in the future? I'm getting really sick of this.
Signal	Typically I'll take 100mg Trazodone and \~7.5mg Ambien nightly (I cut it to be about 3/4 the size). Sometimes I'll substitute the Trazodone for 7.5mg Mirtazapine. What I'm wondering is, has anyone else had a similar regiment that they were able to break? And is it really doing a lot of harm to have to take this medication? If I don't take it, I don't sleep at all. When I initially started using sleep aids, it was a miracle because my insomnia had become unbearable.
Signal	For years and years I've had sleep paralysis! It's made me scared too sleep for weeks on end sometimes. Drifting off and getting that feeling, seeing that thing. It's petrifies me to this day about 10 years down the line. A good night's sleep to me now is 5-6 hours. I struggle to find any more, and I struggle to get that sometimes.The sheer stress of it is making me feel so crap all the time. Don't get me wrong, sometimes I can figure out what's happening as the paralysis sets in and I can get up peacefully. But there are times where I wake up and struggle to figure out if I'm still dreaming. I can absolutely convince myself it's real only to wake up again. Then I get worried thinking if I'm dreaming or not.. I really need some advice, I dont want medication, I dont want something to send me to sleep. I want to fix it. I want my life back :(
Signal	I’ve tried a lot of different supplements to help me sleep and recently I gave 5 HTP a try and it’s incredible how quickly it makes me fall asleep! I’m actually surprised because I’m not very optimistic about supplements helping with insomnia. I took 50mg one night and noticed a difference right away. Then in the morning I took another 50mg and didn’t feel drowsy during the day but still was able to fall asleep quickly that same night without having to take it again before bed. I did wake up a few times during the night but it was easier to fall back asleep. Unfortunately it made my anxiety really high :( so I probably can’t continue taking it but for anyone out there who hasn’t tried this yet I would say give it go!!
Signal	I've been using doxylamine (OTC where I'm from) for a few months since my doctor told me to stop seroquel (pregnancy related). It's the kind of drug that at least gets me ~5 hours most nights instead of my usual 3. I've been feeling great and so I thought maybe I could wean off it. I'm done relying on a pill to do something that my body should be able to do by itself. I literally have no diagnosis that says my body is any different from a normal person.Anyway, I took half pills for the past two weeks and noticed zero change in how much sleep they gave me. Last night I ran out of doxylamine pills completely and didn't take anything for sleep. Fell asleep fine, woke up three hours later, just like I used to. There are too many variables to determine whether a pill like that acted as a placebo, so I'm just super frustrated. I go back to work today after a week of being sick with the flu, and I'm not interested in stumbling through the day. Why doesn't my sleep thingy work?
Signal	Hello Everyone,I will start with my story, so you guys can understand my experience in suffering from a severe depression for about 9 years and how I finally cured it. I am not a native speaker, so please don't treat my grammar too seriously. I don't think I am going to go really deep into my personal story, because it doesn't really that matter. All it matters, so you guys can finally fall asleep after reading that post. So, I suffered from not being able to fall asleep since I was 16-17 years old untli my middle twenties. Well, I can definetely say, Insomnia methodically, step by step, riuns your life. You are not even living, you just exist. The majority just doesn't understand how hard it is and they just say: "Well, you probably don't get tired enough throughout a day or you are just simply a loanger" or "It cause of stress, dude!", - and stuff like that. The statements like that just makes me mad. I tried for months to work out in a gym everyday for hours + studying hard at a university + working at office + jogging in the mornings. That just doesn't work like that, I still wasn't able to fall asleep until 6:00-7:00 a.m. or sometimes I couldn't sleep for days. Also, I tried doing literally nothing for weeks, I thought maybe doing nothing will not cause any "stress" and I will sleep well eventually. Didn't work either.I tried pretty much everything: melatonin, meditation, crazy sleeping hygiene, tryptophan, sleep restriction techniques, bunch of herbs, excessive sex everyday, retention from sex at all, breathing exercises, blue light filters, and etc. None of it worked! I don't want to go around a lot, I will just say that based on my personal experience that I accumulated for 9 years, there are only THREE things that really worked. It helped me and it also helped 5 people in my close environment who had suffered from insomnia for a long time as well. 1. Vitamin D defficiency. The whole population of the world is defficient of Vit. D in different degrees. Even Africans don't get enough from the sun (<30 ng) because they wear clothes like we do. Unless, you live in a tribe outside. Getting a RIGHT DOSE of vit. D is #1 treatment from insomnia. Many people just take 2,000-5000 IU per day and say that it doesn't help. Of course, it will not because even a SUPPORTING DOSE for a healthy person who has normal levels of Vit. D is 10,000 IU/day. The treatment regimen is simple. Buy a 50,000 or 60,000 IU Vitamin D at your local pharmacy or online and take it 3 times for the first week. Then for the next 3 weeks, take it 2 times a week. For the second month, take 50,000-60,000 IU once a week. After that you can switch to the supporting dose of 5,000 - 10,000 IU/day. As I remember, first day when I took 50,000 IU was the first day for long years when I was able to fall asleep right away and slept for a good amount of time. I woke up happy and full of energy. Finally!2. Magnesium defficiency. You can read about this mineral more in detail online but in short it helps your body to deal with stress and particularly with cortisol. If you are defficient, as a human you are not able to relax in general, neither throughout a day nor at night before sleep. Your muscles are always in tension and you just can't relax them. The treatment regimen is: 400-500 mg of Magnesium everyday, 30-60 minutes before sleep. Don't overdose it, cause you will have troubles with your digesting system.3. Excessive Consumption of B-complex vitamins. Well, it is a rare problem but it does exist in some cases and it did in mine. If you supplement yourself with different types of Vitamin B, check the % Daily Value on the back of your supplementation. It usually has WAY ABOVE of %100. The worst nights I had, when I didn't sleep even a single minute, I took a big dose of B vitamins on that day. Better to cut it off completely for the beginning and then after some time you can regulate the amount for yourself. In addition to say, there are B vitamins added in energy drinks, so just to think about that.Just try to follow these 3 steps and see what happens. It is important to do it in doses that I mentioned, either way it will probably not work. I am pretty sure it will help the majority of you. If it doesn't, then you probably have some serious psychological problems that lead to your Insomnia. In that case, you need to find a good psychologist. I wish all you guys a good sleep and happy life!Sincerely,ArtyBrew.
Signal	I often just can’t fall asleep but stick with my alarm the next morning. I wake up and feel fine for a few hours, but then I just can’t stay awake for the life of me. I always end up falling asleep during the day which makes it worse. However, if I turn off my alarm and let myself sleep late, I’ll wake up at 1 or 2 pm and it will be really hard to get back on a half normal schedule. Also, since the noise and light of daytime is happening I’ll usually get bad sleep and still be tired when I wake up. I’m honestly just lost I went to a sleep doctor and had a sleep study done which didnt really help and melatonin has stopped doing anything. Now I’m at a point where the birds are keeping me awake and I know that I’ll either be tired as shit tomorrow or I’ll set myself to be waking up at 3. I don’t have anxiety, I’m not nervous or stressed at the moment, it just feels like my brain just simply doesn’t make melatonin sometimes.
NotSignal	As the title says, whenever I try to sleep, it feels like bugs are crawling on me. I try to ignore it but it gets worse because then it feels like I am getting stung or something. Has anyone experienced something similar and knows how to stop it?
Signal	I started waking up in the middle of the night, multiple times, even, and find it hard sometimes to fall back asleep. I've tried everything I could think of and everything my doctor recommended to me.Sleeping Pills, Limiting Electronic use, breathing exercises, counting numbers and or sheep, going to the bathroom, sleep mask and ear plugs, but no matter what I still can't seem to keep myself asleep. Most of the time it is due to bladder related or needing to pee, even though I make sure to empty that completely before going to bed. Most of the time I am trying to not let it get to me but I am spending up to 40 minutes or so just laying my head on the pillow and waiting for sleep to take me again. It has led to frustrations between me and my bed but before that I had talked to my doctor about my sleep issues and the first night I did what he suggested and I had a perfect sleep without waking up a single time. But the sleep wakings slowly started to trickle back to me after that first night and now i feel like I'm back at square one but like I said this has led to the anxiety of me laying in my bed and trying to fall asleep and now it feels like even when I'm awake I'm worried about not getting any sleep that night. I feel sleep deprived and tired but at the same time my body just isn't cooperating with me at night and it's been a huge source of stress for me. It seems like no matter what I do I can't stop myself from waking up and when I do it is taking a long time for sleep to actually take me again, even though I know that I'm tired, exhausted, and need to sleep if I want to feel rested it still doesn't stop me from waking up and getting frustrated at myself in my bed for it.
Signal	It's almost 2 am and i still haven't slept. I have school tomorrow and i know how tired im gonna be. Everybody is sleeping rn and i just can't sleep.
Signal	My mom has sleep apnea and insomnia she can't stay asleep throughout the night. I can't find a way to fall asleep throughout the nights. The most I can do is when I used to go to classes on Monday and Wednesday I would have online classes due on Thursday and Sunday so most Wednesday's I would be so much more tired than usual that I would fall asleep 6 PM at earliest 10 PM at latest. And when I went into to school was 7AM for a 11:30 AM class, I usually tried to fall asleep around 3/4 AM since I need something. Since online classes start sleep schedule is way more fluid I don't usually fall asleep most of the time until 5 AM. And my sleep schedule gotten worse since Junior High I would start falling asleep around 1 AM to 2 AM then. And I do try to fall asleep I turn everything off take my glasses off stay in the dark with my eyes close and half of the time I am wide awake for a hour the other half I am tired but I am not tired enough to sleep. I have a small window of time in the night that if I fall get there I can fall asleep but if I miss it I am probably not gonna fall asleep that night. The worse I had was probably 12 hours of sleep in almost a week I just couldn't sleep at all didn't feel tired at all. I haven't even had sleep right now it's almost 8 AM and I am still wide awake
Signal	Have tried Hydroxozine, Trazodone, Ambien, and good ol' NyQuil. Everything leaves me a mess the next day or doesn't actually help me fall asleep, because it's all anxiety/panic related. Thinking about asking to try Ativan since it will actually address the panic/anxiety, and has a shorter half life.
NotSignal	When did it first started? Does knowing the cause help at all?
NotSignal	Was listening to a random interview on a popular podcast, and one of the guests mentioned using a brain retraining technique which has supposed efficacy in treating insomnia / PTSD and even brain injury. Big claims, and I'm extremely skeptical, but they seem to have a network of clinics around the US and some research demonstrating efficacy. Wondering if anyone's tried this approach? I believe the treatment is around 2,000 dollars, so not something to take on without many more positive reviews than I'm finding online. Suspiciously little user generated info available, but like most people on here, I'll try anything.
NotSignal	was sleeping good for a few days/weeks, but now just because i had a thought like : “what if i don’t sleep tonight”. Then i feel like i’ll just struggle a lot tonight. idk what to do.
Signal	My anxiety is possibly making me worry more then I need to do about some stressful situations. The result is some anxious insomnia.
Signal	Has anyone had any improvement in their insomnia after starting an SSRI? I have a new onset of insomnia within the last month or so and I know it started because of anxiety and stress now it’s only getting worse as the “sleep anxiety” has started to take over my mind.I was wondering if starting an SSRI willhelp once I start to feel better mentally, then maybe my sleep will improve as well? Anyone have any luck with this?
Signal	I have short intense stints of insomnia cause by anxiety, like 5+ days worried with zero sleep, then 1 night of fitful sleep, then 5+ days again. Eventually it causes headaches that don't subside. I took Ativan for a while to cope with it, but my memory got so bad that I stopped. I've passed my last stint though, I've been sleeping 8 hours every night and very very slowly but surely I've been getting better. My memory has recovered somewhat and my dark circles have subsided, but my memory isn't what it used to be... I'm only 22, I was hoping I was young enough to recover, but I'm scared my IQ and memory are permanently affected. Has anyone else has experience with memory problems? Does it get better?
NotSignal	Don’t force the sleep. Trust in your body to allow sleep when sleep calls out. Light a candle, take a bubble bath. Scroll through this subreddit and see everyone experiencing the same thing you are. You are safe tonight. Take care of your body. Stuck to a routine everyday. When sleep calls out, you’ll find a way to take the call. Peace and love. Sleep tight.
Signal	I’m trying to find otc sleep aids, but am reaching an impasse. Melatonin doesn’t work unless I take double the recommended dosage, and I can’t continue with that. I have limited success with ASMR audio, and lately can’t sleep until 4am. Does zzzquil work? I only need it for those days I can’t turn my mind off, but would like any input before I buy it.
NotSignal	it's not possible to stay awake until you just like, die or whatever, right? eventually your body will take over and make you pass out, right?
Signal	I just got a prescription for 50mg and started off with half a dose for the first two nights and tonight took the full thing. I am feeling strange now. Not necessarily sleepy like when I take NyQuil but strange like slow moving and I guess you could say dizzy? My vision is a little weird too. My heart is racing just a tad but it could be because taking new medicine makes me so nervous Please tell me if these symptoms are normal. Should I be worried? I’m sorry if I’m clogging up the page I’m just nervous
NotSignal	I can’t fall asleep until 4-5 am. I recently forced myself to wake up at 10:00 am daily for about 3 weeks, and it literally only helped me fall asleep an hour earlier than usual (slept 3am to 10:00 am for a total of 6-7 hours). This is not enough time for me to get adequate rest. So I’m wondering, if I just bear through it, will I start start falling asleep earlier, or will I literally get 7 hours of sleep indefinitely? It seems like at some point my body would adapt, but I don’t want to waste my time If it will only lead to being sleep deprived.TIA
Signal	I've been on and off Zopiclones for years but that metallic taste left in my throat is awful! Does anyone have ideas of ways to get rid of it? Thanks x
Signal	So, for most of my life I've had mild insomnia. Some days I can sleep perfectly fine, practically at will.Other days, it's just not possible. I can't do it. No matter what I do, no sleep comes. Even if my body should medically speaking be exhausted.For most of the week, I'm usually fine. I fall asleep around normal time before work. But, when Sunday comes around, I always have big problems.This is because I tend to sleep in over the weekend instead of waking up at 5am for work like I normally do. During the week, waking up at 5am always has me sleepy enough to fall asleep around 10 at night.So, with me sleeping in over the weekend, Sunday is always very very difficult to sleep.I'm in a predicament now.So, Sunday morning, I woke up at about 10am. Not particularly early, not particularly late. I proceeded to have a normal day. Then bedtime came around.Bedtime was about 8 o'clock, that's when I lay down and start winding myself down. Except I never wound down.I didn't sleep a wink Sunday night. I laid in my bed trying my best to stay still and fall asleep. I didn't fall asleep, as far as I can tell. I kept looking at the clock after long periods of failing to sleep. First it was 10. Then it was 1. Then it was 3. Last time I looked at the clock, it was 3. I was completely conscious 100% for sure until about 3am, but there is a slight chance I may have entered some light form of sleep after 3am, because time seemed to elapse extremely quickly and then my alarm went off at 5am. So I may have actually slept for 2 hours in some form, but I can't tell.Anyway, I had to go to work. I work in a factory, so it's really really really hard to work in a factory with sleep deprivation, especially at this level. Your body doesn't work right. I get nauseous, anxiety, aches, weakness, dizziness, gassy.. I had that all today, but I made it through the 8 hour shift.I got home completely dead. I'm still in the same position now because when I got home today I absolutely could not sleep either. I've been trying to fall asleep since 4pm today and it's 8:20pm now. I know my body is tired, I can feel it, but the sleep isn't coming. I'm not getting comfortable. My anxiety is running rampant, probably due to the sleep deprivation from the night before.If it continues like this, I won't fall asleep tonight either. And there is absolutely no debate, I can't go to work if I don't sleep tonight. That's really bad.I'm worried about my health a little. I'm having chest pains and feeling weird pressures in my body. I just want to get to sleep so I can go to work tomorrow. I have from now until 5am to make it to sleep.I need some suggestions on what I can do to fall asleep.I'm a Kratom user. Kratom is widely known to help sleep tremendously, and it does, but when I'm this anxious I don't like to take kratom because it either really helps the anxiety or makes it much worse.I also have some melatonin. Took 10mg earlier, and if didn't help me sleep at all.The only thing that seems to make me sleeping is thinking about sex, but I can't hold concentration. I'm serious, thinking about sex almost always helps me sleep but tonight it's not.So, do any of you insomniacs have any ideas on how to put myself to sleep? Would eating help? A shower ? I dont know.
NotSignal	Started 4 weeks ago, once. Happened few more times over the last week's. Yesterday maybe 5 to 6 times in a row (with 30 minutes wide awake in between), so got almost no sleep last night. Told my self to let the feeling wash over me with no struggle but in that moment that doesn't work...
Signal	Past two nights I had trouble falling asleep and when I did I felt like I was having weird half asleep dreams. Felt anxious throughout the night. In and out of sleep. Very weird. Does this happen to anyone else?
NotSignal	The best, most effective, and worst advice I’ve heard:You have to pretend like you’re sleeping to fall asleep.
NotSignal	Hello I’m having trouble sleeping After waking up in the middle of the night. Initially I don’t have problems going to sleep but when I wake up, say, three hours later, I’m unable to go back to sleep and if I do it’s a conscious sleep not a deep one. End up feeling restless. I often wake up unable to go to sleep with my body feeling jittery and awake. Will melatonin help with this?
Signal	I don’t know if this really even counts as insomnia? Basically my current schedule is: fall asleep around 7 am, wake up at 5 pm. I haven’t been able to properly sleep at night for years. I can only sleep during the day. It’s strange. Sometimes I’ll have to be ready for work really early in the morning, except I didn’t sleep at all the night before since i just laid there with my eyes closed for hours. I’ve tried to fix this sleep schedule a few times but to no avail. When I do fall asleep, I get awful nightmares. Been going on for about 4 or 5 years now with this bull crap. Vivid dreams every single night of my life almost. I usually remember them, always. I don’t know what it’s like to wake up feeling “refreshed”. Is that even possible? Are there actually people who can fall asleep without being assaulted by vivid dreams? Or can wake up in the morning feeling good and ready to start the day? Seems like a foreign concept to me sadly. I’ve just gotten used to being tired most of the time.
Signal	My first post in reddit. I know the pain of insomnia as it had bothered me for over 10 years. I've tried many different methods/pills and finally found a simple but effective solution. After like 1 weeks of practicing, now I can easily fall asleep and without waking up during the night. So I want to share so others may benefit from it.It's quite simple exercise, single leg standing with closed eyes (SLSCE), but it works! You can have all the theory about your insomnia, but at the end of the day, if you can't have a good night sleep, it doesn't help anyway.SLSCE, is very hard at the beginning to keep it long. Myself I could only hold it like 5 seconds. That's ok, just find your balance and keep doing it. Each session may be just a few minutes long. It's so simple that you could almost do it anywhere, anytime. I do it several times a day. Also, you can do it right before bed too. SLSCE maybe considered as a meditation. But I find it easier than the other form of meditation since you need to be very focus on your body to maintain balance when you do SLSCE, while in other form of meditation your mind is easy to wonder around.At the beginning, the reaction I got from doing SLSCE is a lot of burps/yawns, very interesting, it's the sign the body is restoring its balance. There are many other benefits of doing SLSCE.
NotSignal	I've been having horrible dreams, waking me up screaming. Honestly, they're nightmares/terrors, not dreams. I get anxiety about going to sleep, which then leads to insomnia; then I do fall asleep, for maybe 2 hours tops, and wake up screaming. I've learned how to drop back into dreams when awakened, so now I stay awake because I don't want to go back into them. I'll be up for 5ish hours, then by the time I'm falling back asleep, the sun is rising and the house is waking up (three kids). Luckily I have amazing partners who work with the kids in the morning (remote learning).I'm a full time student, two kids in school, and yeah, I live a generally stressful life; I'm in therapy and will be bringing up these more recent sleeping patterns this week. I wanted to know if anyone else has been having problems like this, and if how, if you have, overcome it.I'll gladly answer any questions, possibly dm, if they're too personal for me to answer publicly. Thanks in advance 🤘🏻
Signal	So i've always had a beef with sleeping, it was never stable and cyclical. I just sleep when i can't be awake anymore, and i just wake up when my brain decides.Which leads to me sleeping in times like 10 am, 12 am, 4pm etc... i do sleep at night sometimes too. And i've always beek struggling to have a stable sleep at night for exemple from 11pm to 6am. After a looooong time of trying not to sleep till tomorrow night and using techniques to get my brain to sleep at night like everyone i manage to have that stabl sleep, only for it to last about a week or and two and then it starts to shift more and more until i go back to sleep at hours that doesn't make sense.But thats not the main problem. What i've noticed is that.. when have a mostly regular cycle of sleep lets say from 4am to 1pm or 2pm i usually sleep a lot... like, 9 hours or 10 hours or sometimes 11 hours. But when i decide not to sleep and deprive myself from sleeping the next day just to stay awake till night and sleep at night (to try and regulate) i fall asleep around noon or close to the night around 4PM-6PM but i sleep waaaay less than i'm supposed to sleep, especially knowing that i'm sleep deprived and tired and normally i would sleep for long hours, but i only end up sleeping around 5 hours... idk what is it but it's killing me cause i'm 22 years old and sleeping has been my biggest issue.. i never succeeded in regulating it and sleep like normal ppl or wake up like normal ppl.
NotSignal	First time posting.I've been dealing with a lot of stress in my life. It's a constant, but I was still managing to get enough sleep.. untill the last couple of months. This month has been the worst. I've been maybe sleeping 1 to 2 hours every night. Sometimes less. Sometimes 30 minutes before my alarm goes off for work. My appetite is completely gone. I try eating and I gag/get dry throat. Sometimes I can but it's so little. I've mostly just been drinking meal replacements now. Seems to be all I can stomach. But I'm in a key management position at work and I keep arriving late because when I finally do manage to sleep, I sleep through my alarms. Until I suddenly wake up maybe 20-30 minutes after the fact. I'm so worried I'm going to lose my role because I can't sleep. During the time I'm awake I feel drunk. My body feels so damn heavy. I can't think straight. I know that my brain is in overdrive. I'm constantly making snap decisions and in the matter of seconds redirecting myself. I have 0 concentration.I was taking sleeping pills before, they stopped working. I tried pot and though it helped at first, it doesn't anymore. I drink after work usually. Before it took the edge off and helped me rest. Now I just lay awake.I've tried listening to asmr, rain sleep videos, anything I could find.I don't know what to do. I haven't seen a doctor yet. That's my next plan since everything else is failing.Is there anything else you guys have tried that helps?
NotSignal	I've been struggling with insomnia for as long as I can remember. I was as functional as I can be before but it's becoming increasingly difficult due to how busy I've gotten (new job, challenging field that requires me to be at 100% concentration). It takes everything from me and j feel like crap most days. I've done everything under the sun, except sleeping pills. I dont want to be addicted. Any tips??
NotSignal	This was happening on a ocassional night but now happens a lot more frequent, I fall asleep and wake up after 5-6h, then I try to fall asleep again, I have a dream and then I wake up 15-30m later and the same if I try to fall asleep again, why this happens? I just go to the bathroom without turning on the lights
Signal	Feel asleep with nothing, slept 8-1030, got up took 10 mg ambien, slept 11 to 1..Is this because I built a tolerance to otc medication? Is this withdrawal or something? Once I stop ambien will it be better in a few weeks?
NotSignal	Hello. 25F here. I need help. I live in a cycle of insomnia and hypersomnia. I explain : I will be to sleep during many days (usually 4) only able to take naps of 2 to 4 hours/day. After that I will fall in hypersomnia, sleeping like 20h/day for another 4 days. I don't know why and how to stop it. HelpPs : english isn't my first language.
Signal	Sorry for my layout, I just don’t care about it and I’m on mobile.Literally it all started with a dentist appointment early in the morning, that I stayed up all night for because I was so nervous. I smoked weed all night and chilled until it was time to go, and I wasn’t even that nervous! All that worrying I was so relaxed the entire time.... that is very strange from someone with social anxiety. But the day just got better and better with music and singing in the car and getting Starbucks and having sex. Idk man, I am aware of symptoms of mania but I might just need to go to fucking sleep if I ever feel tired. I’m everywhere
Signal	Between December and March I went through months of getting no more than 3 hours of sleep a night. I can fall asleep fine but then I wake up and my mind doesn't turn off. Not about important things. I'll be thinking of songs or cheese or something. Then I get anxious because I can't sleep and I can't sleep because I'm anxious. Lately taking Doxylamine succinate helps, but last night I took 50mg in three middle of the night plus melatonin and still couldn't fall back asleep. Now I'm anxious its going to happen again for months, any suggestions?
Signal	my brain just won’t chill out despite having taken 10mg of melatonin. it’s like a machine i can’t turn off that i seem to have no control over. the most random thoughts and words keep popping up in my mind that make no sense. this is probably due to only having gotten a rough 3 hours of sleep last night but it feels like i’m hearing voices. i know im not because this has happened before and it’s just my own cluttered thoughts being more noticeable without a distraction. despite knowing this it still manages to triggers my fear of psychosis and introduces paranoia to the list of reasons i can’t sleep at night. sometimes i’ll get an idea or figure smthn out and lay there obsessing over it until i write it down in the notes section of my phone. i know the blue light from the phone screen is probably another factor as to why i can’t fall asleep but if i don’t write down whatever was in my mind it won’t go away. even now as i type this i’m procrastinating attempting to sleep to make a damn redit post about how i can’t sleep which is painfully ironic in its own way. i’m also pretty sure the spike in insomnia i’ve been experiencing is because i had been smoking weed for about a month before running out and now being sober for about a day. though i know i can’t actually go through physical withdrawals i feel like i depended a lot on the drug to get to sleep at night and now that it’s slowly leaving my system i’m having to readjust and it sucks ass. i feel like it’s a combination of all these things that are contributing to my inability to fall asleep at normal human times. i’m not really sure how to fix this besides just waiting it out or trying to pull an all nighter to see if i can sort of reset myself and sleep at a normal time tomorrow night but even now i don’t want to put my phone down and close my eyes because my own thoughts freak me out.
Signal	I recently started getting insomnia around anxiety going to sleep. It's 1pm and I haven't slept since 11am although I might've gotten about an hour of sleep or less I wouldn't have a clue, and I am not tired at all, brains just a little foggy. Is this something that just happens when you are awake all night and try to sleep around noon and I would be able to sleep easier if I had a normal sleep schedule?Thought i'd ask here because that's kind of what you're experienced in.
Signal	I tend to always wake up feeling like I’m suffocating. I also have insomnia
NotSignal	i’ve been awake for (mostly) 3ish days now &i’m having such a rough time guys, it’s 7am now & i’ve been cleaning my laundry room for nearly 3 hrs out of boredom. the times i am able to sleep i’ve been having terrible nightmares that i’m glad i’m unable to remember. hardly seems worth it to attempt to sleep if that’s what it’ll result in. i know it’s not healthy but at the very least i’m actually being productive.
Signal	I've been getting super tired lately, but can't seem to fall asleep. I don't think I have insomnia, I came on here if anyone can tell me if I do or not. This started a couple months ago and I can barley summon the strength to type this.
Signal	When I say insomnia I’m talking two hours of sleep, and then zero the next day, then a little under two hours, then no sleep at all, and now currently it’s almost 2 am and I can’t sleep again. I’m doing random things I don’t remember, like putting something by mistake in the freezer etc. And I wrote an assignment for school with a bunch of typos and accidentally sent it. 🙃 I’m at the point where I’m crying out of frustration from lack of sleep. The insomnia has started happening again for about two weeks now but it’s just getting worse. My mind constantly races at night, it’s like a state of hypervigilance, yet at the same time everything feels slow motion.Things I’ve tried over the past few days:2mg & 10mg melatonin, Benadryl, sleepy time tea, not touching my phone at night, working out in the morning, wearing ear plugs, barely having coffee.I have bipolar and CPTSD and I feel like not sleeping can be really bad. I think I am paranoid too. Has anyone dealt with this? the lack of sleep purely being caused by anxiety? I’m an extremely light sleeper as it is, but this is definitely an anxiety thing. What helped you? Thanks
Signal	Jesus, I'm already in my fifth day without not a single hour of sleep and I've just lost hope, energy and everything... Today I was having some suicidal thoughts and to get rid of em I set myself to watch Fight Club, the first time I watched it years ago I would not have expected that now, the second time, I would feel so much empathy towards it's main char and plot because of this goddam trouble... And then I got curious... Would it work? Has anyone tried it?, I know this kinda unetical question but man... After trying pretty much everything you just get desperate...
Signal	I used to sleep 9 hours a night. Last time that happened was probably in September. Since then I just can’t sleep fine anymore. I was 17 when I used to sleep 9 hours and I realized I was oversleeping because I was always tired. So I started sleeping less. Something like 7.5 hours a night. Things were going great and then my brain just decided to self destruct or something idfk. I’ve tried EVERYTHING. Sleep hygiene is my main priority, I work out 7 days a week, and I have a very healthy diet. I’ve done an insane amount of research on sleep and still can’t fix this. Can somebody please help? I didn’t type this big ass paragraph for no reason
Signal	So I have a long painful history. Refuge from a civil war torn country. Even after coming to the states, my dad was a violent and abusive. Add asperger/autism and I was a lonely depressed child. All these added to making sleep a nightmare. Insomnia is my demon, considering all my terrible history. Self medicated as a young guy with alcohol. That didn’t help (understatement of the year). I finally got help thanks to my sister, who as you can imagine also suffers from mental issues. I saw a wonderful psychiatrist and he put me on clonazepam to help with the night terrors that keep me away and keep waking me up. Wow, this medicine is wonderful. I can fall asleep and stay asleep. I have a semblance of a normal life on it.Concern is tolerance. I went from .5 mg to 1 mg and sometimes need 2 mg. My doctor doesn’t want to up my dosage from 1 mg. I understand his concerns. I take the medicine ONLY to sleep as needed. So about 4 nights a week. I make sure to have an empty stomach.Anyone have tips to keep tolerance down. This medicine, in my doctors own words, is stopping my suffering. That’s why he keeps prescribing it to me. I don’t want to abuse it. It’s a lifesaver. I was going from no sleep and missing work 2 to 3 times A WEEK to not missing any days in the last 6 months. I’m functional. I use it only when I know in will get a full night of sleep.One strategy I saw was to take diphenhydramine before the benzo to increase the sedative effect. I won’t use alcohol to do that. Looking for strategies like that.Any help is greatly appreciated.
NotSignal	I took 2 Benadryl tablets once 2 months ago to fall asleep earlier. That morning I woke up after only 6 hours of sleep (I usually get 8-9). Every day since then I've been getting only 6 hours of sleep per night, and I feel a strong urge to sleep in the afternoon (but I try not to). How do I reset my sleep wake cycle back to normal (8-9 hours?)
Signal	So.. I am a 16 year old boy. I have a medium healthy lifestyle and I never really had trouble sleeping, but now suddenly I do. Last month I got my first sidejob and I stopped playing football. In the holidays I fucked up my sleep rhythm but I always do that, so that isn't the problem I think. I have only slept for 4 of the last 5 days now. Every night I try so hard to sleep but my brain is really overactive and I don't know why. I think now that I stopped playing sports and started working instead it's just too much stress for me, because I already have aspergers so I have a hard time interacting with others and a lot of sounds and other things annoy me. I think the problem is that I stopped playing sports, because now I realise that it is a really good way to clear your mind. I might also have a lack of Vitamin D because I don't really eat fruit and don't get outside often. I just wanted to share my story on this sub. I'm having a really hard time.
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for about 10 years. It first started when I was 28, I couldn’t sleep consecutively for 3 days , was worried , saw a doctor and was prescribed sleeping pills, when the prescription ran out I was back to where I started.Saw a therapist, muscle tension breathing exercises work very well. Fast forward to mid 30s , occasionally I’ve episodes of sleepless nights but didn’t bother me much, i wanna focus on my career and that’s all I care about . Naturally the condition took care of itself. I knew that I couldn’t sleep before 12 am so I used my phone till 2 am and eventually I could sleep. At the same I was introduced to melantoin not as a sleep aid but better recovery post gym. I was doing it for years , slept so well.Then last years melatonin stopped working, I went back to using phone till exhaustion. Things became bad last week , the longest I went without sleep was 3 days , did some natural herb pill by blackmores, tried breathing exercises and relaxing but all no use . I’m gonna sleep the today.In summary, sleep deprivation is bad for your health. But I feel that as long as you are alive , you have the hope of another to try something. Keep trying. Think of it like practising a sport or learning a skill. While most don’t have to learn to sleep, unfortunately we have to.Have a good day / night . Don’t stop trying
Signal	I haven't slept in three days now. Not even for a moment. My head is killing and my medication is doing nothing. I'm so fucking sick of people saying 'just go to sleep' yeah thanks so much why tf didn't I think of that genius idea. I'm so drained at this point and all I want is to go to sleep. Sorry for this just a rant.
NotSignal	I literally can't get out of bed for the full next day with 10mg of Hydroxyzine. Can anyone think of an administration route that might help this? Sublingual? Or is it just time to move on to the next medication?
Signal	I’m so damn tired of being so damn tired all the time. No matter what time I try going to sleep or how much sleep my body allows me to get I am constantly tired. I rarely have trouble falling asleep if i’m tired I actually fall asleep quite quickly. The problem lies with staying asleep. I wake up every damn 45 minutes to an hour, tossing and turning. Then I finally fall asleep again just to be woken up because I have to pee or because my dreams interrupt me. I’m getting about 4 hours of sleep total and I wake up everyday with a migraine. Hereditarily, my mom suffers from insomnia and migraines. She’s tried everything and truly nothing helps her, you can name every prescription, every detailed healthy sleep hygiene routine to achieve healthy sleep behavior, EVERYTHING. And she still suffers getting around 4 hours of sleep every night as well. I was never like her until a couple of years ago. I was sleeping 10 hours like a baby and sleeping through the whole night. What happened that all of a sudden i’m ending up like this. I. Am. So. Tired.
Signal	I’m a teen and I get really bad anxiety at night and am terrified of sleep paralysis. Whenever I try to go to sleep, as soon as I close my eyes and am about to drift off, I think of something scary and immediately jolt back awake. I can only sleep when it’s 6 or 7 AM and it’s light outside. I’m scared that bad things could happen to me if I don’t get enough sleep. My mom told me I need atleast 9 hours of sleep, but I have only gotten 2,3, or 4 so far the last weeks and if not those, I haven’t gotten any sleep. Is there anything I can do to help me get more sleep?
Signal	I’ve taken 300mg of 5-HTP and 9mg of Melatonin and they’ve done nothing but make me feel physically sluggish. I just started hallucinating and the walls don’t seem right, the noises don’t seem right, the shadows don’t seem right, my head doesn’t seem right, the lock on my door doesn’t seem right. I don’t know what’s happening. I can’t get to sleep. I won’t take Benadryl because I’m really sensitive to it and I’m always paranoid it’ll make me hallucinate before bed. I take a daily dose of 40mg of Vyvanse but skipped yesterday and the day before. My minds racing, I feel touching sensations all over my body. I’m scared to turn the lights off or to keep my back turned to anything for long. I’m honestly scared, this hasn’t happened to me before. I’ve never had hallucinations that weren’t because of something I took. On the 1st I smoked weed to try and help me sleep but it didn’t do anything. I don’t understand what’s happening right now. My chest feels like it’s caving in, my heart rate feels like an earthquake. Someone please help me calm down at the least. I mean no offense but I thought this may be the best sub for my issue.
NotSignal	Hi everyone, my first time posting in here. A quick bit of background on me and then i'll ask for some suggestions as I feel I am closer to cracking this than ever before now!I've had insomina for 17 years. I don't use medication, I dont drink caffeine, I work out, and have severe adult ADHD which makes my brain incredibly hard to shut down, and the falling asleep part of it all is where the problem has always been. I tend to get to sleep properly around 6am. but not for long as my girlfrien wakes up at 6:30. I actually survive OK but long for a good night's sleep like we all do!In May we had total blackout blinds fitted in our bedroom and it changed my world for a couple of months! I cannot tell you how much I recommend them for Insomnia sufferers! They were not cheap but so glad as for the first 6 weeks or so I was getting - not kidding - 7 hours of sleep per night!! I looked and felt 20 years younger within a few days. Amazing!Until about 5 weeks ago. I wake up at 4am on the dot and cant get back to sleep properly. I have a broken strange sleep if I do, and its so unbelievably annoying as I know I can now do it, and I just need those last few hours! Has anyone got any ideas, suggestions or thoughts on how to stay asleep for longer? Or is it because my body is so used to not having any sleep that my limit is 4 hours per night?
Signal	Sleep paralysis has made me terrified of drifting off into sleep so I always fall asleep by closing my eyes until I fall asleep without noticing. Whenever I feel my body drifting off but my mind is super conscience, I force my body to stay awake because of fear.Recently when I’ve been drifting off, I subconsciously just stay awake now but I get these headaches every time my body can’t drift off properly. Does anyone else feel this?
Signal	When the sleep aids that used to work gradually lose effectiveness and bring on anxiety attacks til all you can do is just lay there...Or is that just me?
NotSignal	Like it’s weird , some days it feels alright and other it feels like i’m resting my head on cement and it actually hurts my head. It hurts so much that I feel like a pain on the opposite side of my head. Does anyone have any pillow recommendations or types of different pillows that are beat suited?
Signal	I have had insomnia since like first grade I’m currently a sophomore in high school. I’ve always told my parents about my sleeping problems but they always had some stupid excuse for why I couldn’t sleep. I went to the doctors in elementary school for it and they just told me not to drink juice or soda an hour before bed. I did this and nothing happened. Now in middle school I completely cut out soda and juice and only drank water to see if it would help and it didn’t. My parents still don’t listen. I told my sister and she got me medication but that shit didn’t help. I still only get 3 hours of sleep if I’m lucky. I’m depressed too so that doesn’t help.I’m not able to pay attention in class enough to pass them so I’m failing and we’ve only been back for 2 weeks. I barley passed last semester. I don’t know what to do.
Signal	Around mid-April, I suddenly developed an intense fear of sleeping. I think the main reason I'm afraid is because I don't like the fact that you lose awareness when sleeping. I used to not feel this way. In fact, sleeping was usually the only thing I wanted to do in my downtime. Now I'm avoiding it at all costs. It's an intense fear; I often find myself staying up 24 hours or more because I'm afraid of sleeping and losing awareness. I have no idea what's causing this sudden fear, but I think it's something to do with coronavirus restrictions. I've essentially been trapped in my house since March and I've definitely gone stir crazy, so this fear might be a side effect of that. I've also found another reason I'm scared of sleeping is because I don't like dreaming. Mostly because I can't control them. Whenever I wake up, even if I don't remember dreaming, I always feel *something*. I don't know how to describe what I feel, but something is there. I've been wanting to try several methods of coping with this fear, from just closing my eyes and resting them instead of sleeping to trying to adopt an alternative sleep schedule. None of those methods have worked, obviously. Usually when I fall asleep, it's not because I wanted to. It's because I was trying to either rest my eyes or keep my eyes open and then I just slipped away. That's another reason I'm scared of sleep, because I don't know when I go to sleep. Again, I have no idea how to deal with this. I'm scared of taking any form of sleeping medications like melatonin supplements, again, because I'm scared of sleeping. Can anyone please help me?
Signal	i know i don’t have actual insomnia but still its like my body doesn’t like sleep i’ve had had eye circles forever and sleep takes a very long time because my brain will take some random sentence and say it 1000 times as if its trying to get under my skin so sleep takes hours but i always fall asleep eventually which i why i feel wrong for bitching on this sub and i have never sleept in, i always wake up early even if i go to bed a 5am my brain knows when its morning i never nap and coffee doesn’t effect me so im always tired not dangerously tired more like inconveniently tiredi don’t know what out come or advise im really expecting from this i guess i just wanna vent but like i said i know i don’t have insomnia id obviously never get any prescription but i still have to go to be early because i know i will wake up a sunrise but i also can not go to sleep early like i mentioned its like my brain avoids sleep i still get sleep and in theory i technically get enough but im always so tired
Signal	So this is a little embarrassing, i’m 17F, and live at home with my parents. Ive suffered from depression and anxiety since I was around 11 or 12 and a consequence of this is pretty significant sleep problems. My mum has always stayed with me at night when i’ve been feeling down, and I guess it’s kinda created a habit and now I can’t sleep without her. I want my own space as much as she does, and every night I really really try to get to sleep by myself: Ive bought a big pillow to hug, an aromatherapy diffuser, made my room comfortable and even take an antihistamine before bed to help me get to sleep, but nothing works. I will toss and turn until 4am when I finally get so anxious about my lack of sleep that I have to call my mum. Its so embarrassing and I really need it to stop since i’m almost an adult, but I just don’t know how? Anyone got any tips?
NotSignal	I'm specifically talking about during the night here! If you have trouble staying awake during the day then you might have circadian troubles or some other condition. I have to go to bed at 2 am and wake up at 7:30am. The problem is I've run out of things to do until 2am. I don't want to do anything over-stimulating, like go for a jog or do work. I also don't want to do anything under-stimulating - listening to an audiobook, podcast, music - as I find myself at great pains to keep conscious. If anyone's also going through this therapy it would be good to hear about things you've tried that have worked.
NotSignal	This has been bothering me for the entire night, and now it's 7 AM and I still can't sleep. Does anyone else share this same issue?. I don't believe i have had any sleep issues recently, but this has kept me up for so long, and I'm concerned.
NotSignal	I'm asking this because I've shown signs of Insomnia since I was 5, but didn't know why, but a few weeks ago I saw a bottle of pills with my mom's name on it prescribed for Insomnia. It made me wonder if Insomnia was genetic or not.
Signal	Ive been taking trazodone a few months, and while these pills usually knock me Out, I almost always feel EXTREMELY depressed before I go to sleep. Has anyone else experienced this?
NotSignal	Oh, I didn't sleep all night! That's good, it means I'll sleep really well the next night!Next night: Doesn't sleep all night.
Signal	Im always yawning and want to sleep yet I've been awake for days with only laying in bed trying to sleep for hours upon hours. Im legit scared why is this happening, im freaking out
Signal	I’m really struggling right now. I’m 50. Female. Just starting menopause. Haven’t been able to sleep right for 15 years now. I do all day or all night resets all the time. I have ambien and benzos and they knock me out for 12 hours. I am either up 30 hours or asleep for 12-14. I can’t nap. I go all the way out. I can’t just stay up, I’m brain dead and can’t do anything simple if I do. My normal right now is get up at 4 pm and get sleepy at 8 am. I have no idea how to reset this. I’ll get it right for a week and it’s off again in the next. I think hormones are the problem. They won’t give me replacement therapy. I can’t make/keep appointments. I couldn’t wake up if the house were on fire. I have good sleep hygiene. I haven’t seen a sleep study person. I’m angry. My husband doesn’t understand and hates me for it. No one understands.
Signal	So i’m a 19 yo first year in college and this quarter i started to have really bad insomnia from what i think was stress about being back at school. I got a short term klonopin prescription and started going to therapy at my school, but the problem isn’t going away. every monday night i’m up all night unable to sleep, which is weird because other nights i can usually fall asleep by 3am. But monday’s are particularly bad. Every time i’m about to fall asleep I jerk awake, which i think is hypnic jerk, but i don’t know what to do about it. Should i ask my therapist to refer me to a psychiatrist or sleep doctor? thanks for any advice.
NotSignal	I've been having sleeping issues since april that have been getting progressively worse. I first stopped being able to recall dreams, started struggling with memory even stuff like my own age and birthday at times(I'm only 22 years old). I'd just genuinely feel off and the amount of sleep I got went downhill fast and has lead to days where I just don't sleep 2-3 days in a row. Fast forward to now, I wake up feeling drunk/high all day(I don't drink anymore or do drugs, but do act like ppl who have) until I go to sleep, feel very dizzy and lightheaded have trouble walking straight and having a conversation. My body feels light and I constantly feel like I can drift back into sleep but can't. I ended up nearly passing out and bumping into stuff at the store and for people kept asking me if I was okay. Do you guys have any tips or advice or things I should do to figure out what's wrong?I practice good sleep hygeine.Sleep restriction sleep window from 11:30pm to 6:30am.I did a sleep studyI exercise/eat right/stay hydrated/etc.Nothing seems to work.
Signal	I can never sleep. I’m up until 6AM every night and then get up at 8AM. I think I am dying. I don’t remember the last time I slept normally. I think it might be my antidepressants.
Signal	It’s been 33hrs since I last woke up and I went to work with 0 sleep. I came home to try and sleep but I physically can’t... im so exhausted tho it doesnt make sense! Please help im desperate!
NotSignal	Currently 550am and still haven't slept. Probably won't sleep until night time tonight. Since the pandemic I've been wfh and have been having coffee here and there. My sleep schedule has been difficult when coffee is involved. Today broke the camels back. I had a kcup Friday morning and it's Saturday morning and I'm still unable to sleep.Every time I try to sleep my mind is wondering and I am getting some sort of anxiety. I tried to read a book to sleep, a boring book about commercial leases and still no success.Today I say bye bye to coffee and going straight to decaf. I can't believe I had a sleepless night.
Signal	the amount of melatonin my mom has test trialed with me is more than my fingers and toes. none ever seem to work consistently. usually they don’t work at all and the rare few will work ONCE and stop. any tips for some good hard ones?
NotSignal	I have always been a bad sleeper but the last month takes the cake. When I go to bed (around 0:15), I am comfortable and I get into this phase where I’m knocking at sleeps door. Then roughly an hour later (at around 1:15) I become more awake and usually annoyed that I am not asleep yet. After that it takes me 15-30 min to fall asleep. Any idea whatsoever what this might be? I am at the tail end of an anxious period and I am not really stressed anymore.
Signal	Like when I have hypnic jerk it comes with anxieties. But today I do have anxieties yet I still have hypnic jerk. I’ve been in bed for five hours and can’t sleep!
Signal	Hey, so I've been lurking for a long time now. English isn't my [20f] first language etc. Based in the Netherlands. I have had trouble sleeping for all my life, it started when I was a baby. It's had some ups and downs, but I could never pinpoint what the changing factor was. Last year my psychiatrist described me medication (temazepam), which just kind of made me a weird version of myself. It kind of shut off my brain, but made my body weirdly active. A bit like sleepwalking I guess? But then with me actively talking alongside with it. And awfully clingy.Other medication (topiramaat) made me hallucinate for a bit, and didn't help me sleep either. Anti psychotic medicine didn't help either, they just.... didn't do anything? I've stopped trying to find a medication that will work, as I lost hope. So I hope to find some hope back, by writing this post. My therapist doesn't know a lot about insomnia, and I'm just so tired of not being able to sleep properly. He told me he will try to figure something out for me, but all the things he came up with, are things I've tried hundreds of times. I usually am awake one night, and then the other night I'll get around 4 hours of sleep. Sometimes sleep might not hit me untill I've been awake for about 72 hours, and it f*cked up my life. I also have ADHD, which I don't take medication for (as the medication made my sleep even worse) and I think this might be why my body responds so weird to stuff that's supposed to make me sleepy. Does anyone have tips to make my therapist take my insomnia more serious? Does anyone recognise my story? Or does anyone have tips regarding insomnia and ADHD, being a combination?
Signal	So my insomnia started about a month ago. I have a pretty normal life style. No stress, nothing to have anxiety about. One night It happened that couldnt sleep and freaked out that I would not have enough sleep. I stayed up the entire night. The day after I tried to make up sleep but I couldnt either. That continue for 2 days. I tried Zquil, melatonin. They didnt work. Cbd oil work once and stopped working the day after. Sleepy time tea didnt help. Intensive exercise didnt help. I had 2 weeks of sleeplessness and starting to loose my mind. (No sleep, not even one hour). My body was very tired but my mind was wildly awake. And even if I slept for 5 mins. I was aware in my dreams because my brain just didnt shut off. Note that the pandemic does not effect me one bit and I amNot stress out about anything( its hard to believe when I told my doctor that, they basically said then wth is your problem).My doctor put me on ambien but they said other than that there was nothing else they could do. Basically they told me to get on with it and get off within a few weeks or i will get addicted. Its all psychological. So I said f*** it either that or I died of sleeplessness. One time my doctor recommended hypnotherapy. Now, there will be people who believe in hypnotherapy and people will dont. It’s all because if you are susceptible to hypnotherapy or not. It will work on some people and wont on some. I am super susceptible to hypnosis. I know this because my husband practice magic (sleigh of hands, cards and tricks) so he hang out with lots of magicians. One of them is a hypnotist. I, by no mean believe in hypnosis before until be perform it on me. Its something out of this world that you either experience it or you dont. So we contacted him and had a section of hypnotherapy. Its wildly expensive but I was so desperate so I was willing to pay anything. It was over zoom. He did some hypnosis on me on the section (in the morning) and basically said I would be able to sleep that night.To be honest I did not believe him. That night I still have to take ambien so I was like oh it didnt work. The night after I sleep till 2am without any drugs and I was amazed how I could fall asleep. But I took ambian after because I couldnt sleep again after I woke up. The night after I fell asleep without knowing or drugs and slept through the whole night. And I have been sleeping well for a week and a half without ambian and I could not believe that is actually happening. I was seriously considering taking ambien for the rest of my life. I have given up on the thought of normal sleep. It works! If you have tried everything and nothing works, please consider hypnotherapy. But you have to make sure you are susceptible to hypnosis. If you are not, it would not work. You will be wasting your money. Hypnosis works on me but not on my husband one bit. Even if he really want it to work on him. And please find a reputable hypnotist. There are so many scams these days online help or whatever that Im not even sure wtf they do. And yes, it will be expensive, I consider it a medical treatment for my sanity. So it was fine.Anyways I hope this helps. No one understands the suffering unless they have been through it themselves. I know how you feel. I hope this willHelp you sleep.
Signal	If anyone could give me tips on how to sleep easier it would be massively appreciated, currently 4 am and I’m tired but can’t sleep.
NotSignal	I'm gonna have to force myself to be productive because I have so much to do. My problem is that I feel like my brain cannot function whatsoever because of the lack of sleep.
Signal	I havent slept yet. Im so tired but not sleepy. My boyfriend has been asleep next to me since 11pm yesterday! Cheers to trying again tomorrow.
Signal	Every night I’m up past 4 no matter what I do throughout the day and before I head to bed. With school, I am exhausted throughout the day then suddenly at night, I’m wide awake. Is this even insomnia or am I just bad at sleeping.
Signal	19m,Cannot fall asleep before 6am, spent on average 2-3 hours per night just to fall asleep. I feel like trying to fall asleep is a gruelling task everyday. Yet I also experience daytime drowsiness and do not feel motivated and cannot complete any daily task, which is really bothersome. Any help or suggestions?Ps Not under meds, feeing stressful but not aware of any mental conditions.
NotSignal	I realize there is not really anything fun about insomnia, but I would love to hear what you guys do in the middle of the night when you’re not trying to fall asleep.Anything fun? Productive? Totally random but entertaining? I currently alternate between binging Netflix, scrolling through all my social media accounts, and doodling.
Signal	I’ve always had trouble falling asleep at night but not to the point of no sleep at all. Within the last month or so my sleep has gradually gotten worse every night to the point of laying awake almost all night long. If I do fall asleep I only sleep short periods of time and wake up constantly. And when I am sleeping I am dreaming so heavily that it doesn’t feel like I’m actually sleeping at all. I’m trying everything I can including getting to bed the same time each night, no distractions like tv or phone, wearing an eye mask, making the room dark and comfortable, drinking sleepy time teas, taking melatonin, etc... Nothing seems to work. Even if my mind is super calm without racing thoughts, it still won’t turn off and go to sleep!! Then by 5am I hear the damn birds chirping and I know I got no sleep and I get really frustrated and feel like a zombie all day the next day. Any tips for new onset of insomnia? I’ve had horrible anxiety this entire time during the pandemic so maybe that’s what caused the insomnia. But even now as I am feeling better and less anxious I am still suffering with the insomnia. Also, daytime naps are impossible for me, especially now during the summer.
NotSignal	Is it okay to feel so afraid every once in Awhile?. It lasts for a few days but it happens suddenly without any obvious reasons.. somehow my mind always tries to scare me wether by having pretty sad feelings like guilt and regret or by having nightmares every time i try to sleep.. I guess it doesn't even have to be a nightmare.. i imagine a lot of bad situations right before sleeping and that prevents me from having a deep sleep.. and also.. what do you guys do with *IBS*?.. it gets so bad with any kind of vivid feeling.
NotSignal	It's been almost 40+ hours since I woke up last time and now I'm struggling to even shut my eyes. It is 4.30am here and surprisingly I feel relaxed and chill (maybe a tiny bit anxious when I start thinking about how long I've been awake). I'm a night owl by choice but even for me this sleep schedule is quite abnormal
Signal	My doctor has prescribed me both for sleep in separate occasions. I didn’t feel like promethazine was a good idea as I use it with my chronic migraines and didn’t want to build a tolerance for when I’m feeling ill. I’ve been taking hydroxyzine 25mg for a month now and it’s helped but I’m worried about long term issues. I’ve been taking melatonin but have been advised against it as it builds tolerance. Any advice?
NotSignal	I’ve been reading “Man’s Search for Meaning,” by Viktor Frankl and came across this section that I thought you all might find interesting.“Anticipatory anxiety… produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid. An individual, for example, who is afraid of blushing when he enters a large room and faces many people will actually be more prone to blush under these circumstances.”“Ironically enough, in the same way that fear brings to pass what one is afraid of, likewise a forced intention makes impossible what one forcibly wishes”“Logotherapy bases its technique called “paradoxical intention” on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.”“Let me recall a case. A young physician consulted me because of his fear of perspiring. Whenever he expected an outbreak of perspiration, this anticipatory anxiety was enough to precipitate excessive sweating. In order to cut the circle formation I advised the patient, in the event that sweating should recur, to resolve deliberately to show people how much he could sweat... The result was that, after suffering from his phobia for four years, he was able, after a single session, to free himself permanently have it within one week.”“Paradoxical intention can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessness results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is to stay awake as long as possible. In other words the hyper intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep which soon will be followed by sleep.”TL:DR Try to stay awake and you will end up falling asleep.
Signal	Yea Im not sure why my brain isn't letting me sleep anymore. Can only sleep for like 2 hours and it's unresetful sleep...... I'm panicking and don't have health insurance atm. I need pills or something cause my brain is killing me literally. No REM sleep on 4 weeks..... FML
NotSignal	I keep telling myself and my friends that “I’m going to sleep” but here I am overthinking everything and crying over things that happened in the past— I also miss my doggo rip hdkdhdkdjdkd
NotSignal	I very rarely wake up after 6 o’clock no matter how late I sleep, even if I go to bed at 10 or 2 it makes no difference. It’s honestly very annoying and idk what to do
Signal	Fuck me man, I feel like shit I'm so stressed out I dont know what to do anymore, fuck insomnia, sometimes I feel like I'm gonna kill myself because of it. I'm so fucking stressed out I just want it to end. Please I'm asking for help, if you got any tips on what I should do
NotSignal	I like to watch heaps of shows, as something to pass the time through the night as I'm alone. Looking for suggestions on 'binge worthy' series. I'm currently rewatching Game of Thrones, and have just finished (almost) season 1 of both Killjoys and His Dark Materials. I like action packed, violence and horror. However also love a good story with well built characters, and have a special place in my heart for anything set in the 18th-19th century.
NotSignal	I'm 13. I've never ever dealt with Insomnia this bad until now. I slept 4 hours last night and it's 4am this "night" again. Going to the toilet, I'm remembering rooms differently, I'm questioning everything. I feel so disoriented and like an outsider to the world. My normal wake up time for the Quarantine is 8:30, so I'm going to try to wake up then to keep a schedule, but it's going to hit me like a brick wall in the morning. Help.
NotSignal	Its 4 am. If Im ill (even if it is casual flu) it pressures me to sleep more which makes me have sleep anciety and unabe to sleep. On top of that im freakedmout at being ill fore the previous reasons.
NotSignal	Idk how to explain but I had sleeping problems from like the start and I don't know how to fix it. I don't take any medicine because I don't wanna make it worse. I literally tried almost all of those stuff I found on google but nothing works. If you want to give me an advice about taking medicine I don't think I will because I really don't want to use it but im guessing there is no other way
Signal	When I was around 8 years old, I started having problems with my sleeping. At first, it was minor, then it decided to go batshit crazy waking up and going back to sleep every time. My mom decided to put me on sleep meds just to let my brain shut tf up, I used to take 3mg of melatonin then 6mg and finally 10mg. I used to be on Trazadone 100mg but then I stopped getting the meds and had a crazy withdrawal to the point where I was walking outside just to take all of my energy and put it in my bed. Now I take 10 mg melatonin and generic sleeping aids. But the problem is I stay up at around 1 am just because I don't like sleeping, and I like to listen to music and watch youtube videos if I don't wanna sleep. My worst case of not sleeping enough is I went to bed at 1 o clock then later at 5 am my brain decided to let me fall asleep. This was one of the worst nights I've ever had. I'm doing ok right now, I changed my sleeping schedule from 1 am to 11 pm and learn to relax more. If you're having sleeping problems, my advice is to relax for a good amount of 30 minutes after you take your meds that your doctor prescribed or over the counter. Then turn off your electronics and put something that relaxes you, my personal favorite is my fan, and it creates a white noise for your brain to relax more. After that, let your mind flow and relax. Don't force yourself to relax because that's not gonna help at all, and most importantly, never look at your clock its gonna build even more stress for your state of mind. You could use your personal choice of my advice I don't care lol, as long as if you had enough sleep, I'm happy you got enough to sleep for tonight.
NotSignal	I completely forgot how much work a puppy was, especially at night. Would you think getting a puppy is a good idea for an insomniac because they can take care of it since they don’t sleep, or no because it would be another worry for them? I’m starting to think it’s a little bit of both.
Signal	I’m really going through an awful patch right now and got prescribed Trazadone 50 mg but it made absolutely no difference—I just stared at the ceiling for hours again. My doc says she has lots of people on it that love it. 1) why is my broken brain this way and 2) has anyone else experienced this?
Signal	I have a thing called an acute insomnia. I've started at my new job this month, it's a dream job for one of the major companies in my country. I've always wanted to do this and I want to prove myself and everyone around me that I can do it well and that I really am good enough for this position and the company.The thing is... I'm both super excited about the work and really stressed. It makes me incredibly happy, yet I fear so much that I'll fuck something up there and lose this great opportunity that I'm just incredibly tense.I can't sleep... I just can't. The first day, I slept for about 4 hours, which wasn't that bad. During the first week, I slept less than usual, but I still could get some sleep and some nights were even good for me. But something happened after the Easter holiday, and I can't get used to this again.Last week, I had two absolutely sleepless nights and three nights with lesss than 3 hours of sleep. Then I just spent the whole weekend in my bed, catching up on that missed sleep.On Sunday, I had another completely sleepless night and yesterday, I slept for fucking 2 hours... I have these huge black circles under my eyes, I'm super pale, I feel sick and like I might just pass out any second, yet I can't fall sleep, no matter what I do.Last night, I fell asleep at like 9 a.m. but then woke up after just few hours and stayed up for the rest of the night. This lead to something like a panic attack. For real, I just got so scared of not being able to function well at work and getting sick from all the missed sleep that I got a panic attack in the middle of the night and woke my boyfriend up, who then had to calm me now, when I was crying like crazy. Today, I'm just literally too scared to go to sleep. I'm terrified of sleeping now. I don't know what to do. I called my doctor today and she gave me some anti anxiety pills to help me calm down, she said I was too young for sleeping pills. Right now, I don't know if I should take the pills or not. I fear that they might make me sleepy even the next day at work, and I just can't be that. Plus, they're just anti anxiety medicine, not really sleeping pills, so what if they won't even work? Jesus I need some help, I swear this is torture.
Signal	This has been a problem thats only gotten worse as I’ve gotten older. It takes forever for me to even fall asleep, and I’m a SUPER light sleeper. I don’t go into deep sleep. I sleep in pitch dark. I have blackout curtains. I’ve tried smoking myself to sleep, doesn’t do anything. I don’t have TV on or mess with my phone when I try to go to sleep. Although some nights, I do give up and pull an all nighter and just watch some shows because if I’m gonna be up I may as well keep myself entertained. I’m exhausted all through the day, and it sucks. Melatonin is basically like a sugar pill for me. I’ve tried OTC sleep aids. I’ve tried all these natural herbs and supplements. I’ve tried tons of medications. The only thing that’s ever been able to knock me out are benzodiazepines, which i have borderline personality disorder so i qualify for them, but the doctors in my state are weird about prescribing them now because of all of the abuse, so it’s very hard to get it. I don’t know what to do anymore. The nights I can fall asleep, it’s just like I get woken up by a pin drop it feels like. Some nights i will sleep not at all, some nights maybe 4-5 hours. Sometimes I’ll get 7, but it’ll be light tossing and turning sleep. It’s never good either way. I’ve tried to talk to doctors about it and they just pass me off like it’s nothing. Blame it on my phone or something stupid when I’ve told them it’s not like that. Like, I had this issue before i even owned a phone. Or they tell me to just relax. Yeah well it’s much more complex than that I guess. I feel like I’m out of answers and sleeping well isn’t gonna happen for me.
Signal	I've developed an extreme paranoia ever since the insomnia has grown. My friends are starting to think I'm crazy. I kind of held it in, because I have so much shit I don't really feel comfortable to talk about.I'm paranoid of my friends. Like somehow my sleep deprived brain has convinced me they're out to get me. And I am paranoid of my family too.Even my partner. (Self aware.)I drag the sleep depriveness out and let it consume me. Till I'm too tired to function and I knock out.Esperanza.
NotSignal	How do you guys stay motivated/focused on doing work when you get less sleep at night?I get \~5-6 hours of sleep but wake up feeling groggy and cannot function the whole day. I stopped drinking caffeine a while ago and now only drink water/juice throughout the day.
Signal	Why did this happen? I was still watching him play when I woke up, but I woke up totally disoriented. I feel nauseous and my head hurts bad, now my stomach is hurting. I wake up every 1 1/2 - 2 hours every night but not one hour. Typing I also see blue or indigo aura around my keyboard, which I’ve never experienced before. What’s going on here? Why did I get sick while sleeping? Is this normal for not being able to stay asleep? I didn’t even have a reason to wake up. All I want to do is sleep. Fell asleep at 1am now it’s 2am for context.
NotSignal	To those hardcore and long time insomniacs, how do you manage to live your life on 2-3 hours a day? Do you have any tips on how to face life everyday with such little sleep?
Signal	Hello. I have got insomnia usually I sleep 5 hours, sometimes 7 or 8 or even 1-2 hours. This night I couldn't sleep because I was very sad i had a conversation with my mother about life on top of that I watched True detective before I went to sleep. Watching true detective gave me sad depressive mood and my mother just increased my anxiety. I'm tired I just walked 4000 steps. But I wanna walk more but I got chest anxiety that's keeping me down. I think I'm about to die if walk more. I can't take a nap lost ability to do it, I only can sleep at night. Yeah, weird post I'm not native speaking English man.
NotSignal	So ever since I was younger my body has been able to run on very little sleep like a what seems to be a harmless 15 minute nap will mean that I’ll be staying up till 3am. I have no idea what happened to make my body so weird when it comes to sleep I’ll heat up to over a hundred I know it’s normal for people to heat up when they sleep but for me if you even got near me you’d feel the heat. It’s just a normal thing that I’ve dealt with. My mom thought about taking me to the doctors for a sleep study but that never went through I would like for that to have happened to see if I do have a disorder. But nope my mom’s solution was put candles in my room that are supposed to make you fall asleep.
NotSignal	I was managing to fix my sleep schedule slowly sleeping at 3:00 AM and waking up at 10 AM, today for some reason I woke up 11:00 AM, now I can't sleep and showing no signs of tiring out, just sharing an interesting fact, something similar happened to anyone before?
NotSignal	Decided to not focus/worry about sleeping at all and do my own thing. Unsurprisingly I checked the clock and it was 3:30. Decided to check when sunrise was and stayed up since there was no point in trying to sleep again. I got changed and took a walk at 5:30 for the sunrise. Realized I missed the sunrise but I’m still sitting in the park bench enjoying the morning. My troubles cause some beauty involuntarily :)
Signal	I just need to vent. It's been a week and I've been having such irregular sleep patterns. I sleep from 7am-2/3pm. I stay up all night. I can't sleep and I have such a hard time. I forgot what it feels like to sleep at night. During the day there's always some kind of commotion. I feel safer when I sleep during the day when people are up and around. It's 5:52 am right now, so I can't sleep until 9pm or some reasonal time so I can get back to a normal pattern. This is very frustrating.
NotSignal	I just cannot sleep right now. So far my brain has fixated on who the presidential candidates for the Green Party are. Got that one out of the way. Right now it’s like a running commentary in my head about the biblical plagues of Egypt. “ So the first one was water to blood. Hey remember that scene from the Mummy at the bar? Oh and frogs. We love frogs. I wonder how big that one frog was. Beezel Buffo I think the name was. That big honking one. Think it ate tigers? Did you know tigers have striped skin? You don’t have any dresses that are striped.” I just want my brain to shut up. And now I have to go look up the stats on that freaking frog before I can sleep. Yay, more useless trivia learned at 3am.
Signal	I have been on 5mg of Lexapro for some time due to anxiety (it has actually helped despite the very low dose), and my insomnia has been bonkers lately so I went to my psychiatrist and he put me on 50mg of Trazodone. I happen to also be a medical marijuana patient due to crazy pain from IBS and the insomnia as well. While the weed helps me get to sleep it doesn't help me stay asleep. Now, I am reading about serotonin syndrome-- I am relatively certain (using my psych major degree to use) that marijuana doesn't act on serotonin the way SARI's and SSRIs do. Has anyone taken such low doses of Lex and Traz together? What was your experience? (if you happen to also use medical marijuana alongside these I would be curious if you had any issues and your experiences.)
Signal	in my entire life till now, i never had problems with sleep. since april 2020 i have sleep problems, they come and go. i suffer from depression but i got no idea if corona or the depression causes this. the moment i went to my brothers garden ( corona fear was there) it all started. it’s been really hard months and sometimes i wish to die. the last 2 nights i could not sleep till 2 am! then i woke up by 6 and worst thing is i don’t even feel tired or sleepy! it’s completely gone since april.. i got a full ct check and blood test and nothing is wrong with my body, so it’s my psych. i don’t know what to do anymore, i just want my old life back. ;( i got put on seroquel but seriously i dont wanna gain weight, already gained 5 pounds from it. mu last resort is cbd oil ..
NotSignal	No matter what I do I always seem to feel too hot or too cold (usually more so feeling to hot). Even with the max setting on a fan and no covers or anything I’ll feel too hot. Is it just me?
Signal	I have been doing sleep restriction with a sleep doctor for over 2 weeks now, and so far I have not seen any improvement. I sleep from 1:30-8am. I have actually saw improvement last week, but it just vanished and now I’m back to square one. I’ve been averagely getting about 2-3 hours of sleep this whole week. I can’t sleep because of my anxiety that randomly creeps up on me as soon as I get to bed. I am extremely tired the whole day, today it’s to the point where I think I’m gonna pass out because of how sleepy I am. I need hope. I don’t have any hope right now. Everytime I get hope it goes away the next day. All I’ve been seeing so far is my anxiety is going through the roof because of my sleep deprivation.
Signal	fucking vampire weekends diplomat's son is stuck on my head on repeat. i tried listening to the ending so it would shut the fuck up but it hasnt worked.

I HATE MY LIFE
Signal	Does anyone else get a weird fear of sleeping as they are starting to nod off ? I've been really struggling with this. Can't get more than a few hrs of sleep a night. Just switched from mirtazapine to Clonidine. I wish I never got on these drugs.....
Signal	Hello 👋🏼 So, my gf has anxiety induced insomnia (or maybe it’s the other way around) and I’m looking for ways to help her slow down and feel better. She’s had this issue ever since we met and i feel like it’s gotten much worse as we’ve been quarantined together. We usually stay awake until about 10pm-midnight and then start to wind down and get ready for bed. But, where I go to sleep at about midnight, she’ll stay up until about 6am and the fall asleep only getting a few solid hours of rest. I try to talk to her about what she’s feeling but she says it makes it worse sometimes because she feels like nobody understands what’s going on in her head. She says she can’t stop thinking about the unknown. Things that might or might not even happen and keeps her up all night long. She just stays up watching movies bedside because she can’t even lay down, she says it’s too much for her. Sort of an overload of anxiety I’m guessing. If anyone here can help please message me or leave a comment. It’d be much appreciated. 🙂
NotSignal	I recently went into anaphylaxis which means I'm om high level steroids. These things are known to keep me awake, but they also keep my throat open.So, here I am an insomniac on steroids awake and wanting to sleep
NotSignal	Has anyone tried cbd supplements or weed for insomnia and did it help anything? I’ve had insomnia for most my life, and just recently got a job and don’t think I’ll be able to hold up any longer running off less than 5 hours of sleep.
Signal	My insomnia has gotten out of control over the last two years and I have tried every sleep hygiene technique, breathing technique, and many over the counter drugs and prescriptions.2 days ago I purchased some "CBD sleep remedy" and I am so happy to report that I got over 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep the last two nights in a row. I've also been doing light exercise during the second half of the day to reduce cortisol.During the last few weeks I have regularly gone for 2 and 3 days without sleeping a single hour and feeling completely cracked out all day. Literally it feels like coming down from hard drugs, all the time. I've been on the edge of insanity.If you haven't tried it yet, please give CBD a chance.
NotSignal	If you're the kind of person who is helped to sleep by having something playing in the background, search Drive In Movie Ads on Amazon Prime. 75 minutes of weird, nostalgic concession ads and other stuff that used to play at drive in theaters. Worked well for me.
Signal	I've been unemployed for a year from a long mental health story, but I'm doing better now. However with the unemployment, my terrible staying up late habits have gotten even worse.Im currently falling asleep at around 6/7am and going to bed about an hour before that, and I'm waking up around 12/2 pm.This is obviously very unhealthy, but I have difficulties with self control so staying away from my computer or nicotine before I go to sleep is hard, I know that I shouldn't be doing these before sleep. Sometimes I have good days sometimes I have bad, however I'd ask when it's this fucked up where do I start?Do I force myself to wake up early regardless of how tired I am? Or do I stay up for 24 hours and try to fall asleep at a more normal time? Any advice would be appreciated, and sorry if this is incoherent, like most people I'd imagine I'm laying in bed tired but I can't sleep.
Signal	62hours and counting... anyone health experts/enthusiast out there with ANY input? Sleep deprivation is said to have a HUGE impact on your body. I do this often, even though I ALWAYS feel tired. But I’m sure that’s due to not sleeping then oversleeping.I should admit that Drugs and alcohol are a factor, however the extreme different between how I feel at night vs in the day are generally still consistent with or without.I finally gave into believing it MUST be my “body sleep cycle” I’m 25, my bedroom has always been where I spent most of my time Etc-Any advice on fixing the Internal clock inside of the existing upside down 🙃🙂 Please and thank you ! :)
Signal	For 5 nights in a row I couldnt sleep for more than 3-4 hours, and with a job far away from home its so hard to keep my sanity, ive gone into constant depression due to lack of sleep and cant even focus, see or think normally, idk what I can even do about it anymore, that is so fked up, Ive never had it so hard in the past and Ive been insomniac since birth.
Signal	I just got prescribed a new pill called belsomra and my doctor said it was strong. Nothing helps me sleep, has anybody had any experiences with this medicine good or bad? I would really appreciate it! I think I’m starting off on 10 mg
Signal	Didn’t want to discuss this with anybody but recently this has been taking a toll on me so I have decided to ask Dr. Reddit.Just as I fall asleep, during “hypnagogia“ (I think) I am constantly becoming aware that I am starting to dream. I will be awake, I will drift off to sleep, I will start dreaming, then I will notice I’m dreaming and will wake up again. This cycle keeps repeating for me. Each night it has become progressively longer, and my anxiety surrounding it has increased. Any help would be appreciated.I have not used reddit before, actually just joined to get assistance on this issue I’m experiencing
NotSignal	Hey everyone! I’m a 22 y/o female college student and for the past year, I’ve had chronic insomnia. It’s ruining my life and the youthful years of my life. I’m intrigued to see if there’s any other college students around my age who are also experiencing the same thing? I feel pretty lonely as all my friends around my age sleep so well every night and no one can relate to my condition. I envy them and everyone around me. I need help on how to battle my insomnia and beat it all for one. I have always been an amazing sleeper! I would sleep for 9 hours straight and on top of it I could nap for an hour or two per day. I’m so confused as to why this has happened to me and I can’t help but to think I’m cursed and the unluckiest person alive. I would do anything to have my good sleep days back. Please help!
Signal	So this past week I have been struggling with sleeping. I have just been prescribed citalopram because I am constantly anxious. Well the other night I didn’t sleep well now I spend all day thinking “am I going to sleep tonight am I going go sleep tonight?” It’s awful. my brain just won’t shut down. I keep thinking here we go again here we go again. When I can’t sleep after like 20 mins. I’m struggling. I have not tried melotonin or over the counter things. I’m afraid I will take them not sleep and be a zombie. One day I contemplated going to the ER
NotSignal	I fell asleep for 7 hours. I didn’t remember a single dream is this normal ?
NotSignal	4 nights I have been able to sleep for 4 hours 2 for 2 hours only the next one I slept 4 but today it’s another sleepless night, I hear the birds. Both sides of my brain hurts, Everytime I close my eyes I get this weird drowning feeling.
Signal	This happens sometimes with my limbs, right now it's my left arm, I don't know if my arm is asleep, but it doesn't tingle, I haven't slept on it, it just feels uncomfortable, I hit my arm and I feel pain, so its not numb, I just feel like swinging my arm around to get rid of it but it doesn't work, its driving me crazy and I can't fall asleep when this happens. Any idea what this is, I thought it was restless legs or arms syndrome but now I'm not sure
Signal	I've been on Trazadone for the better part of 10 years. I got on it for help to sleep but now I'm legitimately incapable of sleep without it. Once I wasn't able to get it and remained awake for over 72 hours (while actively trying to sleep) I should also note that the 72 hours didnt end with me naturally sleeping, it ended with me getting a dose. I've been weaning myself down for the past few months, and now can work off of just 25mg, but I want this leash out of my life. Starting today I'm finally gonna try to sleep naturally. I'd love to hear any of your advice or stories, I'm mostly worried about how long itll take me to be able to sleep for the first time.
Signal	Wide awake two hours after falling asleep. Took an Ambien at bedtime, then took lorazepam at 2. I can’t sleep because of stress and my anxiety disorder, but the doctor says sleep is the main ingredient for reducing anxiety. Hope everyone else is experiencing something better. This isn’t the way to start the New Year.
NotSignal	Started with watching anime late at night always saying that this would be the last episode but always gave in to the temptation to watch another video. Nowadays I can’t sleep at all even when I’m smoking joints it doesnt fucking do anything. I literally never feel tired... Im sick and tired of this I’ve tried everything and now I’m ready for medication. Please let me know what I could do. I was awake till 10am tried to sleep and now its 8:45pm and I’m still awake.
Signal	So this is the first time that I've ever been pharmaceutically medicated for my chronic insomnia since birth (I'm now 20). I'm taking a very, very low dose of Trazodone to help because it is non-addictive and I have severe anxiety about developing any addiction issues whatsoever. I'm taking half a pill of the lowest dose you can get prescribed, and I'm supposed to take it as necessary but I have taken it every night since it was prescribed because it was like heaven the first three nights not being able to fight back against the sleep. My body just MADE me sleep at a reasonable time. It felt incredible like nothing I had experienced before 😍 it is wearing off a little, so I'll probably take a whole pill (as my doc told me was okay to do if half wasn't enough) and will try to fall asleep on my own before taking it from now on.Has anyone ever taken Trazodone for sleep? Is there any tips or warnings y'all could give me? I know at high doses like 600mg it was used as an antidepressant back in the day but I'm on the lowest dose possible (I believe 5 to 10mg? I don't have the bottle with me rn just my little meds planner bc I also take gabapentin for fibromyalgia) so I was told that's no concern for me.
NotSignal	It’s already 4:30 and I need to be up at 7 with a full day of work ahead of me. I just finished training for this job but have to achieve the turn around of sales to meetings and I’ll also be alone at work with back to back meetings from 9-4. Tips to function on less sleep?
NotSignal	This is starting to wear me down mentally because it’s been like this for years, on top of the fact I’m dealing with a whole bunch of other issues including mental problems, drug use, and life issues. I just want a good nights sleep for fucks sake, so I can actually wake up and function like a normal human being.
NotSignal	How much sleep do you get on average every night? And are you a person that a) takes forever to fall asleep, b) falls asleep fast but can't stay asleep, and c) a person who can fall asleep just wakes up constantly. Currently have been battling not being able to fall asleep fast and it's torture.
Signal	Hi. I’ve been living with pretty bad sleeping issues for about a year and a half. I’ve recently started treatment for depression, which helped, but things have gotten worse again with my sleep during the lock down. Before antidepressant, I would sometimes be awake for 2 or 3 days on as little as 5-10 hours of sleep spread between them. I often fell asleep without difficulty, but would wake 2 or 3 hours later and would just lay awake until my alarm would go off for work. Then I’d have to work on the 2-3 hours I’d get, come home, fall asleep, stay asleep for 2-3 hours more and the cycle would repeat until it was middle of the week and the amount of hours I’d slept in 3 days was what a normal person does in one night.When I started getting help for depression, things got a bit better. I was given a 5mg dose of ambien to help me fall asleep if I was struggling. I didn’t take it every night since my primary issue was middle of the night waking, but it did help on the occasions where I couldn’t get tired. I would only take it when I really needed it, mostly because I know it can lose effectiveness if you take it nightly. For a few weeks, I was able to sleep 5-7 hours continuously, which is a big deal for me. But since the lock down has happened, insomnia is slowly creeping back into my life. Last night, I took the ambien at bedtime since I was not tired. I then laid awake for a full 8 hours (my body was nice and relaxed, but my brain was wired), until my alarm went off. I called off work (I can typically do my job/am used to doing it on very little sleep, but not none), took another ambien at about 7 AM because I was so desperate for sleep. I then slept poorly/on and off intermittent waking, for the next 5 hours. It seems to no longer be working effectively for me. Have considered taking 2, but am wary to do so without doctor signing off on it.The idea of doing 8+ hours of work on zero sleep is really stress inducing for me, too, because my job is not one where you can really afford to fuck up. Any ideas? Feedback from anyone is appreciated, although ideally would love feedback from adults 30 or over with 40+ hour a week/higher level jobs, as that’s the demographic I fall into.
NotSignal	So Over the last 3 months I have had really severe insomnia.. I notice that when I ‘wake up’ after about 3 hrs of sleep that night I try to go back to sleep but can’t. BUT my mind feels like it’s going crazy, the only way I can describe it is that I’m dreaming but I’m not because I’m awake/conscious????? Like I can picture things in my head like places and people? Is there hallucinating ????? Does this happen to anyone else I’m really scared.
Signal	I have been dealing with a bout of insomnia for about a month and a half (I've posted a lot here, so feel free to go through my other posts to get a better idea). Basically, I never had any trouble sleeping and then suddenly did. Went 3 days with no sleep with a week or so of bad sleep leading up to that. Then the next week I was fine, the week after that my sleep was broken up again. I started smoking weed to help and it did, for a while. Then this week I didn't sleep at all on Thursday night despite not having changed anything and I felt terrified that I had reached square one again. I have a neurologist appointment on Monday, and my primary care prescribed me Ambien on Friday for the weekend just so I wouldn't spiral. It worked pretty well, but it did take a while to work (I started with 5 mg and then took another when I wasn't asleep after 2 hours. I fell asleep shortly after the second dose. I also have a psychiatrist appointment on Wednesday. (I have history of anxiety but it has never caused this). The other thing is, I've been having neurological symptoms. Tremors, headaches, hallucinations when trying to fall asleep (this happened before any meds or weed so it's not caused by those), feeling a little dizzy/off kilter, slight double vision in both eyes and my eyeglass prescription changing after only a few months (the new script didn't fix the double vision). I was told I have dry eyes but the eye drops only help a little. My doctor is concerned I may have a pituitary tumor and/or seizures going on. Hopefully the neurologist will have an answer for me, because I'm terrified that the Ambien will stop working like the weed did and that I just won't have any solution, and that there will be no medical explanation for this either. I know SFI is extremely rare, but I'm still terrified because all of this just kinda came out of nowhere (the only symptom I can think of before the sleep was the double vision/vision change). I feel like I can't stop worrying no matter how rare it is. Sorry to be that annoying person, I'm just really frustrated and scared right now, because I was always good at sleeping but suddenly I'm not, and I have all these other symptoms.
NotSignal	Guess I’m not sleeping tonight. Of course I sleep perfectly well during my vacation days, but the night before I need to go back to work I can’t fucking fall asleep. Of course. Hope everyone has a good day tomorrow ❤️
Signal	For the past few nights, I've slept soundly. Like 8 hours not waking up a single time, I've only ever had insomnia when I was anxious (a few weeks back) which is when I wouldn't be able to sleep. When I wake up I don't feel tired at all, so I have to get out of bed and do other things for an extended period of time. The only culprit that I can think of was that I ate heavy before bed. Anyone else experiencing this?
NotSignal	Wondering if your insomnia has gotten better or completely dissapearred after minimizing or getting rid of anxiety
NotSignal	too tired to even type the whole thing fuck god fuck this cruel fucking world out
Signal	According to the Reddituser in r/AMA that has FFI, that sleeping pills would help him sleep but it would damage his brain fast. He also said that he can still sleep which is terrifying becoz i have insomnia and i thought having FFI means you cant sleep even with sleeping pills. 😥😥 please tell me im not the only one who’s scareddd. I wanna enjoy my life. Im still a fucking virgin. 😬😬😰
NotSignal	I honestly don't know what to think anymore. I've been having this weird insomnia where if I do manage to sleep i never feel any better or refreshed and would only sleep in short bursts. But Yesterday something happened which made me terrified about the possibility of SFI. I woke up maybe an hour or less into my sleep drenched and unrest ed. TMI warning: I usually masturbate before bed to help me relax or release some tension to help with sleep. I have never had any diffculty getting an erection to this point. But yesterday when i woke up extremely anxious and decided to relieve my self but I couldn't get an even a sign of an erection at all. Which came really out of nowhere and suddenly as earlier in the day i relieved myself. But this sudden impotence has me scared that it might be something serious. I dread the thought of it being connected to SFI but i don't really have much explanation. I have been having an abnormally high blood pressure and heart rate too which further makes me scared for SFI. I know the chances are pretty much impossible but I have no real explanation. Please if anyone can give some insight into this.
Signal	i’m not sure if I actually slept last night and i don’t know if I will tonight. I’m a bit anxious about it and idk what to tell my boss if I should just stay home and try to sleep? (Last minute like that).
Signal	I've had sleep issues for almost 3 years now, after some traumatic events happened in my life. But even before that I had always spent the night in the computer as a teenager. I used to sleep between 4am-6am and wake up at 12pm-2pm. Os course that fucked up my system and I can only sleep "naturally" at that time now.This sleep schedule had unpleasant side effects in my adult life and now I'm trying to sleep like a normal human being would, but I'm facing some hard time falling asleep early. I toss and turn and maybe drift off a little but I start to get anxious and start to feel very unconfortable in bed. I had to get up and do something and then try again, but it was already too late. My last two nights were like this and I slept maybe 4 hours each, tonight I think I'm getting no sleep at all.I've been trying to wake up always at the same time but I've been sleeping through the alarms due to being exhausted from little sleep.My question is, should I not go to bed until I feel extremely sleepy? And still try to wake up always at the same time? I feel like I'm going to die if I do that because I'll probably get 2 hours of sleep each night.Anyway, I need to go back to a regular sleep schedule because all these sleep problems are causing trouble in my life and making me very depressed.Thanks and sorry for bad english, not my first language and ofc I'm sleep deprived :)
NotSignal	My dreams use to be my getaway. Now I'm stuck with the dragging feeling in my calves that keep pulling me straight down. I'm suffocating.
Signal	I recently got prescribed 25mg of Trazadone after being diagnosed with an insomnia disorder. I’ve been on the meds for about two weeks now and this morning I woke up feeling hungover, but I haven’t been drinking at all. So I’m very confused as to if this is a normal side effect or not. For extra info I’m a 20F. I had a sleep study and MSLT done to see if it was narcolepsy and thank god it wasn’t, but it was a form of insomnia. Thanks!
NotSignal	I cannot sleep. I feel sleepy and I keep yawning but when i go to bed and try to fall asleep, hours pass and i find myself still awake. Random thoughts come racing in my mind when i try to sleep. There's no way I'm able to stop them thoughts. Any tips on how to stop them and fall asleep with a thoughtfree mind?
NotSignal	I keep waking myself up because as I’m drifting off, I think I have a sore throat. When I wake up, I feel fine. This has happened to me 3 times tonight.Anxiety and working in healthcare are a fun combo right now…
Signal	Hi all, I did a bit of an experiment on myself by taking meletonin and want to share the results. I have always hated Meletonin because it never made me drowsy nor helped with sleep, and everyone always told me to take it even though it didn't seem to do anything. But I was desperate for sleep, struggling with insomnia; I decided that I couldn't go through life making the choice of taking ambien every night or getting two hours of sleep. So, I decided I would take 5mg of melatonin every night at the same time to help reset my circadian rhythm; my theory being that screens and artificial light ruin my ability to produce the hormone. So I took it at the same time every night for four weeks, and I am very happy to say it has worked to some extent. The first two weeks I didn't notice anything. The third I noticed I would start to feel drowsy a bit after taking it. The fourth week I was actually able to fall asleep after taking it for three days of the week! I still woke up in the middle of the night, but that is the earliest I have been able to get to sleep in months. I intend to keep taking it, and hope it will continue to help. &#x200B;TLDR; even if meletonin doesn't make you drowsy at first, keep taking it and it may help eventually.
Signal	Does anyone suffer from constant insomnia every night ?!If So, how long has this lasted ??? It’s been the case for me for 4 months and I’m starting to think this is my life now.
Signal	^(i haven't slept for 2 days now and am starting to hallucinate slightly, i had just finished in the bathroom and i looked in the mirror and this giant teddy bear was sat on m y stair banister it looked at me with a grin and vanished)
NotSignal	I thought all these years laying down freaking out because I'm afraid of just randomly losing consciousness was just a crazy thought. Turns out it's real. Kinda relieving knowing that its a known thing.
Signal	So basically that. Because of severe chronic insomnia i wake up feeling drained and fatigued and sometimes just in a really bad/sad mood not feeling like talking to anyone. But especially at night it gets worse and I'm just on the verge of tears. And every night I worry about having to lay in bed soon and suffer another sleepless night again. I also have destroyed all my relationships with people mainly because of insomnia, because I couldn't even think and I just didn't know what to say. It's hard to talk to people when you feel tired all the time and can barely construct a conversation anymore. BUT i think this is because I already have a personality disorder that makes talking to people hard for me, but insomnia made it impossible for me. I've tried melatonin, sleeping pills, i've tried a lot, but nothing helps. Insomnia just makes my life 100x worse and more unbearable than it already is. The worst part is that it feels like I have no brain. I can't think. Like I'm a zombie. And also, how I get nothing done. I don't feel like doing ANYTHING because of my tiredness and fatigue. Not even the smallest things. I don't even do anything for school, i say i'll do it after 1 good night's sleep hopefully when i feel better, but that night never comes. I just don't do anything all day and just rot.
NotSignal	My neighbors downstairs are assholes and domestic violence and loud noise make it hard for me to sleep. I have a noise machine earplugs in a fan but when they literally are banging on doors or whatever it wakes me up. It's 3:41 a.m. and I'm awake from that. Is there a different type of noise machine or different mechanism I can use to prevent myself from waking up from the noise of them banging on doors/shaking.
Signal	I exercise too but still. I meditate. I still end up waking all drowsy and wobbly. It’s bad now because it’s been multiple days now of really bad sleep.
NotSignal	Most guides tell you to leave your bed 8f you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes. But they never say what you're supposed to do.I realize using my phone probably isn't one of them, but I don't want my body to associate reading or meditation with tiredness and sleep. So what am I supposed to do when I leave bed? (I went to the bathroom and drank some water so far)
Signal	I have a messed up sleep schedule , I often go to sleep near the time when I’m supposed to be waking up. But is it insomnia if It’s my own fault that I stay up at nights usually scrolling through my iPad or something , usually because I don’t want the morning to come ? (if I go to sleep it feels like I’m fast forwarding to morning if that makes sense? ). I have anxiety and depression and I’m just wondering about this because I don’t want to use the term insomnia incorrectly if all I have is a bad sleep schedule
Signal	I normally sleep 8 hours no problem, I’ve been fortunate to never have true sleep issues. Suddenly, around Christmas, I started waking up at 2am and have not been able to go back to sleep once I’m awake. Is this insomnia? Does it normally just start so abruptly? I’m averaging 4 hours a sleep a night and I’m beginning to fall apart with anxiety, headaches, irritability and just constantly feeling exhausted. I’m so scared that this is just going to be my life now and I’m terrified of how it’ll effect my job and being a mom. I’ve tried Benadryl, magnesium, melatonin, changing sides of the bed, sleep masks, white noise, sleeping in a separate room, Unisom, Zzzquil, Vistiril and Trazadone and nothing is keeping me asleep longer than 4 hours. I don’t even know what to try next or how to even talk to my doctor. I’m so lost.
Signal	So I wasn't sleeping super well, not that many hours, but I was not waking up in the middle of the night anymore. I had to go back to the office this morning, and I immediately went back to my old sleeping pattern. I was so stressed of not sleeping that I didn't sleep.. When I managed to fall asleep I immediately woke up in a panic (of not getting enough sleep). I'm not going to the office everyday as of now, but I will have to soon... not looking forward to it.
NotSignal	Any idea why this is happening to me? I cannot for the life of me do more than one cycle I always wake up during or just after rem sleep I believe. Sometimes it feels like I might be going straight to rem sleep then wake up after but I think this is when I’m really tired and may of read than you do enter rem quickly in such cases.Cheers
Signal	So I’ve had insomnia since I caught covid (3 months) and it is still ongoing. There has been many completely sleepless nights and I am also unable to sleep during the day whereas before I could sleep anywhere at anytime.. I am extremely tired throughout the day (eyes lit burning tiredness) yet can’t fall asleep and average about 4 hrs per night with meds. I wake up extremely tired and feel like I haven’t slept at all and the cycle repeats itself every damn day like ground hog day. And fyi it’s not the meds because even before I was on them I woke up feeling the same. Is anyone else the same? I genuinely think I have sfi and I can’t get a sleep study to show sleep waves and if I’m reaching deep sleep :(
NotSignal	i work overnights, and i like to write. but honestly right now i just want someone to talk to while i'm off. i have no friends. please?
Signal	I can’t sleep at night, I can’t sleep during the day and I can’t nap. Insomnia is crap. I find mine to be a complicated case. I’m 95% sure it’s anxiety related. Sometimes, It takes me hours to fall asleep, sometimes, I fall asleep within minutes. (Like last night when I got to bed exausted)Most of the time, I can’t maintain sleep. Whenever I fall asleep, I wake up within maximum an hour and half. When that happens it takes me forever to go back to sleep and then the cycle continues. I doubt it’s sleep apnea cause whenever I wake up, I don’t feel a shortness of breath. Im at a point where I know I need help but I don’t know who to contact? When this all started I pushed a bit my GP to prescribe me anti anxiety meds but he wouldn’t. My other option would be to find myself a therapist, but I have a feeling she/he’s gonna tell me to do things I already do like to try Meditation, breathing exercises, journaling and will obviously going to talk about ACT, which I already know about. I’m on the wait list for a anxiety support group but since my anxiety is mostly about sleep, I doubt this is going to help. I know it is not the case, but I feel like there’s no light at the end of the tunnel.
Signal	Hi all,This is a joyful post! I won't go through details of my history with insomnia but I will tell you I have been feeling much better with several different things. One redditor has recommended me a weighted blanket to calm me down and make me sleep better - as I am an anxious and overthinking person. I did not take his advice. This was 3-4 months ago. Yes. That is a long time. My insomnia was getting worse with university work. So, I said fu** it. I'm buying one. The results were instantaneous. I feel asleep in 1-2 hours rather than staying up all night. Remember, you might wake up several times a night. Keep going. You will thank me on this post. Just bloody DO IT!Things that me sleep better at night- Weighted Blanket (on Amazon)- L-Theanine (amino acid found in green tea leaves. Promotes deep relaxation. Also on Amazon).Best regards,Tar2ed
Signal	No matter how tired/sleepy i am at the end of the day I just can’t fall asleep. It’s like there’s a barrier that my brain has formed that keeps me from falling asleep. I try to relax before bedtime but no matter how relaxed I am, I still can never fall asleep. I tried the focusing on your breath thing and it worked 1 time out of 5. I think my problem is that i am too aware and trying to hard to fall asleep? How do I change that? Before I started to have insomnia, I used to lay in bed with my phone browsing social media and would start to feel sleepy and 99% of the time I would fall asleep without noticing it and now whenever I try to do the same I can be on my phone until morning... Sleepless nights are so frequent now it kinda became my new normali just can’t do this anymore, I feel like i’m dead. I wish I didn’t have to witness so many daylight/nighttime cycles Has anybody been in the same situation and if so what did you do?
Signal	I've had 6 hours of sleep in the last 96 hours. I called in to work because I felt so terrible. I'm on Seroquel and have been taking other sleep remedies, but they don't help.How do you guys deal with the zombie feeling after being sleep deprived for so long?How do you explain to others what it's like?
NotSignal	Gotta love insomnia! It’s so annoying and feel like brain is just racing Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler
Signal	I fell asleep around 12 after being tipsy, and woke up two hours later and I can't seem to fall back asleep and my anxiety is starting to get to me because I can't feel the sleepiness. I had coffee around 5-7pm and alcohol later on, do you think this may be giving me some insomnia or is it more anxiety at this point?
Signal	hello! i’m 19F here, it’s currently 6am, and i’m very scared right now. since the recent pandemic, my sleeping schedule has been completely out of wack and my insomnia from my early high school years has come back. it’s left me terribly anxious and i’m just looking for some reassurance, or advice, or some cold hard facts. anything, really. lately my insomnia makes me go from pulling multiple all nighters, to sleeping 15 hours, to sleeping only 2 or 5 all in the same week! sometimes i nap during the day, sometimes i can’t. i can’t sleep without taking melatonin. i always try to get SOME sleep when i do all nighters but it’s usually on 1 or 2 hours. my “normal” sleeping schedule now when i can actually get to sleep and stay asleep is 8am to 2pm. i’m so scared of the affects this might be having on my body. do you think the affects are major? i don’t know what to do or how to get this under control. just scared.
Signal	[NEED ADVICE]Okay, I've been sleeping till. 3-5 AM (sometimes 6 AM) every night for 2 months now... And waking up around 1-2 PM. Gosh, how can I fix my sleeping schedule?My problems:• I tend to imagine and not sleep at all• tend to get anxious about my parents• my sister and I argue often• suicidal and depressed• overthinking• feeling like a burden• listening to music• using my phone
NotSignal	Hey everyone, I'll try to keep it as short as I can but I want to be specific enough so hopefully someone can assist me. Because of this, I'm using a throwaway account.**The Problem**For the passed 7-10 days, I've struggling to fall asleep. Some nights I don't sleep at all. The problem seems to be a few factors combined, but they're all related. Or at least I feel that they are:1. My mind sometimes seems to recognize when I'm drifting off to sleep, causing me to re-gain full consciousness. 2. My body is constantly getting little, random twitches, even now as I write this. It feels like a small group of muscles tightening up for a second or two and then releasing. No pain, just weird. These can occur anywhere on my body, head to toe. Even my face and neck, but most often in my calves and thighs. These sensations feel like they cause a sudden but slight surge of adrenaline. Like I've been static shocked. 3. Similar to a hypnic jerk, I will twitch massively just as I'm falling asleep. I don't get the sensation that I'm falling or anything like normal hypnic jerks I've infrequently experienced in the past.The random tiny muscle twitches are enough to keep me awake. Eventually I'm able to ignore them, but the larger twitches will strike as soon as I'm falling asleep, causing me to wake up, roll over and try again. Rinse and Repeat.**General Health Info**I'm a 28 year old male in good shape. 5' 10" 160lbs. I work a desk job in IT, so I've always made sure to stay physically active. I run 1 to 2 miles each weekday (on top of a workout). Because gyms are closed I just go for a run now. Before this whole COVID situation, I worked from home two days a week. I'm working from home full time now, but other than that my routine really hasn't changed too much. I get up at 730 every day, my shift starts at 8. I eat the same things for breakfast every day. Yogurt or Cereal (Cracklin Oat Bran, Frosted Mini-Wheats). I take a multivitamin, flaxseed oil, and my Claritin-D (allergy season) with breakfast. Lunch at 1130 is usually a tuna fish sandwich, or turkey burger. After my run in the afternoon I'll sometimes drink a protein shake (Muscle Milk Pro Series), but not all the time. For dinner (630 PM) I usually have grilled chicken with steamed vegetables and a carb side like rice or Kraft mac n cheese if I want something really tasty. I always make sure to stay hydrated throughout the day, drinking probably a gallon of water a day. Sometimes I would drink too much water before bed and find that it would cause me to sweat profusely while sleeping. Bed time is at 10. I make sure to get off the computer around 9-930 to settle down for bed. I limit myself to one cup of coffee per day, always in the morning. I almost never drink caffeine in the afternoon. I also do not consume alcohol during the week, only Fridays and Saturdays, and even then I will have a few. I won't get blackout wasted or anything. **My Bed**My mattress is only a few months old and I love it. Same with my pillows as I recently moved into a new place. I'm comfortable here now. I don't feel like I'm sleeping in a foreign place. I run an air purifier at night to help with my allergies and because I like the white noise that drowns out any noises from neighbors or outside. **More details and possible causes(?)**Recently I've had many sleepless nights because of this. Ironically, by the time I'm supposed to be getting up for work, I'm so exhausted that I can pass out and finally get some sleep. This has caused me to stay at work later to make up for my later start on the work day. I see a pattern forming and I don't like it. I want to resume my normal, healthy life again. I've done a fair amount of research and I'm able to confidently say that these aren't muscle spasms. There is no pain or cramping. Nor is it from stress (nothing stressful going on in my life right now, except for not sleeping), nor Restless Leg Syndrome. The only thing I can think of is that it's some vitamin deficiency, like **low potassium**, that could be causing this. Two or three weeks ago I believe I had **food poisioning** from some bad takeout. What followed was 2-3 days of recovery filled with bouts of diarrhea, nausea, cramps, hot flashes, maybe even a fever. etc. Afterwards, I ate cleanly, and avoided alcohol the following weekend to give my body the time it needed to recover completely. I had no problems sleeping afterwards, but I'm wondering if it may have played a factor. **Things I've tried*** ZzzQuil Pure Zzzs De-Stress Sleep Gummies - These seemed to just make me more tired. I'm already exhausted, I just need to fall asleep.* ZzzQuil (alcohol free) Syrup - Didn't work and sometimes had the opposite effect.* Magnesium Supplement, which I would take with dinner. - No discernible effect.* Today I went out and picked up Orange Juice to have with breakfast and Sweet Potatoes to have with dinner this week. I figure if the cause is low potassium, this could help as I don't seem to be getting nearly enough of it in my diet anyways. Can't hurt.I dread going to sleep now. I'm so tired, when I get into bed I exhale ("ahhhhhh") but I'm starting to psyche myself out about how I'm in for another 8+ hours of rolling around and being teased of almost falling asleep. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Should I contact a doctor? Any suggestions? I'm really at a loss here and I'm desperate at this point. Sorry for the long post, it's longer than I had intended, but I think the amount of detail may help. Thanks in advance!
NotSignal	Anyone want to talk? I can’t sleep anyways and it’s 4am so might as well.
Signal	Had bad quality sleep last night due to a “restless back” feeling? Would wake up every hour because I’d experience a creeping feeling on my spine. I’ve experienced this before but only for a short time and never really throughout the night. Along with this, I felt like peeing every 5 minutes. Really wasn’t able to sleep properly.Didn’t do anything out of the ordinary throughout the day. Just had my regular coffee, 25-min run and 10-min core workout in the morning. Spent the day at home since I’m still in isolation. Fell asleep for a nap at around 8PM but only for 30 minutes. Took melatonin at 10:30PM like I usually do. Proceeded to keep urinating every couple of minutes and experience a creeping feeling on my spine every time I’d fall asleep. Help please!!
Signal	Last night was horrific. I went to bed at about 10pm and I’m gonna be honest I forgot how to fall asleep... after about 2 hours had passed I began to get anxious because I had to be up at 6 and this is when problems occur as I got more anxious the more giddy I got. After this, I just gave up and decided to stay up and I got through the day ok to be fair but it’s beginning to catch up. I just know that tonight when I’m trying to sleep I will start getting anxious again... Any tips on how to relax and avoid this anxiety? (I’ve tried meditation,deep breathing and podcasts but they didn’t help)Thanks
Signal	I really think it's time government remove the "recommended" 7 to 8 hours a night nonsense. Not only is it not true (everyone has their own unique required amount based on genetics) but it also creates anxiety that worsens insomnia and , as in my case, encourages people down the slippery and destructive path of medication. If it weren't for reading articles based on government advice when I was younger I would never have developed anxiety about my 5 to 6 hours natural sleep time and would never have began using benzos which left me a nervous sleepless wreck lucky to get 3 hours a night.
NotSignal	Listening to guided meditations seemed silly to me at first, but they have been a huge help to get me calm enough to sleep. They help me drown out any outside sounds that I usually would focus on unintentionally. I use earbuds to really block out everything. They’re easy to find on YouTube and there is quite a good bit of variety for different types of listeners. Hopefully this helps anyone who is up for trying it.
Signal	Let me start this off by saying this week as been utter hell as far as sleeping patterns go. Cumulatively, this week, I’d say I’ve probably slept a total of maybe 15 hours this week. I haven’t slept at all tonight/today.. let me also say i am diagnosed with a depression and anxiety disorder, which I take 10mg lexapro for, and I’ve been extremely stressed over some personal issues I’d rather not get into. When my head hits that pillow, it seems that I can’t relax, and I find myself thinking about my problems more so than before. Man I just wanna fuckin sleep.
Signal	I know many already say this but to me really 2020 was about to have a new start in life ,i had some bad anxiety and insomnia attacks end of 2019 (3 days no sleep) sometimes after some misfortunes and mid life crises, the doc prescribed me ambien and klonopin and planned to put me on antidepressants early March but with some will power i improved my condition. I planned to make 2020 a better time and then this virus chaos happened and i can't do any of the things that helped me cope. Should i just give up and go on meds i worry about nights i can't sleep i need to be there for my eldery parents at this crazy moments and my nephew who is the main source of my power, i worry being on antidepressants will change me as a person :( and we don't know how much longer this corona situation will last.
Signal	I think it started from a combination of abusing adderall almost daily for the past 5 years, severe anxiety, and super high stress levels from being in a really tough 6yr college program. Which im not even done with yet and will probably have to take a year off at this point. But the insomnia started going downhill hard around july 2019 when i started having panic attacks. I would be up for usually 2 days at a time. I decided it was time to give the adderall a break and i was prescribed gabapentin (for anxiety and nerve pain that came from the addy abuse) and ambien. I thought a break would help but i was clean from stimulants for 3 months and the insomnia only got worse. Within a few months i went from having to take 400mg gabapentin and ambien 12.5 to sleep to quickly having to take 3000-4000mg gabapentin plus 25mg+ambien, 200mg+ trazodone, and 100mg doxylamine to knock me out. I could only do this once every 3-4 days otherwise would run out of meds within a week n a half and they wouldnt be working after a few days anyways cause of tolerance. Booze only made the insomnia even worse so i didnt fuck with that. Eventually this whole cocktail hardly worked anymore and i would never fall asleep sleep on any night that i didnt take those huge od’s of all them together. by then it was the middle of march and i was starting to fail school due to being up for days in a row on the regular so i ordered strong research chem benzos for a quick fix to finish off the school year. Worked well for about a week, went into severe withdrawal after only 4 days when i tried to skip a night for a tolerance break. Had seizures trying to withdraw myself after the school year ended and was on large doses by then. Got detoxed at a rehab, have been off the benzos for 9 days now and have only slept once since then. Im fucked and it feels like im gonna die. Ive been on gabapentin, trazodone, topamax, lamictal, paxil, zoloft, mirtazapine, ambien, lunesta, clonazolam, diclazepam, doxylamine, melatonin, cbd, doxepin, cyclobenzaprine, phenergan, all at some point in the past year to try and help the insomnia and am just completely fucked now. Feels like im gonna end up killing myself or drop dead of a heart attack. I cant do anything, cant function or go places, cant even smoke a cig anymore without blood pressure skyrocketing and having a panic attack. My psychiatrist wont let me try seroquel or zyprexa because those are “too heavy” and says he doesnt prescribe those even tho hes aware of my situation. I stayed up for the entire 7 days straight that i was in rehab and they wouldnt let me take anything other than a melatonin and straight up did not believe me about being awake for that long even though all i did was lay in bed crying all day every day, not able to walk, and was hallucinating. Has anyone else here been in a situation like this? It feels like recovering isnt possible anymore
NotSignal	I do not know if it's because of my breathing, when I stop breathing for like a couple second it makes me feel uncomfortable, it's making it hard for me to sleep tonight. Last night I was able to sleep easily but tonight it's hard since this sensation is bothering me.
Signal	No sleep is an exaggeration, I’ve gotten about 1-2 hours the past few nights. Tonight though, I think I’m just too excited to sleep. I drive to LA in about an hour for a famous birthdays interview, a meeting with Tik Tok, and 2 collaboration videos. To say the least it’s going to be a busy day. I’m a little worried about driving but I think if I drink a 5 hour energy before the drive and a monster when I get to the city I should be okay. Not too sure why I can’t sleep. The past 3-4 months have been like this. Going a few days without sleep and then trying to fix my schedule by downing NyQuil
Signal	I know this sounds ridiculous, so believe me or don’t I won’t lose any sleep over it. (Literally)Ever since I can remember I’ve never felt sleepy. Yes I’ve been physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted, but still not sleepy. Some of my earliest memories are of me in bed wide awake waiting for the sun to come up, watching it rise, and rushing downstairs to tell my parents it was “awake time”. Throughout the years my family put it off, I was just an energetic kid, I’ll grow out of it. Well here I am, 23 years old, and still the only time I sleep is when my body shuts down after a few days of being on. If I try to lay down and relax my brain starts to wig out and my muscles all start to contract really fast. I can still move and get out of bed so I don’t think it could be called a seizure, more like restless leg syndrome but ALL OVER MY BODY. I’m in a constant state of mental fatigue, my social life is suffering drastically, my grades and work performance are dropping. I don’t know what to do at this point, I’m not happy anymore and it’s terrifying... I’ve tried every OTC sleep aid available to me, gone to the doctor for prescription sleep aids and still nothing. At first I’ll admit, nights one and two go great. But then after that it’s like my brain figures out I’m trying to take something to help me sleep and decides to power through. I’ll close my eyes, feel myself succumb to the drug and then just before I fall into dreamland, BOOM! I’m jolted awake like a goddamn car on jumper cables. My bed is comfortable, my room is cool and dark, I have a fan, I do deep breathing exercises, I meditate daily, I exercise 5x a week, I go to counseling weekly, but I can’t take these ridiculous “solutions” to this very real problem anymore. I’m not some idiot who stayed up all night once and thinks he’ll never sleep again, I’ve been tormented by a lack of sleepiness my entire life and I’m close to giving in. I’m not sure if those around me don’t take me seriously or just can’t relate, but whatever the case I’ve decided to reach out on Reddit because I don’t know how much more I can take of this.
Signal	I’ve had sleep issues on and off my entire 20s, but in the past it’s been cantered around not being able to fall asleep. Now I’m waking up naturally anywhere from 3-5am, and not being able to get back to sleep. My body seems ready to go for the day? but I’m obviously (very tired). I usually sleep around 11-11:30pm.Currently, I’ve been up now since 4am. Very mentally tired but can’t sleep. This has been going on for months. Any remedies that have worked for people dealing with this form of insomnia?
Signal	It’s been one week where Ive slept from 2-4 hours a night and I don’t know how to contain myself emotionally, I feel like I’m on the cusp of losing it. I use to sleep so easily and now even with taking Nyquil last night I woke up within 2 hours. I’m scared shitless and have tried different methods to sleep but I’m not sure i’ll ever sleep like i did before and Im scared of getting on sleep meds just to get one good night of sleep. Not sure if I’m anxious from not being able to sleep or it’s just me. Sorry for the rant, I know people haven’t slept normally for years, not sure how any of you manage, but if you have any tips please let me know.
NotSignal	New thing, in addition to not being able to sleep most of the time, when I do sleep I can't wake up. Not even to four alarms on two separate devices(one clock one phone). This is actually just gonna continue ruining my life. Fortunately got a doctor visit in a couple weeks... Now to find a random short term job till I can find something interesting. Oi.
Signal	My issue for the past few weeks has been frequent waking up (like every 2h or so), every time after a vivid dream. If I sleep for 6h I'll remember 3 distinct dreams. It seems like I'm never able to fully drift into deep sleep, permanently stuck in that light, dream sleep. After sleeping 6-8h that way I don't feel refreshed, I still feel very tired, strengthening my suspicion of there not being much, if any deep sleep. This scares me a lot as I've read it's typical for SFI. Any ideas what else it could be? I can't really visit a doctor due to the whole COVID situation.
NotSignal	All the cases I have seen of people recovering are those whose insomnia meant sleeping between 4-5 hours every night. In my case I can barely sleep for an hour before waking up with my heart beating fast and my body in fight or flight mode. Psychiatrist thinks my anxiety is to blame and wants to put me on antidepressants but even then there's no guarantee I'll get my sleep back. Neurologist thinks my brain will fix itself and that I shouldn't take any pills. I'm at my wits end. Even with meditation I don't seem to be able to fall asleep faster or stay asleep. I don't even feel sleepy in the afternoons like I used to or able to take a nap.
Signal	I'm so god damn tired why cant I sleep I need to wake up in a few hours and I feel like I could run a marathon why cant I fucking sleep, I had 3 nights of 7 hours but now its fucking late and I'm wide awake
Signal	fucking vampire weekends diplomat's son is stuck on my head on repeat. i tried listening to the ending so it would shut the fuck up but it hasnt worked. Ive been fighting sleep for like two weeks and just barely managing to get sleep. I keep falling asleep at 4 am. I have work in 4 hours. please help me. I hit my head with my hands and literally yelled at myself to shut the fuck up IT WILL NOT STOP. I HATE MY LIFE
NotSignal	So I bought a Fitbit a few weeks ago. For me it really helps to see the break down of sleep I am getting. Fortunately I am out of the stupid waking up every hour on the hour crap that I had for over 4 years and now usually get a good block of around 4 hours before I start waking up every 30-60 mins. Does anyone else use a Fitbit to track sleep.
NotSignal	For those who've tried it for sleep. How long did it take to kick in? (If at all)What side effects did you experience?What dosage did you take?Thanks
NotSignal	Hey guys for some context, even before the pandemic my sleep cycle has been..less than great. I work in the music industry so I would go to bed fairly late and wake up anytime from 12-2pm. But of course things have been even stranger during the pandemic...for obvious reasons.Anyway for most of the pandemic I have been going to bed around 5-7am and getting up anything from 2-4pm. Not great. But for the past week and a half or so I can't seem to sleep consistently through the night and suddenly have been waking up around 5-6 am every day without fail, no matter what time I go to bed.I have started to go to sleep earlier and earlier as a result of this but no matter what time I go to bed I seem to be waking up now every so often through the night and then can't go back to bed throughout the day and now I feel sluggish all day and am tempted to nap.I do drink a fair bit of caffeine, am obviously depressed/have anxiety with all that's going on (I am also stuck at home, as I live with at risk people). Is this a symptom of depression? I have always drank this much caffeine before and if anything used to sleep 8-9 hours, sometimes more every night regardless.I am sort of getting concerned. Thank you
Signal	Was prescribed low dose amitriptyline for sleep issues. However, the sedation lingers into the next day and it seems to impair my cognitive ability, which is not much better than just not being able to sleep.Does this lessen overtime? I dropped doxepin and mirtazapine because it left me completely out of it and it never got much better.
Signal	I try to go to sleep at 9 every night and I find myself laying thier wide awake. I end up going to bed at 5 then waking up at 9. When I wake up I’m so sleep deprived and so tired but I just can’t go to sleep. Does anyone know anything I need to try because I’m tired of not having any sleep ( no pun intended)
NotSignal	Back in the old days every tribe needed a night watch, right? And who better for that role than an insomniac. So after evolving for tens of thousands of years to fit the role our tribes needed, humanity had to go ahead and become civilized and render us useless. Sigh :(
Signal	Previously I was taking a few hundred mg of diphenhydramine every night but I realized I was having trouble discerning what events actually happened in my life, vs hallucinations and dreams/daydreams, always felt tired, irritable and my headaches were getting worse and I figured that was probably the cause. So I stopped taking it a few days ago and haven't slept since, my roommate stays up until like 2 in the morning with his light on and taking with friends which also doesnt help. But I think I'm feeling worse now that I haven't been sleeping at all and I'm really considering taking more diphenhydramine to knock me out but I just want to be able to sleep without having it come at the cost of my sanity.
Signal	Hi, I've been sleeping like shit for a week now. I started out of nowhere. I usually just lie in bed with my eyes closed, but last night was just terrible. Two nights ago, I had only two hours of sleep, so last night I thought I'll fall asleep in the blink of an eye, but oh boy, I was so wrong. I went to bed earlier than usual, at 11pm, but, again, I couldn't fall asleep. At first I was just annoyed. I hate closing my eyes and just waiting knowing I won't fall asleep before 6 or 7am. But after a while, my eyes started to hurt. And then came this terrible, terrible migraine. And then I started feeling very nauseous. My eyes started hurting even more and they got really swollen. I couldn't keep then open but when I closed them, I felt really upset and somewhat uncomfortable, because I knew sleep won't come. After a while it got worse, I wanted to throw up, but I barely ate anything all day, so my stomach was empty and nothing came out. At one point the pain was unbearable, I started crying and hyperventilating.I dont know what happened, but I do know me taking adhd meds (amphetamines) and drinking energy drinks, although in moderation, made everything worse. Yes, now I know how irresponsible this is. It was also my first day of antidepressants. I am very scared, very anxious. My body is so so tired, but I just can't fall asleep. I'm spending my days studying for my finals, I have one tomorrow at 9, and I'm so scared the same thing will happen tonight, I just don't know what to do. Does anyone know what happened? What should I do?
Signal	Hey all, I’m a 21 female and I have been dealing with insomnia for about 4 years now. Along with some other symptoms such as large oscillations in my blood pressure I started noticing diffuse hairloss all over scalp about 2 years ago. I doubt it’s genetic hairloss because it doesn’t seem to be forming any pattern typical to female pattern hairloss. I have started using minoxidil for about 2 weeks now. I use it twice a day. Have any other members had similar hairloss experiences?
NotSignal	TL;DR. I regularly sleep only 3-4 hours per night and have seen the following questions appear lot in some research. - Do I feel like I could go back to sleep after 3 hours from 'waking' (getting up for the day)? No- Do I NEED caffeine after waking to function? No, I drink coffee but I wouldn't say it picks me up and lets me function better. - Do I feel like I could fall asleep at the wheel when driving home from work? NoHold up. Just hold up. This may seem like a really stupid question. But hear me out. I have always been a terrible sleeper (6 hours and I'm high-fiving myself), these last three months have been particularly bad, but I'm actively doing more to understand and experiment with what I can do to try and improve this aspect of my life. I thought I would start with you all, my fellow sleep deprived Redditors.A bit about me - 27M. I exercise regularly. My diet from slob to fitness model out of 100 is about a 70. I drink 2 coffees a day and stop before 11am. No drugs or alcohol. Desk job. My typical sleeping night is in bed by 10pm, toss and turn til 11:30pm, 'sleep' til 3am, then toss and turn til 6am. I have been doing some research into insomnia and the three questions above keep coming up for "if you answer yes to these questions, you may have insomnia". These aren't from BuzzFeed - they're from articles written by MD's and sleep specialists. The thing that made me realise is (generally speaking) - I can function pretty well throughout the day. I often feel motivated to work out. I have reasonable energy to get my job/work done. When I compare myself to other people who sleep well and have a "rough night, I only got 6 hours" - these people ARE answering yes to those questions above. So what I'm wondering from you all is - how do you feel tired throughout the day? How do you feel with night after night of terrible sleep? Have you got used to this and now your body is able to operate at a reasonable level on less sleep (is this even scientifically valid)? Keen to hear your thoughts
NotSignal	Does anyone else find when they have a cold or a cough it makes what’s already so difficult even worse? 7:00am and not a wink, 5 would be kinda normal but these last two hours are killing me
Signal	So I've been without a job for 9 weeks really fun but I'm starting to get anxious and kind of bored stuck at home, all I do is browse the web with my cellphone Reddit YouTube some forums here and there so anyway I sleep around 4 - 6 am and I wake up at 12 pm everyday. And I'm just tired of it I tried asmr but for some reason it doesn't work anymore on me.Tried setting up an alarm an waking up at 9 am but still I only fell asleep at 3.30am.Any tips? I'm really tired of this days go by really quickly.
NotSignal	Do you read a book?Do you study?Do you do something productive?Or are you just on social media?
Signal	I haven't gotten good sleep for the past couple of days (but I have regular periods of insomnia anyways), and I think i'm beginning to feel the first effects. Previously, when I had bad nights of sleep, I still felt pretty energized when I "woke up." Now, I'm feeling some minor pain in my head. I'm kinda scared because I'm only 13. Other than my minor headache, I have no other effects, although I am feeling a bit tired. Any idea on what I should do to just get good sleep, and if my lack of sleep is causing this? Also, I'm spending a lot more time on technology (not before bed though). Could that be a cause?
NotSignal	i did everything. I opened some windows for fresh air, i went to the toilet, etc. Then when i fall asleep i wake up at 4am and i cant sleep since. Its 6 am now and i would like someone to shoot me so i would pass out.
Signal	As of late my jnsomnias improved to thei can get to sleep relatively easily but I wake up after 2 hours and its hard to get back to sleep after that I'm taking gabapentin and trazadone for sleepWould something like melatonim or valerian help me stay asleep a little longer? I haven't tried that stuff in a while because it never helped me get to sleep, but would it potentially help me sleep longer?
Signal	Ever since last August, I've been struggling with insomnia. More than half of the week, I get almost no sleep whatsoever. For about a few months since October, it was doing pretty well. I was still having sleepless nights, but only about twice a week. However, now suddenly, it's the worst it's ever been. I literally cannot sleep without taking Xanax despite my best efforts. The very thought of trying to sleep shoots my anxiety up to an extremely uncomfortable level that I cannot shake, even with guided meditation. I get so anxious that I have to breath manually. In addition to getting this anxious at night, I am ridiculously anxious for half the day (usually without even thinking about sleep). Up until recently marijuana has helped me a lot to ease my nerves, but like a switch, it suddenly turned on me and instead began to heighten it. I generally take Diphenhydramine and 5-HTP, as well as melatonin to sleep, but even with weed, Diphenhydramine, 5 HTP, and melatonin combined, I completely lack the ability to sleep. Not unless I'm taking a Xanax as well... I know the amount of medicines I take is bad for me, but I'm unable to sleep without them. I've been trying to reduce my intake of all of these, but there's been no results whatsoever in about a week.I've tried literally every sleeping pill under the sun with no results. Xanax is the only thing that helps me. I've also been trying guided meditation via the headspace app and I am still unable to get myself into a relaxed state. I've also tried exercising to ease my anxiety, but it didn't work. It's also extremely hard to keep a workout regimen when I am not sleeping at all every single night.I really need help. This issue is getting out of hand and is completely ruining my life. I can't go through the day without feeling like I wanna die because of how tired I am. And now coupled with this, I experience intense panic attacks at different intervals throughout the day. I feel like my brain is actively trying to torture me and I cannot do anything about it. I need help desperately. Do you guys have any advice on how I can fix this?
NotSignal	It's been happening to me for a couple months now - about every 3 weeks, I end up having an all-nighter to reset my internal clock. There's just no way I'm going to get to sleep on those nights, and I don't want to sleep in and make the problem worse. I'm trying to maintain good sleep hygiene, but self-isolating has made us change our daily routine and it is really throwing me off. I'm going to fight off my discouragement about my lack of productivity in the day ahead of me by listening to a Celine Dion album, making some bread, and watching a movie. Hopefully I'll get some chores done before my energy totally bottoms out (around 10am) and find some way to stay alive before I can go to bed in the early evening.
NotSignal	It's the absolute best for insomnia cuz you can stare at the ceiling for a couple hours and be entertained. You *might* even sleep for a little while
Signal	I have been in bed since 3 am and I haven’t been able to fall asleep. I have no fucking clue what to do and for some reason I feel really angry and like I want to cry.
Signal	Some background: 29yo, biologically Male. Short term insomnia due to intense anxiety and nightmares. Long term severe anxiety, depression, and recurrent (when memorable) nightmares. Hearing noises or smelling smells in the house that cause awakening in a panic. No trouble falling asleep, but tend to wake up every hour or so after the first 2-3 hrs of sleep.Supplements and medications tried:**Melatonin 5mg, 3mg, 1mg, .75XR** \- I've found Melatonin at any of these doses (though smallest, and XR recommended) will guarantee multiple awakenings and intensifying of nightmares. If I took melatonin every night, I could set my watch to the times I will wake up in the night.**Kava** \- I've dose escalated kava (for anxiety, mostly) to the point where I can take 2+ grams of 70% kavalactone extract and have no anxiolytic or other discernible effect. This strikes me as strange since it seems kava in most folks has a reverse-tolerance (the longer you use it, the more effect).**Magnolia Bark Extract 200/400mg** \- 200mg is a light dose for anxiety, 400mg works to get me to sleep. Enhances other methods that work on GABA receptor pathways. Similar Mechanism of Action to benzos, but with some affinity for Cannabinoid receptors too. For this reason, could be helpful anxiety/sleep aid for those quitting cannabis.**Mulungu Bark** \- No discernable effect**Buspar / Buspirone** \- Terrible for sleep. Could work for anxiety in those who have a more "ADHD - type anxiety" with multiple streams of rushing, panicky thoughts, you can't figure out which train of thoughts to follow. But also had the huge side effect of completely destabilizing my moods.**CBD** \- Enhances other methods, does make you sleepy at higher doses i.e. 100mg+**THC containing cannabis (Indica varieties)** \- I used to find these helpful, but can still promote severe anxiety. Studies also show reduction of sleep quality - less REM sleep.**Lemon Balm** \- also enhances other methods, especially those that work on GABA receptors. This herb may work for some on its own, in tincture form. 2-4 dropper fulls of it can be a powerful sedative/anxiolytic when first using. Mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is thought to modulate GABA in some capacity.**Lyrica 50-200mg** \- Enhances sleep and helps anxiety especially if used in combination (at low doses) with Magnolia Bark or prescription sleep aids. Scientific research finds that it promotes more slow-wave sleep (phases 3+4 (REM) ) within sleep architecture. Can be habit forming, so use sparingly.**Ativan 1mg** \- Can get me to sleep for 6hrs, but quality of sleep is reduced. Not a good long term solution either, due to habit forming nature. Use sparingly.**Ambien 2.5-10mg** \- Gets me to sleep, very quickly, but still have several awakenings in the night. Waking up with intense disorientation, headaches, and even some strange visual effects lingering. Feel extremely dumb and can't think of any of the words I'm looking for the day after taking it. Habit forming, so use sparingly.**Lunesta 2mg** \- This one works for me, especially alongside a 50-100mg Lyrica dose. Keeps me asleep for 6-7 hours continuously at a minimum with minimal next day effects. Habit forming, so use sparingly.Suggested Course of action for insomnia:**Twice-Weekly: 50-100mg Lyrica, 2mg Lunesta -** Take the Lyrica 3hrs before bed, Take the Lunesta up to 1h before bed.**Every Day besides the above (or as needed) - Lemon Balm Tincture (up to 4 dropper fulls), 400mg Magnolia Bark extract, 50-100mg CBD.** You can take these all at the same time, an hr before bed.
Signal	I wonder if it can be from stress? I've gone to bed at like 23.00 and it's now almost 1 am. I went to pee so many times I don't count anymore. I drink some more water every time cause I have such a dry mouth. Never had this problem before. I feel like my heart is beating kinda fast and I absolutely don't know how to fall asleep. I'm tired.
Signal	The night before I slept for two hours around 10pm, woke up, and then was wide awake all night until I wore myself out and passed out at around 5am. I was exhausted all day yesterday and ready to crash by 10pm. I got into bed at 11 and boom, my eyes snap open. All these thoughts and anxiety and tension rush in and to top it off, because of my lack of sleep the night before, my tennitis is screaming wayyyy louder than normal. Here it is, 3:30am, and any memory of any desire to sleep is gone. Everything in me is saying get up and start doing stuff! Like I had an espresso shot (I strictly do not consume any caffeine btw). It’s all anxiety. I can’t stop thinking about all the crap that as happened, is happening, and will happen. It makes me want to just get up and run away. And what I need the most to manage all of this crap, is sleep. But I can’t get it. The circle of anxiety.!Maybe this should’ve been in r/rant.On a more positive note, my little doggy is sleeping in his bed next to mine and he’s making really cute squeaks and tiny little grunts. If I were sleeping I’d miss out on this. Also I think a small animal is trying to dig it’s way through my roof into my attic.
Signal	HelloI want to sleep. I am tired, I took my sleep meds but my brain won’t turn off. I can’t fall asleep. My brain just continues thinking. I try to stop thinking but it doesn’t work. This now happened quite often lately. I don’t know what to do. (My medication is already almost at the safe limit)Shut up damn brain, shut up!!!
NotSignal	What are you doing rituals for a good long sleep? If you have any lmao.. I'm extremely tired at daytime and at night I just can't get my old sleeping quality it's frustrating as fuck
Signal	It got to a point where I'm already afraid to go to sleep. I sleep 7h per day, it's amazing, but I can only sleep after 4am. I've been sleeping so much because I always wake up at 12pm or something like that. Tonight I can't even go to sleep. I feel dizzy, my head hurts and I just feel afraid and in panic of not being able to sleep.
Signal	Hi guys! I’ve read through this subreddit a bit and I’m hoping you may be able to give me some suggestions. I think my boyfriend has insomnia. He usually sleeps for about an hour or two at night, and doesn’t fall asleep until about 7 or 8 in the morning. During the day he takes 1-2 naps as well, but says he doesn’t really sleep during the naps. At night he tosses and turns pretty violently and kicks around a lot. I also think he has anxiety and depression, which based off of reading this sub may contribute to this?He pretty much refuses to go to a doctor, but he has tried a few “home remedies” such as melatonin, smoking weed, CBD, and Benadryl. He says that none of them help. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Or should I just force him to go to the doctor? Will a doctor actually help? Thank you in advance!
Signal	I cant sleep like, sometimes it takes me about 5 to 6 hours to fall a sleep im done i dont know what to do.I tried like every possible breathing excercise it doesnt help. Im thinking about buying sleep pill or somethingI cant do this anymore i havent slept for 3 days straight This is f*ucked up im bored of this. Its 1:18 am i went to sleep at 10:30pm and im still not sleeping. This is really bad i have school in a week i need to fix this asap. Any help ? 🙄
NotSignal	If prescribed rameleton, would this medication work better if you took it every single day, or would it work better if you took it only on certain days (ie days where you have college or work the next day)Or put differently. Would this medication be more effective (each time you took it, obviously I don't expect it to have an impact on days where you didn't take it ) if you took it 7 days a week or only 2-4 times a week?
NotSignal	And I can't take it any more. At what point do I just go to the hospital and beg them to knock me out?
Signal	Hello, for the last three/four months I have been dealing with insomnia. It has gotten to the point were there are 2-4 days that I go with very limited sleep. I can remember the day that my sleep troubles started, and while nothing that significant or crazy happened that day, since then I have been in this horrible state. Not sleeping is affecting my health, work, relationships\`, day to day, pretty much everything. I am currently on 3 mg of Lunesta, but I know it is not a long term solution. Even on some nights, my brain is able to "fight off" the effects of the medication. I tried Ambien for two weeks and it was not very effective. At this point, I will be seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist in the next two weeks. I know that my anxiety over not sleeping/trying to fall asleep is not helping. That is compounded by the ways I deal with stress & feeling overwhelmed. I have also started feeling depressed about this situation as it bleeds to all aspects of my life. If you are in a similar situation or have been, what has worked for you? What techniques do you use to relax your body & mind? What goes through your mind as you try to fall asleep?
Signal	Okay, this is getting weird now. I believe I have been sleeping well. I fall asleep struggling a bit but I fall asleep. I’ll wake up maybe once a bit early. I get roughly 5-8 hours on a given night. However, I wake up and my eyes feel like they did not rest at all. On top of this, my memory is getting bad. I had people over today, and i said hi to my friend twice because i forgot I had already said hi to him! Could it be the quality of my sleep? I know for a fact I snore. Currently on medication too for anxiety and depression. I know if I were to go to my doc, he would say it’s probably just stress or something but I’m not so sure anymore.
NotSignal	How many days were you able to make with no hours of sleep what so ever? Just curious for some reason I cant sleep.
NotSignal	My girlfriend (who has chronic insomnia and needs at least 3 different medications to sleep) has fallen asleep before me and she isnt even on anything at the moment, is this progress??Im genuinely quite proud of her because usually she only sleeps 1 or 2 hours a night and now shes probably gonna sleep until like 8am so itll be approx 7½ hours of sleep on no meds, any idea how this fortunate incident has occured?
Signal	At most I’ve been getting 1-2 hours every night. It’s been especially bad this week and I don’t know why. I’m only 14 and it’s really unhealthy to stay up so late but I can’t control it.
NotSignal	I've had sleep phase disorder or insomnia (depending on my physician's assesments) for many years. I've always wnted to have an overnight test done--like brainwave and sleep-cycle tests to find out why I can't sleep for longer than 4 hours at a time.Is this something that an insurance company would cover? I haven't had a night of 8 straight hours of sleep in years, and I'd like to find out the reason. I can function on 4 hours, and sometimes get 6, but I'd like to know if there's something wrong with me compared to my friends who will sleep a full 8 hours, then nap for a couple of hours after lunch, but still feel fully energized on work days.
NotSignal	I’m talking to someone new for over a month now. I really like talking to him because we get a long so well and reminds me a lot of myself too. I get excited when he txts me, and a little anxious that if I don’t respond quick enough he will think I’m not interested..and then not want to talk anymore. The problem is I notice my sleeping has gone out the window, and this has to be the reason because I will check my phone constantly throughout the day, and if I don’t respond quick to him, then I feel weird not opening his snaps and just leaving it there..even though it’s probably better to not respond so quick all the time anyway because then the conversation will run dry. I think if me and him hang already I will feel more comfortable knowing how our friendship really is and how real it is, but right now I just can’t stop expecting and wanting to talk to him everyday of every minute and it’s ruining me. I got maybe 4 hours of sleep past 3 days, it’s like when I try to sleep..my body and brain just want to constantly check my phone, like I do throughout the day. It’s like a drug for sure. How do I get better, how do I start sleeping again? How do I remove any anxiety with this person? Another main thing is he is my best friends cousin, and an incident happened a few years ago that I blame myself for and assumed him and his family hated me so I believed he hated me for years..which im sure comes into play with this anxiety, and I’ve talked to him about it so he understands how I feel. Help? I’m starting to miss my peaceful sleep through the night and not like I’m on some sort of crack constantly fighting the urge to check my phone
NotSignal	Hi everyone, I was wondering if anybody has had experiences where you wake up and feel like you never fell asleep. For example last night I went to bed around 12:30am and woke up feeling like I hadn’t even fallen asleep. I remember the vague feeling of waking up, and I remember thinking to myself oh, it must be sometime around 1-2am I must have just been half asleep but when I checked my phone it said it was 5:30am. I then got this huge rush of anxiety because I wasn’t sure if I had slept or not. I don’t remember being awake and struggling to sleep, which on the nights I can’t fall asleep I always remember. The only things I remember are getting into bed around midnight and waking up around 5:30am . This really only seems to happen when I drink and smoke weed (not sure about the two individually but definitely in combination) which I did last night, but the unsure of whether I slept or not part is more of a recent development as I noticed it happening for the first time several months ago and actually stopped drinking and smoking for a few months because of it. I would like to add that the night before this I didn’t get much sleep since I was drinking all night with my friends and smoking weed, and slept from about 3-6:30am and then maybe a bit more from 7am-9am. The day before that I slept for 12 hours. I don’t normally have problems sleeping but I have a lot of anxiety about sleeping and sometimes I drink and smoke to calm down even though I know this has its consequences. I was wondering if any of you have experienced this feeling of not being sure whether you slept or not the night before, or waking up feeling like you didn’t really sleep. There are plenty of times i drink and smoke and do not experience this, but it has happened to me a few times and I’m wondering if anybody else has had this experience.
Signal	I've always struggled with sleep. I've often had bad nights, but I'd always sleep much better the next night and recover from it. It got worse, much worse in the past year. I don't think a bad night does much as long as you sleep well the next night. Welp, I just had my third 4 hour sleep in a row and I feel horrible. Last week I was sleeping 8 hours a night (I know, crazy!) and even though I'm doing the exact same things, I'm not sleeping until 4am at the earliest.
NotSignal	Don’t know if anyone can relate but I’m working 40 hours a week will attending school full time and man am I stressed. My insomnia was slowly coming back and now it’s pretty much full blown again. If this sounds like you, how do you cope?
NotSignal	What do you guys recommend for a 60x80 weighted blanket queen size the has good weight distribution?
Signal	So, I've never ever had any problems sleeping.Until one day- I just felt tired, went to bed at my normal time and laid down, instantly started to fall asleep. But for some reason, I felt a strange rush of anxiety and "electricity" in my chest, which waked me up all of the sudden. Now, because of my anxiety I started freaking out and thinking what the hell could this be. I have a really long anxiety attack, cry, get tired to the point of passing out and get some 3 hours of sleep in total.Now... it would've been ok if this was a one time thing. But it has been happening for the last two weeks.Usually I would be able to go back to sleep at the second try, but something happened that worried me.Same thing, I'm tired, go to sleep, a little anxious because of what's been happening, but still too tired to properly think about it.Just when I'm about to fall asleep... that weird thing happens again, but 20 times worse.The anxiety rush was so bad, I actually thought I was having a heart attack. Also, I kind of jumped a little on my bed, just like when you're dreaming of falling from a big height, you know? I also woke up scared, and very anxious as always. Didn't have a panic attack, just felt pain in my chest, nausea, wanted to go to pee real bad and my hands were trembling. This happened this night, I'm still awake, too scared to try sleep and end up having a heart attack (my chest still hurts and I have palpitations, this was four hours ago).So, is this just anxiety or should I worry about something else?I wanted to seek a doctor and get some medication, but I searched online and everywhere I looked said that if it's not urgent then I should book an appointment with the doctor. (Because of Corona)Problem is, I don't know if I can wait until an appointment, because this chest pain only gets worse.Though, I've always had chest pain... this one feels kind of different.Note: Since this started I said to myself I would not go to a doctor because this would probably get better, but the panic attacks I'm having because of this are starting to mess me up badly. Note 2: Never been on meds before.Note 3: Never been diagnosed with anxiety but I literally don't know what else to call this shit, mainly because everyone I know says it is anxiety.Sorry if it's too long, I just wanted some advice and to know if I'm freaking out without any motive (as always).Thanks for the patience, have a good day.
Signal	I have fatal insomnia. Lmao what else would cause sudden insomnia. I couldn’t sleep until 7 am a few days ago. everyone talks about falling asleep at 2 and 3 but for me it’s 4, 5 and said above 6 or 7. I’ve had intermittent mild insomnia in the past but this? Sudden and severe? What else would cause it?
NotSignal	Please help, I always wake up early despite what time do I sleep!! If i slept at 3AM i will still wake up at 8 AMIf i slept at 12 AM will wake up at 8 AMIS THIS NORMAL?!And how to sleep more, please help 😭
NotSignal	I have bipolar and aspd I usually pace all night or have to be active til like 6 am when I finally get to sleep I either don’t stay asleep long or sleep all day I can’t get any sleeping meds because it’s required for me to see my psychiatrist and now I can’t see her melatonin does nothing and diphenhydramine doesn’t help and reacts bad with my other meds does anyone recommend anything
NotSignal	Has anyone here had any success using an online CBT program specifically for insomnia?
Signal	I’m currently 16 years old. I’m pretty sure I have depression, anxiety, insomnia, and probably many more illnesses.My brain has always been my only good aaset, and I love thinking, but I also hate it at the same time. Up until I turned 9, and my life got ruined, I was tested for Aspergers and IQ etc. because I did so well in school without ever trying... I’ve never been good at sleeping, but it gets worse and worse every day, and I haven’t slept for 6 days now, mainly because my brain won’t shut off. I hate that I’m not able to think straight and learn anything anymore. I’ve already lived hundreds of years inside my head, and I never feel like I live in the real world; I’m just observing everyone else. My doctor prescribed me some sleeping pills a few days ago, but they don’t work on me, so I still haven’t slept. What am I supposed to do? I just want to be able to think again...
Signal	I’ve struggled with insomnia since I was 15, most likely do the the trauma I experienced before moving in with my dad at that age. I realized once I became an adult that staying up until 6am or just not sleeping at all wasn’t normal. I’ve been taking Seroquel for 3+ years now, originally it helped me get to sleep and deeply sleep, but I struggled to wake up if I wasn’t sleeping more than 12 hours. After adjusting the dosage several times, including to accommodate my pregnancy, and now being on 100 mg every night postpartum, I’m struggling to sleep again. There is a 50/50 chance I’ll take it at 8 pm and be drooling by 11pm, but flip a coin and I’ll take it at 8pm and lay in bed restless until 3am. When I do sleep, I sleep so long that it’s impossible to be awake before 8am, and even after a solid 8-10 hours of sleep I’m still exhausted. I’m just curious if any one else can shed some light on the why and if there is anything to help get a normal amount of sleep and feel well rested.
Signal	I have pretty bad insomnia. I can't sleep at all. It's been about 3 days since I've slept before 7 am. My doctor is seeing my at 11 am. I don't know what to do😞
NotSignal	Are they ok to take together like just the normal dose of each? I have barely been asleep for the last 3 days. Or is it too much to combine?
Signal	Hello, I am currently on my 50th hour without sleep and I am tired as hell but everytime I shut my eyes i get anxious that I won’t be able to sleep. In the past 24 hours I have been so irritable and on the edge that I’ve shouted at my mother needlessly and really upset when normally when I have had a healthy amount of sleep I would never do that. I am now really beginning to panic because I don’t know when I’ll next be able to fall asleep. I’ve had insomnia for a month now and on average in this month I’ve had 2.5 hours of sleep per night. This is really beginning to impact my mental health badly. Any advice on how to get to sleep and begin the road to beating my insomnia?
Signal	What is it like to be normal and just fall asleep? At times like this where its 4:45am, I get this overwhelming sadness about not being normal, and thinking about how this ruins my entire week. Every week. I’m 26 and just want to know what it’s like to fall asleep within minutes of laying down like so many can. I’ve never had that... and it’s just really saddening at this point.I take trazadone but I’m waiting for a refill and I wish I didn’t have to take drugs to fall asleep. Especially since it makes me feel like I got hit by a bus every morning.
Signal	So I have had insomnia (accompanied by diagnosed social anxiety disorder) since middle school but it’s gotten a lot worse since I started college and right now it’s at it’s worst. It seems to be a cycle. Basically I’m on my fourth “phase” of experiencing severe anxiety and insomnia. The first “phase” started September 2018 and it took maybe two months for me to get back into a normal sleeping pattern, then again in March 2019 after going through something traumatic. I got better over the summer after I was able to travel but insomnia hit really hard again when the new semester started in the fall. I became so depressed and I considered dropping out of school but one of my professors helped me get through it. After two months or so, I was in a good groove. Falling asleep anytime between 12 and 2 am, and waking up at 9 for school. I invested time into new hobbies and also got a job. I felt really good for the first time in a long time. I was also making a lot of process getting over my social anxiety. Now, I’ve been laid off and classes were moved online. A week or so ago, I couldn’t fall asleep until 10am due to anxiety and it’s been like this every night for a week. I’ve only been getting 3 hours max. It’s my fourth “phase” now and I’ve been crying 5 or 6 times every night because I’m so frustrated. Even though I am exhausted from getting little sleep the previous night, I can’t relax and calm down my mind. I feel like giving up because every time I think I’ve gotten better, something triggers my insomnia again. In the past, this did not cause me to become suicidal but now I feel like giving up now. I was so frustrated that I took too many Zoloft pills and ended up throwing up all night. I tried so hard to get better. I was finally happy. And now I’ve lost all that progress. I’ve tried everything. Zoloft, melatonin gummies, exercise, meditation, therapy, no screens, etc. does anyone else feel like this and how can I break the cycle?Edit: it’s 10 am rn and I haven’t slept yet so sorry my writing isn’t too great
NotSignal	I don't do anything all day (depression), which is why I do not feel tired at night. I need to start doing things but I am so reluctant to change and afraid of everything. Went for in-patient therapy but hospitalization wasn't a good fit for me and did not participate, since I was too depressed and unmotivated to do the therapy. This feeling really sucks, I may need to withdraw from school for some time. I feel so depressed and I know I cannot work. I'm also not helping my family out. I want to help them out and turn my life around. My skin looks so bad because of the sleepless nights. Been without REM sleep for two weeks. The simple thing for me to do would be to do something. Tonight, I am going to help my mom and do some reading. I feel happier than I normally do because I had family come over and for once in my life I did not react to their arguments. It really sucks, I doubt any dude would be interested in me and it will definitely be hard to find a job looking the way I do...Especially being a young woman. I also have BDD and other mental health issues. Nobody asks to suffer with mental illness. Also, I am afraid of responsibility. It's weird...I hate being codependent but it is what I am used to....Does anyone have any suggestions about how I can get my shit together? How I can get better sleep? How can I not worry about my appearance (which is unsightly)? How I can handle not having a man in my life? I know this sounds laughable but I really do give up on dating at this point :( &#x200B;TL;DR : young 21 year old female lost physical attractiveness due to not sleeping every day for 2-3 weeks straight. Feeling depressed and lonely because of social isolation. Overwhelmed with life stress and was too depressed for therapy. Any suggestions on how I can stop caring about my looks and start getting my life back on track? Note: I look ghastly and I also struggle with mental illness, might apply for OW or ODSP because I feel like no one would ever hire me :(
NotSignal	Maybe its this awesome moon thats got me all woke. Worked 14 hrs no break today on a physical job... Now its 2.20 am... Normally im im bed by 10 lol... My gf is passed out... Im smokin herb and watchin seinfeld while checkin out reddit. The good thing about shit sleep or zero sleep is i usually konk out hard the following day... This happens to me once and awhile...reading usually helps but not this time. I learned its better to watch a fav show or enjoy it than force yourself to try and be tired. It wont work. Just wanted to vent on here. ✌
Signal	I was wearing my fitbit to sleep for a couple of days and got a decent sleep. However last night, I felt so tired and couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore so I went to bed at 00:30. 2 hours later I was still very tired and I know I was still tossing and turning but I got so frustrated that I took off my fitbit. I feel like ive been tossing and turning all night in my bed , never even took my phone, because I was so tired I didn’t want to get up. Is there any physical signs that your body gives you after you went through a sleepless night? two weeks ago when I went through a sleepless night I had bloodshot eyes and my eyes were burning. (But I was on my phone all night)
NotSignal	Hey guys, I’m doing a project for school on things that affect sleep and i was wondering if i could poll my fellow insomniacs. 1. Does light prevent you from having a good sleep? 2. Do you wear an eye mask to bed? 2a) if you wear an eye mask do you find it’s sufficient enough to block out the light? 3. Do you have blackout curtains. 3a) do you find your blackout curtains are sufficient enough to block out the light. Thanks so much in advance all answers are greatly appreciated!
Signal	The last time I got a night's rest was a day over a week ago. Since then I haven't slept more than 2 hours a day and I've currently been awake for almost 48 hours now.I've tried sleeping pills, benadryl, melatonin after the first 2 nights and it hasn't helped. I usually don't sleep much but this has never happened before and I was sleeping well the weeks before. Does anyone know anything or have any advice. I've got exams soon and want to be able to study for them. I feel pretty lousy and just out of it during the day.
NotSignal	Just a quick post. Wirelessly the cia is capable of keeping people awake and has me.
Signal	My sleep has never been great (averaging 5-6 hours) but it was pretty manageable until about 2 weeks ago. Recently, for no apparent reason, I've been getting roughly 3hrs of sleep everyday because of waking up all the time during the night. As soon as I wake up, I feel highly alert and have heart palpitations which prevent me from going back to sleep. I feel it all started when I read 'Why we Sleep' which sort of stresses the absolute necessity of 8 hours of sleep. I know this to be kind of wrong and am trying to change my thought pattern, but it's creating deep seated anxiety that I'm really trying to get under control. Any tips?(I've already been to a GP and cognitive therapy seems very expensive).
NotSignal	There seems to be no one online. If thats the case, can someone at least direct me to a source or whatever to let me know how to get back to sleep?
NotSignal	So I’m not the full blown hypochondriac I used to be, but I still have mild health worries and along with this, I have always had anxiety issues surrounding sleep.I’ve recently been trapped in a vicious cycle of trying to get to sleep by a certain time/aiming for a certain amount of hours asleep and when I don’t achieve this/stay up too late, I start pressuring myself to fall asleep, I get anxious, and then I can’t sleep. This is mostly related to my health, I know that not sleeping the full 7hrs a night isn’t going to kill me, but I worry about the long term effects it may have on my health and this keeps me up. Additionally, I’ll beat myself up for not sleeping a healthy amount and worry about the consequences I’ll face the next day.In bed I am impatient and anxious and I’m so focused on falling asleep that I can’t. Advice?
NotSignal	Hi everyone I'm new to this sub and I hope this is the right place to post this.I've had insomnia for a long time now but as of lately it has started to become unbearable. As of writing this i haven't slept for the last 48 hours and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with taking medication and if it helped you in any way.I kind of have a bad history with psychiatrists so I'm dreading going to one (in my country the only way to get these kinds of drugs is with a prescription from a psychiatrist idk about anywhere else)So I thought I would ask here if it helped you.Any and all answers will be helpful and appreciated thank you for reading
NotSignal	I was up for 3 days one time and I started seeing invisible people walkin around my house. I kept trying to tell my parents people were here and they thought I was on drugs lol. This ever happened to anyone else?
NotSignal	So I have been going through CBT-I and it has been working well so far with me sleeping about 4 hours each night, not the optimal 8 but getting there. Below are some tips that may seem common sense but when combined are powerful. &#x200B;* Try pink noise, like waves lapping on a beach or trees rustling in the wind, increased time spent in a deep sleep.* Get plenty of exercise. 20 mins each day is a good start, just avoid working out in the hours before bedtime.* Wake up and sleep at the same time * Create a bedtime routine to unwind from the day, like reading a book or taking a bath.* No electronics an hour before because of the artificial light. (Trick: put on night mode 2hrs before, can continue using for an hour)* If you can’t fall asleep within  mins then get up and do something boring like chores or something. * Coffee has a half-life of 5-6 hours so don’t drink it after 2 pm. Also, alcohol and nicotine may make it harder to get a good night’s rest, they don’t produce naturalistic sleep (nothing can since science has not cracked that code yet it's one thing to fall asleep and another to res20t).* Consider replacing your pillows, sheets to feel refreshed.
NotSignal	Hi, I’ve been exhibiting signs of insomnia for 6 months now and want to get checked out and treated to put an end to this. I get probably 8 hours of sleep a week. But I am 18 and still live with my parents who don’t believe in mental disorders and refuse to take me to a doctor and think I’m just imagining it. How can I treat myself without them knowing/having anything to do with it?
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for quite a few years now. I’ve always had this problem though- no sleep feels better than less than 2 hours worth of sleep. If I sleep for less then two hours, I wake up feeling very anxious. Not sleeping will lead to me feeling like shit, but I’d much rather that. I also have an easier time sleeping once the sun is up (sometimes) but I do my best to avoid that and try to hold out until 8ish-9ish PM.... I won’t sleep for a night, stay tired all day but not sleep, and then when night time comes around I can’t sleep again. I also temporarily stopped smoking nicotine and it was much easier to sleep but I also felt sluggish at all times. I’m really not sure which is worse. I do believe nicotine is a main factor in my insomnia. What to do, what to do?
Signal	I've been washing my sheets and airing out my blankets on the porch at least 2X per week. Often I'll put my blankets outside to air them out at every day or second day. It's helping with my insomnia. It's so much easier to relax when my bedding is fresh, thus making it easier to fall asleep.
Signal	Due to "current events" and various other crap going on in my life I am back not being able to sleep. Got prescribed diazepam and zopiclone from the doctors yesterday so I took a couple of diazepam (10mg) earlier, drank a bottle of wine, took one 3.75 pill of zopiclone and got into bed about 20 mins later hoping for some respite from the hell I'm living just now. Anyway, that was nearly an hour ago, should I take another zopiclone? Might it just be taking longer to kick in due to the late night waffle I made myself?
NotSignal	I am 16M, and I can’t sleep more than 6 hours a night. I remember when I used to sleep 8 hours a day a few years ago and whenever I used to wake up, I used to feel amazing and ready for the day. Now I can’t do shit without drinking a cup of tea in the morning. I naturally wake up 6 hours after sleeping Any tips?Sorry if this doesn’t belong here, please redirect me to a sub where this would most likely fit.
NotSignal	After you’ve put your phone down & electronics away, you’re laying there in the dark unable to sleep due to racing thoughts, what are some of the things that run through your head?
Signal	I’ve always had quite bad anxiety- which generally show through over thinking, trouble focussing, a general fear of impending doom, panic attacks, etc. Though over the past few weeks I have been struggling with new, more intrusive manifestations of my anxiety. I have been having trouble sleeping for the past 4 weeks. I have been unable to fall asleep until hours after my regular bedtime. When I do fall asleep, it’s often from nightmares and I find myself crying so hard that I physically wake up myself and my partner. I’ve also been suffering from night sweats, which I have never experienced. I have tried various ways of managing this, and falling asleep to guided sleep meditations worked for two nights in a row, yet there was no success further than that. I’m looking to hear from those who have had similar experiences, ways in which they’ve coped and/or managed this issue. Any tips, advice or support is appreciated.
Signal	I've struggled with insomnia for a couple years due to a busy and stressful work schedule. I've tried just about every solution, After withdrawing from antidepressants two years ago, I have gotten about 4-5 hours of sleep a night on average no matter what I do or take. Last night after dinner I tried some CBD gummies I bought online on a whim from Blosum, and wow...I FINALLY was able to get some sleep. I don't know if this was a fluke, but I feel amazing. Just wanted to share! :-)
Signal	I’ve had insomnia for about 8 months now, averaging around 4 hours of sleep a night. 7 days a week. It has to easily have been months since I’ve slept a full 6 hours uninterrupted:(. Tonight, I slept a total of 2 hours and couldn’t feel more anxious and I feel like I can’t breathe.The thing is, this just feels totally out of my control. I am beyond exhausted when the night rolls around but I can’t fall asleep! No matter what I try. I listen to music, I drink tea, I take melatonin(I actually have some of the worst nights when I take melatonin), I try going to sleep early. I start to doze off and then I jump up and I’m up again. I am horribly anxious when I go to sleep, and absolutely hate it, but I try to relax. I just have no clue how to fall asleep when it feels like even in my subconscious, I can’t sleep. How am I supposed to fall asleep like this? Even, after hours of this, when I finally do fall asleep, it’s never more than 4-5 hours before I wake up.I’m beyond frustrated and afraid for my health, and when this first started happening, I figured it would pass, but here I am 8 months later, feeling the least healthy I’ve ever felt in my entire life, with an issue that seems out of my control.I’ve been to doctors, and was told I don’t have sleep apnea, and I feel like no ones been able to help me. Im starting to feel like my situation is becoming hopeless, and I wonder how much longer my body can physically put up with this. I absolutely hate this.
Signal	Just to get this off my chest. It all started when I awoke at 1 am with bad acid reflux and couldnt get back to sleep due to the discomfort. This was amidst the end of my relationship w my girlfriend who lived with me. Then my father was diagnosed with a serious cancer and I had to travel internationally (no time difference) to see him for 2 weeks and quarantine whilst caring for him. Girlfriend moved out. Stress worsened. The acid reflux worsened and itself was causing anxiety and stress on top of the insomnia. That went away, the insomnia continued. I then got hit in my car by a hit and run drunk driver. Now, father is stable. Relationship over. Car is fixed up. Insomnia still here after 6 weeks of fighting it. Causing me such stress and worry that I have sporadic fatal insomnia lol. Then my rational brain kicks in and tells me it was and is obviously precipitated by stress, and then the added stress of sleep deprivation. I am caught in this awful cycle. The only nights ive gotten any sleep at all have been when I took 2 mg lorazepam and 100 mg benadryl. Ive tried cbd oil. Blackout curtains, weighted blanket. Melatonin. Shut eye natural supplements. Lifting weight and running to exhaustion. Nothing helps. I dont take any naps either.Somehow I am remarkably able to function. I have no idea how on this little sleep. I decided this morning to go back on my ssri which i stopped 6 months ago. I used to sleep like a baby every single night while on that.So to all of you suffering. I suffer with you. I dont want to take ambien or other Z drugs. I just want to sleep normally and not stress.
NotSignal	Just hanging out here, no new stories tonight. Hope you guys get better sleep tonight, but with the way the world is I think we've all gotten worse
NotSignal	This happens to me often enough. Out of nowhere I'll just start to feel like I'm falling and it gets worse ans worse. By 3 seconds I already feel so nauseous that I want to vomit and then I won't be able to sleep for a long time.
Signal	Last night was a win! I took 15mg remeron, a little bit of melatonin, a spoonful of honey, then boom! Fell asleep within 2 hours. I feel groggy and my vision is a little blurred but I am so happy this worked.
Signal	For the last month, out of nowhere, I'm waking up at 3:30am every night. All of a sudden, BAM, I'm wide awake. Then I have crappy sleep from then until 7:30.How do I even go about figuring out why this is happening? Nothing has changed, diet the same, exercise is the same. I'm a little baffled.
Signal	Does anyone else suffer from bedtime anxiety? As bedtime approaches my anxiety levels rise, peaking when I get into bed and close my eyes, it can keep me awake for hours, just a feeling of fear and doom. The only thing I can do is focus on my breath and ignore thoughts.It all comes from last winter when I had a few nights of insomnia, I still live in fear of that returning. I find as the night goes on the worse it gets so I find myself in bed at 8pm to try and avoid it but I could still be awake at 10 or 11pm
NotSignal	For the past week, I go to sleep around 10pm-10:30pm after taking a little bit of ZzzQuil After I fall asleep, I awaken usually around 1:30am-2am and I am unable to fall back until 7am. It’s so frustrating. I usually wake up with a headache, this has been going on for a week and I’m not sure what to do
Signal	I got prescribed Hydroxzine for sleep. i just noticed when i take it early like at 9 pm i wake up a whole bunch in the middle of the night. and when i take it later like 10-10:30 i feel like absolute hell in the morning so i probably need to explore new medicine bc its knocks me out but all the side effects are just not tolerable. I took two once and in the morning i felt super surreal. like. i felt light-headed, my body felt SUPER tired, but im like also wide awake at the same time. and my body felt tingly and really light. idk how to explain it. kinda like after you pull an all nighter and your body is just like 'oh god why'. BUT my doctor's office is a joke. i called monda and they kept immediately pputting me on hold, hanging up, and then i called again and again and eventually they just let it go to voicemail and then when i left a message they never got back to me :// i just am having a hard time and i just saw my doctor and it just started happeing to me and i dont see her for a month but i dont wanna make ANOTHER appointment bc i JUST saw her friday.
NotSignal	Weirdly I dont have many mental effects of panic attacks but I do however have a very strong disrupting physiological effect to panic attacks. I get this strange pain in the back of my skull, sometimes shooting down my spine, feeling almost electric that causes me to jolt upright when pain suddenly pulses down my spine like a 1 second seizure. Needless to say this is very uncomfortable and scary and therapy helped me discover it may be panic attacks.This happens in the day, it happens every single time I smoke weed so I've quit for almost a year, and it happens often when I try going to bed;dreading staring at my ceiling for hours.Yesterday I had a massive headache. One side of my head, behind my eye and side of forehead. I think it was caused by smoking cigarettes. But when I went to bed this turned into one of the most painful panic attacks yet. Instead of being in the back of my head like normal it radiated from my headache. The lightning pain I mentioned shot through my brain instead of my spine last night and I thought I was seizing. I had my girlfriend check my pupils at 1AM to make sure they dialated, and my heart raced so hard I could hear it when this happened. After a couple more hours, walking around drinking lots of water and a cool damp cloth over my forehead and eyes I finally got a few hours of sleep. Luckily I'm not tired this morning because I have ADD so I'm on Adderall. But that was such a scary experience and I'm terrified about going to bed tonight. Luckily I have a therapy appointment this morning, I hope it helps me rest easy...
Signal	I've had great trouble sleeping for as long as I can remember, and I'm wondering if theres anything GPs/doctors can do to help? I've had trouble sleeping since childhood, with my parents being concerned about it from a young age. For a bit of history, I had severe night terrors when I was extremely young, (from what I've been told) screaming and talking to myself out of bed in the night. I had frequent nightmares when I was younger, and was often scared to sleep. This started when I was around 4/5. It gets better and worse with stress, but has never been normal and in the last few months has started to affect my job, often sleeping through alarms and having a take a taxi to work because I've missed the bus or been to exhausted to get up.I'm writing this at 1.45am, with 2 hours sleep from the night before, not feeling at all tired or like I'll sleep for a while. It usually takes me 2-3 hours to get to sleep, if I'm able to. A typical night I'd get 2-4 hours sleep, and after one or two days making up for it with a decent night from physical exhaustion.I've tried everything possible, from baths, hot chocolate, reading, silence, exercise, but struggle to fall asleep without being utterly exhausted and some audio input, usually my phone playing netflix quietly (this has been normal since around age 8-10).Does anyone know if itd be worth going to my GP to see if they could do anything? Does anyone have tips or have experienced anything similar? Its beginning to really interfere with work and my every day life, and ideally I'd like to manage to get this sorted.
Signal	Hi everyone. I go through phases with insomnia. Sometimes I sleep perfectly through the night, others I wake up. I typically have no problems falling asleep, it’s staying asleep that I do. I typically wake up around 2:45 AM and then again sometime later. It’s 6:24 AM right now and I’ve been up probably since 6:00 AM. I’m really sick of this. I take Wellbutrin in the morning and Latuda at bedtime. I’ve been taking melatonin at night but it only works sometimes.
Signal	I’m not diagnosed with anything at all, but I genuinely believe I suffer from depression and anxiety. I could go more in depth but I don’t think I need to?Anyways, I’ve always had trouble sleeping, but most recently for the past month I’ve been having an incredibly hard time sleeping. I would put my phone down and just try to sleep and for hours I would toss and turn, this isn’t just one night, it’s been over a month. It gets worse when I’m in a depressive mood or state and I’ve tried gummies, they don’t work for me. I’ve also tried benedryl, which worked once but I didn’t want to continue taking it for something it’s not meant for. I’ve been really struggling lately, I’d like some advice, or just what you think I should do? There’s been multiple times I want to seek therapy for my other mental health concerns/issues, but with lack of insurance and knowledge of where to go I sort of struggle with things like this. I could go on and on about this & my brain won’t shut off.. anyways if you’re reading this sorry for the lengthy postTrying to seek help
Signal	I am stuck in a vicious cycle. I dealt with some insane stress that had been building up over the course of a month and a half. My adrenals are all messed up I know. It started with run of the mill insomnia with racing thoughts and a difficult time falling back asleep. It evolved into being unable to fall back asleep, then I developed this ridiculous hyperawareness of my transition to sleep. Whenever I'm in pre-sleep mode and thinking weird thoughts that don't make sense at all (hypnigogic hallucinations?) I get a jolt of anxiety and shaken out of that pre sleep and I can't cross the threshold into sleep. I'm scared and I don't know how to fix it. Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone else ever experienced this before?
NotSignal	Until Thursday of last week I used to sleep 10 hours straight soon as I hit the bed, and it was always hard to wake me up. As of Thursday started to find it very difficult to fall asleep, and if I somehow managed to sleep I'd only sleep for a hour or two then I'd wake for no reason. Tonight is the worst night, I cant even fall asleep for those 1 or 2 hours and it's making me worry.
Signal	I wish i had a group of friends around my area that also had insomnia or just liked staying up late. It almost makes me miss the days of highschool where you had someone to hangout with all the time because, well we were teenagers and thats what you do lol. But now im in my mid twenties and everyone has kids and husbands/wives and its a lonely night life. I take 10mg ambien10 mg flexeril10 mg propranolol at night for sleep. Anyone have any suggestions for things i can do to entertain myself other that watch tv or clean? I live in a very small town in Michigan. The only thing open within 20 miles is a speedway and a McDonald's. Also, any med suggesttions. Ive been on these meds for about 3 years now. They seem to not help at all anymore. //sorry on mobile so formatting may not be correct
NotSignal	I feel like a bad person but I feel so ouch resentment towards my partner who falls asleep in 2 seconds and then sleeps for 8-9 hrs without waking. If I actually sleep it takes me 2-4 hrs to get to sleep and then I wake every 40 mins. On a good night I can get back to sleep in about half an hour most times but often I can’t at all. I have been 5 nights with nothing and was a shell of a person. When he says can’t do things because he is tired I literally want to punch him in the face. He has no idea. I hate feeling like this. I am so jealous. I just want to be able to sleep.
Signal	I've sleep maintenance insomnia. Have no problem falling asleep but usually wake up at 2.30 - 3 and stay awake till 6am. After 2 months of trying to find natural ways to get good sleep and failing, I'm thinking it would be better to get some medication. Are there sleep medications that work for 3 or 4 hours? Preferably I could take it when I wake up and get that 3 - 4 hours of extra sleep that I desperately need.
NotSignal	Recently for 2 days I have been only getting like 4-5 hours of sleep and its killing me since I googled and found the "nasty nasty"
Signal	My pulse has gone down significantly and I feel tired again but that's the only real evidence I have right now. Sleep deprivation is driving me insane.
Signal	Every day I get only 6 hours of sleep (I can't sleep longer than that for some reason), and end up not being able to focus on my work. I'll be able to focus for about 10-15 mins then will start procrastinating. How do you guys maintain your focus on doing work while getting less sleep?
Signal	For most of the day I feel tired but not at night when it comes to sleep time. I used to need 8 hours but now, I can only sleep at 5 or 6. I know to get rid of insomnia I need to wake up at the same time everyday no matter what. I do this and wake up naturally at 8am. How can I change so that I sleep earlier and earlier so I can sleep 8 hours?My speech is incoherent my brain is foggy and yet I cant sleep when it comes to night time.Thanks
Signal	I kinda have a question and am kinda venting I guess. I got sick around 7 months ago for a few days and out of no where, I was waking up unable to breath ever since I got better. I’ve been to countless doctors and have been told I don’t have sleep apnea. Since then, I’ve gone entire weeks where I don’t sleep for a second the entire night and only manage to get 3 or 4 hours of sleep during the day. Then sometimes, If I’m lucky, I can get 4-5 hours of sleep at night. I almost believe it’s been literally months since the last time I slept 7+ hours straight. I have been able to get 7-8 hours of a sleep if I add up, but it’s rare, and extremely rare uninterrupted. This has really been driving me crazy! I feel like absolute shit often. Lately I’ve felt a lot of digestive issues and Ik it has to do with lack of sleep because when I do manage to sleep a little, I feel a lot better. I’m beyond concerned for my health. I rarely feel like I’m healthy (even tho I am healthy medically) and am so worried about if this will begin to affect my health in the long run, or could possibly be affecting me already. Does anyone have a similar experience and do ppl know how long can you can put up with this? I never thought I’d become an insomniac and now I feel so incredibly stuck because it just seems to never end :(
NotSignal	Just wondering since when i smoke (rarely-occasionaly) i get really tired easily.
NotSignal	I know my body, mind and soul desperately needs deep restorative rest but the problem is I don’t know how to feel sleepy.My eyeballs never get that heavy feeling anymoreMy body has a hard time regulating body temperature. Most nights my face and forehead are extremely hot while my feet are freezing cold.I am sensitive to the sunlight and have a hard time breaking a sweat.Everyday feels like a struggle and challenge to get through when it used to be enjoyable and pleasant.I’m starting to think insomnia is incurable or perhaps my body is giving up on me?I don’t know anymore I just want to experience deep restorative sleep and wake up feeling refreshed instead of fatigued and exhausted yet not sleepy.
Signal	Hi all,I rarely drink caffeine or anything. Typically, I get 3-4 hours of sleep, and I wake up ready to go. Sometimes if I’m lazy I’ll get 6 hours max. Been that way since I was a young kid. As an adult I, the same way, but about once every month, I just won’t sleep for a week. I lay in bed with all the lights off and end up just getting bored. My doctor said I need to sleep more, but nothing she prescribed has worked. She prescribed benzos, Seroquel, Remeron and ambien. I’ve tried an entire bottle of zquil, melatonin, chamomile, valerian and marijuana. Sometimes I can sleep if I smoke marijuana, but I limit that to once a month. It works really well! Unfortunately, On another thread a user said, marijuana can cause insomnia and psychosis and isn’t safe to use for sleep. I only use it once a month, but gonna quit to use something safe, so pls don’t lecture. My doc wants me to try 1 mg Xanax and 1 mg klonopin with Prozac. She said the combo is safer and more tolerated. I’m not trying to be a pot head anyway.
NotSignal	Yo. I am looking for something for sleeping, that will not made me a zombie, remove some of my feelings like ssri, and at the same time I won't have to grow dosage or stop completly. This dont have to be something that squeezed in the blink of an eye, but its welcome. I always go to bed at the same time, and without any pill I fall asleep in 2-3hrs
NotSignal	Sitting here on the couch with some chamomile lavender tea. I'm tired as all hell, probably didn't sleep last night. Did some yardwork with my dad, ended up with trembling hands for a couple hours after. I''m not going to worry about it anymore, it'll just make shit worse..
Signal	Can someone give me some tips on what helps you sleep. It’s like my eyes feel so tired but I just can’t sleep I keep on thinking instead of sleeping
Signal	I have been sleep deprived for a year now. I don’t remember the last time I had a good night sleep. I get a very woozy feeling, like I am “high” I also feel like I am walking on a cloud. I get light headed and feel like I am going to faint. What are your symptoms?
NotSignal	I’m thinking about trying an anti nausea medication because they make you very sleepy. Let me hear your success stories
NotSignal	I graduated Highschool not to long ago and was one of those late night study students. I could concentrate at night only. Shortly before and since after I had my final exams, sleep was never fulfilling. I only fall asleep at 1:00 when I lie down at 21:00, Very rarely before. (GF has work early and I drive her) I have the typical racing of the mind. I can’t stop thinking. My dad is an entrepreneur and has his own company. Since I can remember he was always having trouble finding sleep. And now I’m seeing similar signs in my brothers sleep rhythm. (He’s only 11) I’m starting to wonder if it’s genetic... Is there anything like that?
Signal	Hi everyone, I posted a similar post to in r/powerlifting but it got taken down. I hope my post won’t be taken down here. I’m currently 25, in my final year of university. I began lifting about 2 years ago and I love the sport a lot. It has become a crucial part of my life. I’m also thinking of competing soon, as soon as my local powerlifting federations reopen.But I’ve been facing a problem only very recently — insomnia, as a title mentions. Even now I am typing this post after spending 3 hours in bed trying to sleep and failing terribly. Two nights ago I only slept for 2 hours, while last night I slept for about 4. The thing is, I hardly ever have trouble falling asleep. I’m wondering why I began facing these sleep issues so recently. These three nights I can fall into a light sleep easily, but find it near impossible to reach deep sleep. My brain also seems to be overly active and stimulated — I keep repeating Attack on Titan soundtracks in my head for some inane reason. In short, I am tired, but not sleepy. I have two theories in mind, and would like to seek everyone’s help.1. Creatine?I started taking creatine monohydrate this very week. Its my first time on creatine, and I’m not sure if my body is becoming too efficient in the way it is burning energy? I admit that I will be quite upset if I had to stop taking creatine so early on, especially if I have yet to see the full effects of the supplement. Not sure if this is relevant, but I also started taking ZMA and Ashwagunda this week, along with creatine.2. Overtraining?I don’t know if this is even a real reason, but I read on some forums that this could happen. I’ve been lifting pretty heavy for 6 days straight for the past 2 weeks. Might I have reached a tipping point in my CNS or whatnot? (Sorry, I don’t really know the science behind it.)I look forward to hearing your opinions and what I should do. I love lifting, I want to compete in the future, and I love good sleep. I feel really depressed that I haven’t been able to enjoy sleep or fall easily into deep sleep now. Wondering what you guys think. Thanks all.
NotSignal	before quarantine i can fall asleep in less than 5 minutes, by the time the lockdown in our place started i always stay up at past 12 am because of boredom. now that i want to fall asleep early im having troubling doing it because of anxiety, cringe decisions, etc. because of that i tend to sleep at day time which is kind of annoying because i really want to be productive. can someone pls help? sorry for my english, it's not my first language
NotSignal	I made it up. The name. The idea is to not built as much tolerance.Ok so i used to sleep quite normal till college. Now i can pull maybe a few days when i can sleep "naturally" and i still dont see the pattern. But a lot of times i cant.Anyway... What ive found that works for me 99% of the time is weed. Obviously its not a longterm solution and its expensive, but fuck im desperate. What also kinda works for me is alcohol. The problem is, with both the tolerance builds up and thats a problem (rn just financialy). I'd rather smoke before bed my entire life than drink coz of consequnces (altough i dont want to smoke everyday altough its pleasant) but thats not feasible due to future employment..So idea of 7/7 is this: smoke weed for a week before bed, then take a t-break from weed for a week while u drink for a week before bed. Then repeat: u smoke for a week while u take a t-break from alcohol for a week.So did anyone practice that? Will the tolerance still build up? Yes, i kniw its bad and not sustainable but im desperate and really dont know what to do
NotSignal	Maybe sleep from like 830-2 30, wake up, workout, shower, and then maybe sleep from 4-730 and be ready for work. Any idea I'll work?
Signal	I am so angry and sad right now. My depressed ass finally found the courage to tell my mom I suffer from insomnia and that it's driving me crazy. She just said "it's because you go to sleep late at night and wake up in the afternoon"Girl, I am glad if I sleep at all. I often go to sleep around 3-4 am and wake up at 8 am. But nooo I sleep too much and that's the problem why I can't sleep. I tried explaining to her that I don't choose to go to sleep late. She just shrugged it off and said it's my choice when I go to sleep. So I just gave up and went upstairs to cry in the corner. :)I will probably post more on this subreddit. I just found out about this so I might post some poems I will come up with while I am trying to sleep.Thanks for reading this.
Signal	I'm only sleeping about five hours a day. I know for some that's okay, but I need more rest. It's just not the way my brain works, not the way I'm wired. On top of that I'm slipping back into being extremely apathetic towards people, again. I'm just so over this "human condition".Thank you.
Signal	My doctor prescribed me lexapro to help cope with my anxiety. I’ve had sleep issues for years but for the past year it was under control. I was sleeping consistently, feeling refreshed, low anxiety, etc. Now I manage like a few bad nights in a row followed by a few good nights. My main issue is I worry too much about not sleeping, then I end up not sleeping. Will the lexapro help fix this?
Signal	I posted here while I was pregnant being concerned about how I would cope with sleeping and a baby, seeing as I'd been on sleep medication for most of my adult life and have serious insomnia without it. I didnt want to be taking the meds while I had an infant seeing as I wouldnt be as alert and the short stints with them would make me feel terrible.I had the baby on the 19th july and, turns out, a baby who only sleeps in 3 hour stints has forced me to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep. Who'd've thunk? Found it quite funny how things turned out!
Signal	New to reddit and r/insomnia. I have horrible insomnia, tired all the time tried everything but medication which is a path I’m not going to go down. If it’s an insomnia night then I will not sleep no matter what I try to do. I lay there all night with my eyes closed and my brain never turns off it feels like I am half awake the whole time and I never actually fall asleep. Sometimes (usually once a month with 2-3 days of good sleep) I will go a few days of getting good sleep but only have a few hours of those days with good energy. When I go into a state of deep sleep (rarely) i need 9+ hours to be functional. Its the biggest issue in my life and the bane of my existence. Haven’t been able to find a solid cure/solution but two things that have somewhat helped are bone broth/gelatin, and eating a large meal before bed. The worst thing is just not feeling sleepy at night and having that half awake feeling then getting up in the morning feeling like I laid there all night. The sad thing is I feel like I would actually feel better if I just stayed up and did things all night. I’m pretty lost in regards to getting sleep. Any input appreciated, good/bad/indifferent or just if you can relate what I’ve described.
Signal	Not sure if this belongs here. But tonight has been rough. Everytime I start to fall asleep, I suddenly feel like I'm dying and end up waking up again. Has been happening constantly for hours now. Does anyone else experience this?
NotSignal	Why is that? I've had insomnia for 6 years and i've never slept a full night without waking up inbetween every hour or not sleeping at all, except when i sleep next to my girlfriend.
Signal	Hey reddit, it's 5:27am and I haven't slept even a wink - again.I have generalized anxiety disorder and that's causing me sleeping problems currently. This is how my cycle goes: a sleepless night -> panic attack free day because I'm so exhausted -> I fall asleep the next night in two minutes because I'm exhausted -> slept well, body has energy to be anxious and have panic attacks -> another sleepless night.I would take an over-the-counter sleep aid, but my mom thinks (not sure) that I'm allergic to antihistamines. What are the chances that I actually am? I'm 24, and the last time I took any antihistamines was when my mom gave me some when I was 4, and apparently I had told her that I did not feel well after.I have health anxiety, and I always fear that I die, so taking antihistamines knowing that I might be allergic is terrifying to me. I don't know what else to do anymore though, I'm exhausted and want to be able to sleep more than 1 night in a row. Melatonin doesn't do anything to me on these sleepless nights.
NotSignal	Out of seemingly nowhere (in the past month or so) I’ve developed an intense fear, anxiety, and mistrust of sleep. I’m usually greeted by several nightmares, night sweating, waking up confused and in some case screaming. Haven’t slept in over 30 hours now, and I’m not really tired. I don’t really want to sleep ever again. Not sleeping for over 24 hours usually gives me modest dissociation that is rather unpleasant. Walking, talking, etc. does not “feel” right. Definitely feel like I’m going to become psychotic and delusional if I don’t sleep somewhat soon. I saw it happen to my friend and it’s fucking scary. Also have MDD with a strong diurnal mood. As in, I’m very depressed in the morning and not at night. It’s part of the reason I stay up, so I don’t have to reset the cycle and induce depression. Not sure what to do. Anyone else like this or am I alone?
Signal	so for the past few days i can only sleep at 6-7 in the morning and wake up 4-5 hours later. last night i only had 3 hours of sleep, waking up at 9.30am. however, even though im really tired i still can't sleep?? someone please reply :(
Signal	Hi I went to bed at 8 with melatonin I’ve been using melatonin like a year now but today right now when I was sleeping holy shit I was doing the same movement and trying to talk and struggle it’s like I was going to die I was trying to talk and I was struggling like Example H H e e l p p m m m m m e e and then I woke up my heart beats were like same beats per minute like super fast and it’s not the first time that happens to me can anyone tell me what is it called that happened to me if anyone knows and it’s not a sleep paralysis I think I’ve been doing research and can’t find nothing related.
NotSignal	Anybody else experience this? I read that the constant need to occupy oneself with an activity is a trauma-based fear response. I wonder if my insomnia was brought on my traumas I went through in the past? It feels like there is always so much to do that it never ends. I could go on like this until I suddenly drop dead asleep due to exhaustion. I make sure to eat nutritious meals and drink plenty of water when I have been awake too long.
NotSignal	A midterm and a lot of homework due tomorrow, and ive been lying in bed the past 3 hrs.Each passing second, every minute it's taking me to write this will make tomorrow (today) that much more difficult.I just need to know it gets better.
NotSignal	This is so strange to me. If I go like 3 hours of sleep or less I get lots of pain in my upper-back towards the end of the day the next day. It's so soar it actually hurts. Sitting and lying down just make the pain worse so I have to lay down in a very strange position so it doesn't hurt. Then after a good night's sleep my back is fine and back to normal... Then it happens again after I get only a few hours of sleep again.
Signal	In early August of last year, I had an episode of total insomnia that lasted about a week. This happened after weeks of deteriorating sleep quality and weeks of disturbed sleep. After visiting the emergency department at hospital, I was referred to a psychiatric hosptial (the looney bin) , where I spent a week, taking sleeping aids and a couple of other medications. After a week there, my condition improved, and I was able to sleep again. Unfortunately, towards the end of the first week of September, I relapsed. I once again spent a number of days at the mental hospital taking much larger doses of medication, although this time I wouldn't sleep but 'zone out' for a number of hours. The nurses who would come to check on me from time to time reported this as me sleeping, however I didn't get any restful sleep. I have since been discharged from the hospital, and have been followed up on and outpatient basis twice. I told my consultant psychiatrist that I still wasn't sleeping, and that my condition was deteriorating. In response, my medicine dosage has been steadily increased. Despite this, I have been getting less and less rest. My condition is now so bad that I'm desperately posting for help here. I'm taking 20mg olanzapine, 10mg valium and 300mg quetiapine and not getting deep sleep. I wake up multiple times at night and feel completely exhausted the next day. I don't have a support network that can support me financially or otherwise, and I need advice for care. I literally haven't slept since September and I feel like I might be on the verge of hallucinating. I no longer have the energy to cook and take care of myself, or go in to work. I'm taking a cocktail of powerful drugs every evening but they have absolutely no effect at this point.
Signal	Considering I get roughly 3-4 hours of sleep every night, I'm starting to reconsider whether I should actually go for a Phd. Despite being passionate about the topics I am learning, I have a constant headache throughout the day studying. I can't even think about anything remotely complex without becoming extremely tired and groggy. When I try to get a nap to recuperate, I can never fall asleep. Sometimes I feel better doing a mind numbing activity like watching TV. I'm just wondering have any of you guys excelled in academia? I'm starting to feel hopeless in the midst of all these other students who are teeming with energy meanwhile I am a complete disaster.
Signal	I get bouts of insomnia where I cannot sleep until 5am and wake up at 8am. The following week or so will be the same regardless of exercise, diet, light exposure and supplementation eg. glycine, magnesium, melatonin.Which of the following drugs will produce the least neurological side effects from anticholinergic activity or GABA excitotoxicty/downregulation etc. Which would you personally use?Diazepam, Promethazine, Mirtazapine, or Baclofen
NotSignal	How to make it easier to fall alseep? Any pills or anything? I was at my desk at about 1:30 AM so so tired and I lay down to go to sleep and nothing...it’s now 5:15. This happens too often. When I do manage to fall asleep it’s waking up at least once or twice and not getting nearly enough of it
NotSignal	Hey everyone. The TL;DR is I’ve had sleep quality issues most of my adult life. Had a sleep study done and was diagnosed with very mild rls. Been medicated (gabapentin) with minor success and had a second study done. That one showed zero leg movements (yay), but a ton of arousals, and absolutely zero N3 sleep. Neither did the first study. So without deep sleep it’s no wonder I’m feeling like I’ve barely slept. Anyone want to help me armchair quarterback the analysis? What else should I look for on the report to give me clues on what to discuss next with my doc? Three specialists and a host of residents and nobody can figure it out. No apnea either. Thanks!
Signal	So to make a somewhat long story short - my boyfriend and I decided to move closer to his parents & grandparents while we were still able to for the time being. They are older and as such they are having a tough time being unable to go out to get themselves groceries and supplies without risking themselves (his parents are in their 50's and his grandparents are in their 80's).Unfortunately in order to do that we made a 20-hour drive non-stop over to them. Now normally I'm really good at falling asleep in the car - but due to the circumstances and the fact that I was driving half of the time, I probably got around 1-2 hours at max. When we arrived at the house we swiftly went to bed and I only managed to get another 4 hours.Much to my dismay - it hasn't really improved since than. We made the journey Sunday, so it's been around four days since then and I've been napping more than I've been sleeping. For the most part I've gotten four hours here, two hours there, 30 minutes etc. Wednesday was probably the best I managed to do, sleeping 6 hours and than taking an additional 3 hour nap during the afternoon. So I thought, rock on, I'm getting it all sorted./nopeCouldn't sleep a wink tonight, scratch that, I got 20 minutes - and its now 9am and my head is killing me. I'm certain the drive messed with me, it was extremely anxiety enducing and before then I'd been sleeping quite well - I just don't know how to go about fixing the mess that is my circadian rythme this time around. I don't think I'd actually be able to stay awake the entire day to reset it (if my body allows me to nap).
NotSignal	Seriously, if ONLY I could get 5 hours. After withdrawing from an antidepressant I have gotten about 3 hours fragmented sleep a night. 5 hours would be a milestone to me. I understand that it's not the case for everyone.
NotSignal	I woke up from a nightmare and have only got two hours of sleep. I’m not busy today but should I just see if I fall back asleep?
Signal	I have some pretty gnarly insomnia related to my anxiety and BP2. I got 2 scripts this week for both Xanax and hydroxyzine for sleep. After reading online and Reddit for some firsthand accounts (I like to see how others react, how quickly it kicks in, etc) I’m nervous for the side effects.Xanax for it’s addictive properties and how it doesn’t really get you into a proper deep sleep. Hydroxyzine for the 2 day fog side effect.Has anyone used either of these and can give me some advice, tips, firsthand accounts, etc? In the office she was great and very clear and I left feeling confident and equipped. Oh the perils of the internet!
Signal	I stayed with a friend for awhile and slept naturally at their place. This goes for a lot of times I am sleeping in other places. At my house, I often have a hard time. Even if I take melatonin or Tylenol PM. Weed used to help, but I cut that out. I listen to meditation music and just lie there. Do not look at my phone much, only to see how much time has passed. Again, this is really only at my home. Then if I go stay elsewhere I will often oversleep since it feels so good. My house definitely has a bit of spooky vibes, but I am not alone here and I have no reason not to be able to. My brain just will not shut up here.
Signal	So, I’ve been struggling with insomnia for the past 3 weeks. It’s a straight up MIRACLE if I sleep for two nights in a row. I cant do this anymore. It’s worsening my already present depression and making me suicidal once again. I tried everything! I workout everyday, don’t eat 4 hours before bed, no dairy or meat, no electronics an hour before bed, etc. It’s at the point where I take 30 mg of melatonin and it honestly doesn’t do shit. I feel like I’m slowly going insane. I have a doctor’s appointment today and I’ll discuss it with him and ask for sleeping pills. If they don’t work, I honestly feel like I would actually kill myself in that case. Those who have taken sleeping pills before, which work and do they work at all??
NotSignal	Someone recommended this app. Problem is I use android and it isn't compatible with my device. Does a similar app exist?
Signal	Anyone else feel like your doctors won't listen or don't believe you?My sleep hygiene is impeccable, and without going into the complicated nature of my routine (which I begin 2 hours before attempting sleep) believe me when I say I've tried *everything.* I do everything I can to reinforce healthy, natural, sleep behavior, but I still cry my way to sunrise without medication. I don't really want to go into all the medications I've tried because this would be a very long list and I've tried dozens, but suffice it to say Ambien is the only one that works 99.9% of the time, though I can get by on a THC tincture alone during a particularly good stretch. I don't want to be on Ambien for long, for obvious health-related reasons, so I go a few months on and a few months off. But every doctor I have spoken to has had trouble believing that I actually struggle this much with sleep. I'm not sure if it's because I'm a petite young woman who they will naturally struggle to take seriously, or if everyone with a prescription pad lacks a decent amount of empathy, but I'm so sick of having to prove myself to these dead-eyed drones who see me as a number rather than a person. And just a small rant - I've recently started Ketamine treatments which has worked wonders for my TRD, but wreaked havoc on my sleep schedule. My issue has always been falling asleep, but now I'm struggling to stay asleep as well. I wake up every morning at 4:30 (often after serious nightmares which were never a problem before K) and struggle to get back to sleep for several hours on end. This was supposed to be a passing symptom but it's been 6 weeks and I'm going to need a Ketamine booster quite soon. Discontinuing the ketamine is not optional, as I genuinely believe it's saved my life. It really doesn't help that my psychiatrist is hell-bent on removing me from any sleep meds. I mean I get that, that's a common goal of ours, but she's trying to accomplish it without listening to any of my needs. I've gone through so many doctors and have lost all hope of convincing any of them that I'm struggling. It's just not possible when they aren't willing to listen. How am I supposed to convince a person who I only speak to for 30min every 3 months that I struggle this much with sleep, and that my insomnia is not a passing fad? It feels like a rhetorical question at this point, because the answer is always, "I can't."If you've made it this far, thank you for listening to my rant and I hope you have better luck with your treatment than I do.
Signal	Sigh.. I need to vent a bit as I’m feeling really disappointed. I was making so much progress over these last couple of months. I made sure to keep to a schedule, have good sleep hygiene, make sure I’m betting certain vitamins and minerals, I eat specific sleepy fruits at night, stay away from caffeine after morning, get enough sunlight, etc etc. it got to the point where I was falling asleep between 11-12 (but still waking up a lot and sometimes struggling to fall back asleep) and I still was only managing about 3.5-5 hours of sleep usually. But I was happy about getting to sleep at a decent time, opposed to 2-3am. I did have a few bad nights here and there, but I thought it was normal since every night can’t be perfect. But the last 4 nights in a row everything kept failing me. Up till 1-2:30 in the morning even after taking 50MG of Benadryl...I did nothing different... yet everything failed me. I’m afraid I’m going to go back down the insomnia hole of getting to bed late and relying on some form of medication again. 😞 I’m hopefully going to start a new job next week and I’m afraid my sleep will mess up my job performance. I was getting used to waking up at 4-5:30am and now I’ve been waking up at 7:30-8. Not good. Unless my subconscious is low key anxious about the new job, therefor effecting my sleep, or it was hormones from PMSing... then I have no idea why I’ve suddenly gone back to falling asleep late. I haven’t had 4 nights in a row of getting to sleep late in like.. 3 months? I know it doesn’t seem like a long time but I was happy with my progress. Sorry for the rant. Just feel defeated, lol.
Signal	First off I don’t actually have insomnia but I have problems falling asleep. Without medication it takes around 1-2 hours to fall asleep usually but it’s a painful process because the longer I lay awake the worse my anxiety gets that I won’t be able to fall asleep. So that’s why I take medication for it. Currently I take muscle relaxers (Zanaflex 6mg and baclofen 20mg) and melatonin 5mg. It works okay but still probably takes around 30 minutes to fall asleep once in bed. I recently tried remeron but one night I had this weird ass blind spot that I think was caused by it and since then I haven’t taken it. It scared the shit out of me. So what else should I try? Seroquel doesn’t seem like a good option because I take adderall in the daytime and it does the exact opposite of adderall. I’ve heard people say it makes adderall much less effective the next day. So what about trazodone? Or any other suggestions? Thanks
NotSignal	Hi, short story.During the las week i improved a lot.Everything is free in my mind and i know how i have to act in the hard times. Because for me it is clear, that the problem is anxiety.And i have just have to accept, that some things happen.But these good feelings or the knowledge fades during the day, when the anxiety comes back, even for a bit.Has anyone a tipp, how i can keep the good stuff in my head.And believe the things, that the anxiety tells me?
NotSignal	I’m hoping this is last week on first shift, honestly dread getting up every morning at 4am due to waking up constantly and tossing and turning so I will be telling bosses i can’t help them on 1st anymore
Signal	As someone who has struggled with insomnia for a good portion of my life, I feel lead to share this testimony with you to shed some hope to your situation. Just a quick background story, insomnia hit me out of nowhere in my mid 20's. Ever since, I've tried just about everything under the sun to help overcome the painful struggle I was going through. From sleeping pills, Benadryl, herbal supplements, vitamins, yoga, and meditation.. all while practicing good sleep hygiene. Eventually, I resorted to drugs, smoking pot day/night and drinking myself to sleep for several years to mask the pain. That seemed to knock me out but I knew it wasn't a healthy alternative.If any of you have heard of Sober October, I decided to give it a try because I was addicted to various substances which were getting out of control. I was determined, so after my 3rd day sober something miraculous happened. Not sure what it was but something within me wanted to take advantage of being sober and get in touch with my spiritual side. I was never a religious person. In fact, whenever someone spoke to me about religion I would cuss them out and brush it off. I grew up in a Christian household but once I was able to make my own decisions I immediately walked away. Somewhere along those lines I heard that God is love, so during my 3 day sober period I decided to sit alone to contemplate God and try to reach him if i can by sending him "loving vibes". Thats when a sudden shift in my life began. I kid you not, for the next several days everything Jesus began to pop up in my life. From seeing posts online, to an old friend asking me about him, family mentioning him.. it was impossible to ignore. Being a skeptic, I thought to myself what in the world is happening?? Thats when I began to read about this man Jesus, I started reading about other peoples testimonies online and going through some bible passages here and there. Mind you, nobody in my household knew anything I was going through at the time. Later that same week, while all this Jesus stuff was still happening in my life, I was walking down the hallway of my house, then low and behold there was a Bible just sitting there. It felt like a scene where there was light shining down onto the book and God was saying "Read this". I began to get alone and read through the New Testament. I came to the conclusion that this book was divinely inspired. I realized, what a selfish life I've been living all along. Life was revolving solely around myself. I was using drugs, alcohol and others to make ME feel good by any means necessary to mask the pain I was feeling inside. Thats when I said a simple prayer that went something like, "God, I've been living like such a mess. I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done and hurt I've caused others. I no longer desire to live like that. I believe in you Jesus and I welcome you in my heart. I submit my life over to you, do what you please."That very night I slept like a baby and I haven't had a single craving for any of my addictions since that very day! People go through rehab for this stuff and it was gone in an instant with an added bonus that my insomnia was healed! Its like Jesus took all my wrongs and blessed me with a new slate. Whether you think this was just a simple change of perspective or I really did have a supernatural encounter with the God of this universe it's up to you to decide. By no means do I share this to cram religious down your throats, as I've been on the receiving end before. In fact, if I can be so bold to say that religion isn't as important as having a loving relationship with the God of this universe. I share this testimony in hopes to encourage you, because I know the suffering which accompanies insomnia. What a curse it is.. I just want to emphasis something though. I never came to Jesus to be healed, in fact it wasn't even on my mind and I never prayed for healing that day. In other words, our motives have to be in the right place. If we come to God mainly because we want something out of him, it is still driven from a self centered place. I believe we must come to him in complete submission because we realize our brokenness and our inability to save ourselves. Anyways..Thank you to those of you who bore with me and read through such a long post. I realize this might not be popular on here, and if I get downvoted for it then let it be. But I pray it gives you encouragement and hope for a bright future with plentiful of replenishing sleep! God bless, much love.
Signal	still not even tired after 50mgI have Klonopin, but usually that doesn't help eitherbesides that all i have is Tylenol PM and alcoholwhy is something as simple as sleep feel so impossible to get? my tizanidine doesn't get filling until the end of the monthI feel like i am never going to sleep again and i hate it i hate it i hate itwhat do you so when ambien stops working?
NotSignal	An other night of sleeping 3 hours straight then waking up every hour 😣....
Signal	Been suffering as a life long insomniac and also anxiety, it got really bad around the end of 2019. I managed to have it under control with self therapy and will power , before this dreaded 2020 came, came and ruined it all.... I advice to whoever is suffering , don't delay getting help. Specially as a middle aged 45 year old the not sleeping is really affecting my physical help too.
Signal	I do everything I'm supposed to ,limit my time in bed,get out of bed when I'm not falling asleep etc...but my sleep is still terrible even though I've been doing it for 5 week. I still wake up in the middle of the night. Am I doing it right ,is there any better method to beat insomnia? Has anyone found success from using CBD oil? That might be the next thing I try
Signal	Have you ever done this? I cannot seem to fall asleep until like 4:00 a.m. and I'm waking up at 1:00 p.m.. Don't get me wrong. I'm thankful that I'm actually sleeping. But now my sleep cycle is all messed up. So I'm thinking about staying up tonight and then I'll be so exhausted that I should be able to fall asleep with the help of medication by around 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night. Has anyone ever done this to reset themselves? Good idea or no?
Signal	Hey everyone, I’ve been struggling with recurrent episodic insomnia since I was three. I never sought out treatment for it (mostly because of parents) but now that I’m in college I finally went to the doctor for it.My doctor is now asking if I would like to switch to either doxepin or rozerem, so I’d like to ask the people of this sub about their experiences and advice.Here’s what I’ve tried for reference:•Melatonin - little to no effect on sleep generally, even when used with other medication•Advil PM, Nytol, all the OTC stuff - once again, little to no effect. •Trazodone 200mg - no effect, insomnia worsened and dry mouth as side effect•Gabapentin 200mg - worsened insomnia, and heartburn as side effect•Mirtazapene 7.5mg - sedation worked (started having dreams again!), but side effects (constant hunger, weakness, and tremors) caused discontinuation.I don’t want to seem like a drug seeker but my insomnia is quite bad and the mirtazapene had bad side effects, so I’m leaning away from doxepin and towards rozerem. What do y’all think?
Signal	hello fellow insomniacsso I've been in a month-long phase of chronic migraine and insomnia. Pain so bad that I can't sleep but sleeps so bad (/non-existent) that the migraine persists. Finally got in to see the doc and of course, medication was prescribed. Almotriptan for in the moment pain (which is wonderous) and a low dose (10mg) of Elavil (amitriptyline hydrochloride) for migraine prevention and assistance with sleep. To take regularly. So Cannabis has helped me a great deal with pain, but of course, it doesn't have an incredibly long-lasting effect and I have to keep dosing etc. I haven't quite find these "knockout" strains that people keep talking about, or they just don't work for me (but please if you have recs. lemme know). I'm very much concerned about Elavil in the sense that it is also a tricyclic antidepressant and I've worked really hard to stay off of those types of drugs so it feels weird to be prescribed that (and also having your doctor not tell you that it was an anti-depressant as well... that was weird).TL:DR? \- have you tried elavil what's your experience\-what are your "knockout" cannabis strains (also preferred method of consumption for long lasting effects)\-which would you go for over the other?
NotSignal	This week has been awful. I've been able to get only a few hours of very shit sleep during the day and I lay awake at night. Sometimes I'm so tired but I can't sleep. Is staying awake during the day to reset schedule a good idea? I've done it a couple of times before, and I get really tired/sleepy during the day, but at night I get so anxious at the thought of having to sleep and end up being able to sleep for couple of hours at best. Sometimes I have good sleep days though, at best I can get 12-13 hours and even feel sleepy/tired when I wake up. Do I have insomnia or is this a stress related issue? What advice would you give me?
NotSignal	Anyone else can’t sleep because life is amazing and you don’t want miss any minute of it?
NotSignal	This happens on an average of 2 times a week. Whenever I'm about to drift off asleep I am suddenly paralysed and unable to move, and sometimes I feel a hand wrapping around mine, or I feel myself being tickled, and I end up desperately trying to escape it's grasp my moving my fingers and awaking myself again. Rinse and repeat about 10 times or even more, I never really counted, but it's a long loop of being woken up, drifting back to sleep and awakened again.Is there any known causes for this?
Signal	I’ve always been a night person and have chronically gone at least one night a week without sleep but it’s gotten so much worse lately and I feel like I keep reaching this point where I’m so so tired it’s painful and yet I still can’t sleep. Anyhow, has anyone else felt like it’s been worse lately and anything you’ve done to help?
Signal	Idk if this is the right place to voice this. I get insomnia often so I take zzquil and it helps but the taste is, sometimes, unbearably strong. If I were to water down the full 30ml, would it still be just as effective?
Signal	So I am pretty sure the birth trauma and the head injury I have when I was 5 is the reason why I have really scary and fucked up dreams . Thus why I am unable to sleep at night . Plus the trauma of being raped and sexually abused as a child most definitely contributed to my insomnia . I am being treated for ptsd and in counseling.The melatonin helps sometimes if I take them at the right time but it can worsen my nightmares . I have several nightmares that I can still vividly remember ranging from when I was 5 up til now . The thought of falling asleep at night terrifies me , i don’t have night terrors every single night but I do have them often . They are all bad . I had dreams about demonic possessions , rape , biting my own thumbs off , falling into the waterfall ,and many more . I have many nights where I don’t sleep at all and purposely try to stay awake so I don’t have to wake up with anxieties and have a really bad morning .I am actually considering visiting a neurologist because I am really tired of my insomnia and nightmares .
Signal	Hey guys, It's currently 10:34 pm on a school night and I just finished arguing with my parents about sleep. They started complaining about how I drink energy drinks to stay awake. I told them it takes me hours to fall asleep and even then I wake up multiple times in the middle of the night. And then in the morning when it's time for me to get ready for school I have 6 alarms set, every one of them 10 minutes apart leading up to 7:00 am. I am late to school nearly every day because I sleep through 3 of my alarms and then snooze the other 2. I told my parents I want to get help for my sleep so I can stop relying on energy drinks and soda to keep me awake. They tell me to stop using my phone/computer 30 minutes before 10 pm so I can sleep easier, they tell me to stop drinking caffeinated drinks but if I do that I fall asleep in biology class and drop my D+ to an F, they tell me to exercise more because even if my minds tired, my body isn't. Which is just a bullshit excuse to give my dad a freebee to bitch about my inactive-ness. It's so frustrating. I've tried so many things. Last time I slept well I had smoked weed, and it worked a charm but I don't have an every night access to it and I'm only 16, and it's illegal in my state. Melatonin doesn't work either, not strong enough, but I'm scared to take more than one because I'm a fairly skinny dude and I don't want to accidentally overdose on sleeping meds. I'm just tired of the bags under my eyes and the constant burning from tired-ness on my eyelids. I'm tired of spending $10 a week on energy drinks when I barely have enough cash to spend on anything else. I just want to sleep normally. Please help.
NotSignal	I keep waking up between 1:30-1:40am and 3:40-4:20am this happened twice each and every single night for a week now. I recently recovered from having insomnia and this weirds me out. How do i solve this?
Signal	It’s two AM and I can’t sleep. I haven’t slept in 17 hours. I am on two different sleep meds (trazadone and melatonin). I have maintenance insomnia and onset insomnia. I usually have very light sleep and wake up frequently. I also have a lot of lucid dreaming because of all the light sleep. I have considered getting someone to hit me with a baseball bat to get to sleep. One time, I hit my head and slept for 6 months (coma). That was the longest and best sleep I have ever had. Another time, I stayed up for 7 days by drinking red bull and coffee mixed together. I call it bull coffee. One time, I could not sleep and I got so desperate that I even tried watching Netflix for 12 hours straight (Netflix helps me go to sleep sometimes).I want people to know my sleep story. Well, that is one of the reasons. The other reason is that I am bored since I am just lying in my bed playing on my phone. This post is almost over. I will continue to discuss the things that keep me awake at night. I have a lot of stress from various things. My nocturnal guard dogs bark all night. I have depression. I can’t sleep.
Signal	I don’t plan on using recreationally, even tho I use opiates and benzos when I have the chance which isn’t often. I’m pretty sure ambien isn’t even that recreational anyways as people have really mixed reviews about it.
NotSignal	Ok I’m kinda concerned... when I get normal sleep is 3 to 4 hours then I wake up then go back to sleep.. do I get into rem sleep?
NotSignal	How come some people are tired all day but can't seem to be tired or go to sleep at night? I know it sounds like a dumb question considering the subreddit I'm posting this to, but I'm genuinely curious as to why this happens.
Signal	Hey everyone. It's 3am here and another night of the usual. I just cannot sleep. I don't drink caffeine or alcohol. I get ready and have a 'wind down' routine. I feel like my mental health is beginning to deteriorate now. I'm up so late feeling restless and anxious, with whirring thoughts. And I'm lonely. It feels like I'm awake and the rest of the town is asleep. WTF is wrong with me? I cannot shut my brain off and it's like my body is actively fighting sleep. I have bought over the counter sleep aids (antihistamine in a different package, basically) and I can fight my way through those. Like I feel the tiredness but my body is like \*YOU WILL STAY AWAKE\*. Tomorrow I'm going to be agitated, have headaches, mood swings and feel blinded by the light all day. Then at night I'll be back to feeling like a horrible person, lonely and anxious. Thanks for listening
NotSignal	Has anyone experienced sleep improvement after getting their deviated septum fixed?I’ve had insomnia for the last decade or so and only in the last few years did I realize I have an extremely deviated septum. I’m hoping that by fixing it I’ll be able to sleep and live a normal life again.
Signal	Brand new. Took 5mg last night and slept 8 hours. I feel great today! Highly recommend you look into it. No rebound insomnia after a year and no withdrawal in clinical trials. Also maintains good sleep architecture. I don’t plan on relying on sleeping pills. But it’s nice to find something as a backup that’s not a benzo.
Signal	Difficult night/morning again. Averaging 2/3 hours of broken sleep a night/morning. Having a awful effect now as ita been going on for over a.month. Anyone got any tips or tricks? Almost tempted to head butt a wall but I'd only have to fix it later (the wall!)
NotSignal	Hi Reddit, so it’s 4 am where I am and this is day 3 of me getting absolutely no sleep. I have a constant severe headache and am so exhausted that even blinking seems like a tedious task. I have been stressed about my mother getting covid symptoms (she’s fine now), my ex not giving the tiniest crap about me after I unwaveringly supported him through 9 months of emotional hell as his dad passed away, and I am PMSing too with terrible cramps and unusually heavy bleeding. My mind is on overdrive. I have taken mild sedatives and CBD to no avail. I can’t help feeling like it wouldn’t be the worst thing if everything ended. I’m not suicidal by any means, just won’t bother me if the world did end. My ex is a nice guy and I don’t want to resent him but I’m baffled how selfish people can be to take all the love and affection being showered on them and have none to give back when the time comes. I left no stone unturned to take care of him. I have woken up every day with my first thought as what can I do to make him feel loved today and slept with the assurance that I made him laugh or smile or just made his day better than yesterday somehow. It hurts that it doesn’t matter to him at all that we won’t grow old together. I feel so alone. And so stupid for investing in him. His feelings are gone when he has to make a commitment or take care of me, but he has enough to lean on me and fuck me. I feel cheap and used. And maybe none of this is true, maybe he’s just having a hard time and this isn’t about me at all. But insomnia can trick your mind into believing the worst about yourself. The pain is adding to it nicely! Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambles.
Signal	I haven't really been able to sleep that much since corona break started. Almost every night I'm taking about 15 mg of melatonin cause idk what levels are dangerous and I'm afraid to go higher and I'm also taking Zoloft and magnesium citrate when I remember. My psychiatrist said it's anxiety but nothing that used to work does anymore. The sun's starting to rise and I know I'll be exhausted and I'm just so tired but I can't sleep
Signal	I’ve dealt with recurring insomnia since high school but have never really sought help or advice from a professional doctor/therapist/psychiatrist. Most of the time it’s bearable. I take seroquel right now (looking to switch to something else soon) which helps, but some weeks are particularly miserable and this has been one of them. It’s the 3rd or 4th night this week that i’ve managed to drift off (usually around midnight-1) only to wake up between 2 and 3AM, unable to go back to sleep. Today i’m especially fed up because i have some pain and a headache, and it just seems there’s nothing i can do to relax. I’ve tried breathing techniques and would say they work 25% of the time (for sleep, anyway). I’m mostly writing this as catharsis, so maybe getting this out will help. Suggestions are welcome either way.
Signal	So I’ve had hypnagogia for awhile now and I also have trouble staying asleep. My sleep schedule is pretty chaotic and all over the place. I’ve noticed that I have hypnagogia for YEARS now. The hallucinations are much worse and more intense if I’m stressed. I’m just wondering if anyone suffers from this and how to fix it. I know a strict sleeping schedule helps... and that’s been an on going process for years now too. I can’t seem to force myself to wake up with the alarm so I end up going back to sleep, and oversleeping, which causes me to go to bed later and later. Does anyone know what caused this and how to fix it?
Signal	Ive started taking ambien for sleep and man this works so well. I have been kinda going off the wall with it and basically finished half my 30 day of 5mg in a week. This is definitely not for me, and I will probably use mirtazepine once I meet my psychiatrist. How long have you guys been able to use ambien at safe levels; moat importantly no tolerance and dependence?
Signal	So, I've been insomniac as far as I can remember (it's been linked to my ADHD/Anxiety) but I've had Night Terrors for only a year or so. It's always the same, I feel like waking up, see shadows surrounding me (they are really similar to those in Allan wake) try to move and well nothing happens! At the beginning it was genuinely fuc**** scary. But after so long having always almost the exact same "night terror" I've weirdly grown accustomed to it. It's still deeply uncomfortable but it's become an almost daily occurance. So my questions are does anyone have similar experiences with Night Terrors? And does anybody has an explanation to why this is happening? (AFAIK I haven't found anyone having similar experiences :/ )
Signal	Insomnia and I are old foes , been going through it since I was 15 . I feel as though it's caused by my racing intrusive thoughts and even normal calm ones . I'm a coder so sometimes I code till the morning or just watch documentaries till I fall asleep . I just want to know how to calm the thoughts cause it's getting to the point where things are starting to move on their own and sounds are sharper than usual and I'm Aspergeric so I'm hypersensitive to the senses . How do sleep before becoming sleep deprived.
Signal	Why is it that I can sleep the day away no problem and yet even when im tired and actually Want to sleep at night I cant seem to! Ive tried listening to various sounds and songs and guided meditations and tried meditation on my own and journaling, tried just turning everything off at a certain time and reading or just laying there to try to fall asleep and its like I just cant until I literally pass out from exhaustion. Ive tried sleeping stuff like melatonin and other types of sleep aid but it never seems to have much effect. Im just tired of being up at night! Ugh
Signal	I have been suffering from this for the past 2 months now, my issue is that I just cannot get quality sleep. I am a type 2 diabetic and it has me concerned, Im sure some you know that if you do not get good sleep its not good for your sugar levels but so far I have been able to keep my sugar levels under control despite having this sleeping problem.I've tried everything from melatonin,gaba,valarian and at one point when the insomnia was so bad I had to resort to a sleeping pill (this was a while back) which I only used for 5 days for relief from this thing. Are there any natural remedies that can be done to help fix this? I know its a silly question but what are some of you guys doing to cope with this? To be honest Im not sure what to make of this, part of me thinks it might be sleep apnea that Im not aware of or its just my lack of exercising thats triggering this. I use to get this insomnia maybe once in the week or twice and it would go away for months on end but during these last 2 months it seems to be chronic. From 2013 to 2015 I use to work in shifts and they were quite brutal to say the least we did 7 days mornings > 4 days off > 7 days evenings > 2 days off > 7 days night > 1 day off, Im not sure if this is what messed up my sleeping patterns all those years ago but its been 5 years now.
NotSignal	Like it says in the title I can’t seem to break this habit. My alarm is set to 6:45 am and my body will wake up at either at 4am or 5:30 am like clockwork. Sometimes both times in one night other times just 5:30am. I go to bed between 10:30pm - 11pm. I fall asleep very easy. On the weekend I have no sleep issues whatsoever. It’s only on work days. When I do wake up at these times it’s almost like my anxiety starts and it keeps me away for 20-30mins before I can fall back to sleep. I’ve used deep breathing exercises, counting backwards, and even mediating. Please give me your recommendations, I’mopen to anything!
Signal	For a while, I sleep around 3am and wake up around 11am. I've been trying to reset it/even just maintain it by setting my alarm earlier by 30 minutes.My body clock keeps drifting though, i only end up sleeping later and later. now i sleep around 5am.I still try to wake up around 11 even if it's less total sleep hours, but it's extremely difficult and exhausting.Only time i wake earlier is when i suddenly wake up from anxiety and have little sleep, (sleep at 4, wake up at 8)Any tips to help me get a more consistent pattern and wake up earlier?
NotSignal	Anyone get upset stomach from Ambien? I've been prescribed it for insomnia but am scared to take it because I don't want it to make me sick. Is this more of a rare side effect or is it common?
Signal	You see i play games with my friends and get off around 1-2 am other days I’m able to sleep but just some days where I can’t at all. Like today, its 5:16 and try to sleep and cant. I’ll try to cut back. But just any other advice will help. I have my alarm at 9:30 am to wake me up but I don’t sleep on the same time constantly. Just need help. I feel scared a lot of times but calm myself most of the time.

NotSignal	Recently, (last 2 months), I've been having trouble falling asleep. For me there are 3 states of consciousness: awake, almost asleep (1/2 conscious), and asleep (unconscious). When I lie in bed and reach the almost asleep phase, I feel VERY uncomfortable and it keeps me from falling asleep. I feel it mainly in my chest, sometimes pinpoint able right below the sternum. Sometimes I get a weird feeling in my right forearm that is only relieved by rapid movement or physically applying a lot of pressure (lying on top of it, hitting it (not hard enough to bruise but hard enough to hurt). Bottom line is that it's very uncomfortable and makes falling asleep at night a terrible experience because I'm in that hella tired state and really want to go to sleep but physically feel pretty awful. I've tried going to bed at different times, music, meditation, and sleep stories. What puts me to sleep is eating something, waking all the way up, and then finally falling asleep.Any thoughts? Has anyone else experienced this?
Signal	This is probably one of the worst episodes I've had in a while. I've started having paranoid delusions from sleep deprivation and I literally just came out of an episode of paranoia a few hours ago. I felt like Aliens were watching me and looking into my brain, I've gone to therapy my whole life to deal with several different aspects of my life (grief, my parents divorce, etc.) insomnia is one of the big things I've learned to deal and learned to identify when I'm having a paranoid episode and distinguish delusion from reality. I'm scared that if I don't get a good night sleep I will develop hallucinations. I don't have melatonin with me and am out of my home city (Mexico city) staying at my family's lake house for quarantine as a way to be in a more relaxed environment. The problem is none of the two pharmacies here sell melatonin or sleeping pills since it's a rural area. I don't know what to do please help.
Signal	For me, it’s a little after 3 Am. I pass a little anger and sadness episode and then I’m just fully awake. I try to at least shut my eyes until the sun comes up to at least say that I got some shut eye. So yeah, that’s my story, what is y’all’s story?
Signal	Basically, I remember dreaming but feel like I was never asleep even if an hour or two went by. This happens all night long from 4am to 9am. It just feels like I haven't slept and I still feel exhausted. Not sure what is going on…
Signal	So I (19F) am convinced I have some sleep issues. The past year or so I have started waking up around 3-4 times a night before my alarm. I tend to go to bed around midnight due to staying up late doing homework. I’ll sleep fine from 12 am until 2:30 and stay up a few minutes before falling asleep again. I them wake up around 3:15, 4:45 occasionally, and again at 5:35 before my 6:45 am and 7:15 am alarm goes off. I wear my Fitbit when I sleep and that’s where I’m getting my times. What ends up happening is I have to constantly drink something with caffeine in order to get through the day. I am currently on something that helps my anxiety so I can sleep (75mg of Trazadone nightly that I take around 11:30) and it works but I still wake up.
Signal	when i was 16 i started to suffer from insomnia, like not sleeping for 2-3 days at a time. i was also suffering from a mental illness. With the help of therapy and meds and all that fun stuff by the time i was 18 i was pretty much back to what “normal” was for me (8 hrs/night). however, i am now 22 and i can feel it creeping back on me. in the last month i’ve gone at least one day a week without sleep. i feel good mentally, i just don’t know what’s wrong or how to go about it this time around. any advice is appreciated!!!
NotSignal	I don't really know if I have insomia or something else.I don't know much about the topic. I just cannot sleep, when I lay down I get existential and stuff and when I call down I can't sleep, I kinda started to fear going to bed for the reason that I didn't want to get existential. I've been staying up 24-56 hours no issue with an 8-9 hour sleep in between those day long periods, and my vision is now complete dog shit I can't see past 5ft ( I had glasses but my vision was still decent enough to around 10ft) I've tried nyquill, laying down early, nothing works. I thinks it's insomnia but like I said I really don't know shit bout the topic.
NotSignal	I just waste my days, why should I get to reward myself with a nice, long rest? Or maybe that’s just the depression talking. Or the fact I stopped smoking two days ago. Who knows.
Signal	(i am so tired so sorry for the chaotic nature of this post)this is the 5th time ive pulled an all nighter this week. i go to bed around 12 ish, which is already late, but still, i literally lie in bed for 7+ hours tossing and turning and unable to go to sleep. i sorta start to get relaxed and feel comfortable enough to go to sleep most of the time, but i just wait and wait and wait and never do. i usually think complicated thoughts in order for me to fully doze off and go to sleep, but thats not helping at all anymore. sometimes i literally cant keep my eyes shut and its driving me crazy. i usually end up staying up till 8 or 9 and taking a 4ish hour nap, and just remain drowsy throughout the entire day, hoping that im tired enough to fall asleep at night, but the cycle continues. i hate feeling like this and i want this to end so badly. i have massive headaches from not sleeping properly and its driving me insane. what do i dooooooooo
Signal	Have not slept without tranquilizers in 3 years but want to attempt to stop taking them, advice?As the title suggest for the last three years I have used various medications for sleep and am at a point in my life where I’d like to be able to sleep without medications as the side effects are beginning to become more severe. For the first year it was an experimentation going through the following medications: Temazepam, Ambien, Xanax, Klonopin, Trazadone, Hydroxyzine, Cannabis (THC and CBD in various combinations), and a few other OTC medications. There were various issues with the aforementioned medications that always resulted in either the medication not causing me to sleep from the first dose or the medication losing its ability to put me to sleep after a few weeks. For the last two years I have been prescribed seroquel for sleep, taking it nightly, and starting at a dose of 25mg which was increased to 100mg over the course of the last two years. Infrequently but sometimes I have had to take Clonazolam (the RC) in addition to Seroquel to get to sleep but for the most part the seroquel did exactly what I needed. Prior to these prescriptions(and seemingly out of no where) I would go several days without a wink of sleep. That caused huge issues mentally and physically and thus started my journey into sleeping pills. I really am just looking for advice from anyone who has relied on sleeping pills for extended periods of time and/or has severe chronic insomnia. I also am curious if anyone else has experienced similar insomnia where you went your entire life sleeping without major issues and out of the blue go days without sleeping? -Side note: I know the withdrawals for seroquel are quite unpleasant, I attempted two days without taking seroquel and even after 1.75mg each night of clonazolam (the RC) was unable to sleep and was extremely physically ill, though it was no where near as painful and daunting as benzodiazepine withdrawals. So I’ll be meeting with my doctor this week to discuss options to get off seroquel in an effort to avoid the discomfort.
NotSignal	I wake up every night around 2 am to go to the bathroom but can’t fall back asleep afterwards for the life of me. Anyone else experience this and have any tips? I start work at 6:30 am and this is killing me.The only medication I take is a multivitamin. Could this be causing it? I’m a 36/F, 25 lbs overweight, not diabetic.
NotSignal	I've tried all over the counter meds that you can get your hands on, from Melatonin to sominex to unisom And how I'm on temazepam and I already got immune to it or something I've been up for 74 hours... Does anyone have any suggestions?
NotSignal	Sleeping in my car has been a godsend.I know my insomnia is associated with my home life, I don’t have the best one and it causes me a lot of anxiety, and recently the focus on not being able to sleep at night has amplified its severity.Well, after literally six nights of not sleeping, I put some blankets and sleeping bag in my car, put a little portable a/c with a power bank, and my weighted blanket in there...I was out within an hour. I did again the next night and fell asleep right away. Last night, same thing. I don’t know the psychology behind it, but I can fall asleep in hotels, and apparently in my car. Does anybody else find a change of location drastically helps?
Signal	Hello everybody, First off i'd like to greet you all and tell you that having a community that actually understands what going through this is like, and seeing how helpfull and advicefull you all are is such a relief to me... Thanks. Now my case...I'm a 21 year old Colombian student who's been around 20 days without any more than 2 or 3 hours of sleep per night, and when i have them, i have then splitted in parts cause I tend to wake up every hour. I've tried zopiclone and It didn't work at all, and I also tried Olazapine and this one put me in a weird state of "Artificial sleep" since I guess I slept, but I woked up super tired... So now, I am in vacation but in less than eight days i'm back in college and I don't know how I'll survive if I keep this insomnia; My question then, is pretty much what the title says... Would willfully avoiding bed or any other attemp to sleep or rest for 3 days help since the fourth you'd be so tired out that you would sleep for very long? has anyone tried it? what resoults did you get?..Plus, another question,my under eye skin somethimes itches so wildly and I've gotten the worst under eye wrinkles I've ever seen ... do they dissappear if you get back your sleep? what do you guys do to get by with that? in order to make your eyes not look so badly? Thanks again, sorry for the poor English, and my most sincere simpathy to you all, We will all beat this condition !!
Signal	My mom (51F) since last autumn has not been able to sleep well and until the recent two months, things got worse she is not falling asleep at all without sleeping pills. We initially wanted to fight it without medications as those don’t address what is beneath. But my mom just constantly stayed awake for 2 to 3 days and had like only 2-3 hours sleep and she felt exhausted all the time. We have visited so many doctors, but all she was given were some anti-depressants and some sleep pills. And the doctors kept asking if she was depressed or anything related to life. For the record, my mum has nothing to worry AT ALL, she has been a stay home mom without much worry since early 40 (not financially not anything else, what she does everyday was some casual activities, and her diet and habit are almost as healthy with nutritional balance and abundance, she doesn’t smoke nor drink) and she was equally confused by this trend as the rest of my family. Our family is very close and I see her every day and she is generally very positive person, if something happened that made her depress, we would know right away and she wouldn’t keep it from us. Anyway she lately experience some fluctuations on her temperature sometimes it goes below 35C and she doesn’t feel warm. And obviously feel uncomfortable around her chest area (maybe due to lack of sleep). We believed she reached her menopause that may worsen some of the symptoms (she had her uterus removed 5 years ago since then she did not have periods so we don’t know for sure if she had reached menopause). And she lost weights for 10kg in the recent two months. Which is scaring us. Additionally, she doesn’t feel like eating at all and we are unsure if this has to do with the side effects of the medications. Strangely her heart rates were normal despite she felt some uncomfortable. Before last autumn, she had some mild symptoms like headaches and dizziness but she could fall in sleep easily. (She used to sleep up to 10 hours a day 8 hours at night and sometimes 2 hours for afternoon nap. ) there was one possibly related episode that she got food poison from a crab that got her into the hospital and she said her head was like explosion, we guessed that has damaged her neural system by symptoms like significantly worsened memory and had to pee like every hour. But she eventually got better after 1 or 2 year until now. We just couldn’t untangle everything now and want to ask for help about what we could do in terms of diagnosis and medications. The obvious question is what could cause this insomnia in the case, I mean here many talk about how they can’t sleep without why, some attribute to stress but some just feel physically. Is there any scientific theories that explain the causes. 1. Can she rely on sleep pills for like a long long time say the rest of her life? We are so worried that she developed tolerance so quickly and what if medications some day don’t work in helping her sleep. What are some strategies that counter tolerances and dependence. Is there sleep pills that don’t let you develop tolerance quickly. 2. What neural diagnosis can we run, obviously we have visited many doctors but they just don’t seem to care at all and keep pinning things to stress, myself had battled OCD and depression back in teenage and college, I know one when I see one and for sure my mom doesn’t remotely have. 3. Has anyone been through menopause that suffered the same problem, I read it is common for elder women. And what are the ways to mitigate?
NotSignal	Has anyone tried them? Seems like they’ve popped up on a featured end cap of all the grocery stores I go to, but at $12 per container I’d like to hear if anyone else has had luck with them. If they help, even a little, they’d be well worth the price to me
NotSignal	Does anyone else get this sensation where their brain feels hot or buzzing, but you don’t have a fever? It’s not brain zaps because it’s more constant than that. It prevents me from sleeping.
NotSignal	I’ve properly struggled with sleep for just over 2 years now. It got worse when I started uni and I would only function on an average of 2-3 hours of sleep a day. At the end of last year, I was in an LDR and when we met, I slept so quickly and literally like baby. That was probably the best sleep I’ve had since my sleeping problems started. Whenever I’m struggling to sleep ( which is quite often nowadays ), I literally dream about that evening and the sleep I had. Now, we’re quite on and off and obviously quarantined. Sometimes, I just want to say fuck it and ask him to come sleep with me ( once the pandemic is over ) but maybe it was a fluke? I don’t know!! Has anyone ever had this?
NotSignal	Hi everyone! I'm at my wit's end. I have had insomnia now for around three months, with absolutely no history of sleep problems. Although I have always had anxiety and stress, about three months ago I went through something really stressful (a health issue where I was told I had a stroke, then like a month later, told I didn't, with no explanation of why it changed? ) I suddenly developed a sleep problem. It varies, sometimes I can't fall asleep initially, but then sleep through the morning. Then other times I can fall asleep, but then wake up in the early morning and can't go back to sleep. I always wake up all through the night too. Also, when falling asleep, my chest feels right like I can't get a deep breath. I honestly don't feel that stressed, so I am having a hard time believing this is due to an underlying anxiety, but that's all I can come up with. I've tried sleeping pills and they don't help. I have done all the regular suggestions for sleep hygiene and caffeine intake, nothing helps. Has anyone ever experienced something like this, and did anything help? Any feedback AT ALL would be appreciated! What breaks though that anxiety loop finally??? I am hesitant to go on meds as I never have before. I am 36 and female! Thank you in advance for any feedback!!
NotSignal	i normally drink coffee in the morning which obv helps, but i still feel more energized today then when i’m actually able to sleep like 5 hours
Signal	over the past few weeks i have been falling asleep then waking up (very calmly, no jerk) right as im about to pass into a deep sleep. and then it takes about 15 more minutes and im asleep. this sometimes happens 1 more time and then im out for the night.i am working with my therapist on sleep, but im curious if anyone else has had this issue? i sometimes think my body isnt tired yet and i should go to sleep later.history: i had terrible insomnia, then switched birth control pills and it went away. now recently over the past few weeks ive been having this issue. its not awful, but i'd love to fall asleep and stay asleep :( wouldn't we all :(
NotSignal	I’ve had a pretty hard time sleeping after suffering a moderate TBI: skull fracture, severe concussion, and subdural hematoma. It sounds worse than it was, on the scale of traumatic brain injuries I probably came out pretty lucky (only minor mental defects ~2 years post). I’m a little stuck on where to go from here. I always had a tough time falling asleep growing up but nothing anywhere close to insomnia. Not even sure if I would call what I’m experiencing now insomnia, but this seemed like the best sub for advice. Immediately following the injury I slept a lot due to recovery, pain meds, and basically anything I did exhausting me. That lasted a few months Here’s what I’m dealing with as of now...About 1-2 nights a week I don’t sleep at all. This used to never happen. Only started up a couple months ago. I never just fall asleep on my own. If I drink alcohol that helps (don’t really want to make that a habit though obviously), melatonin does nothing, I took diphenhydramine a few times but it gives me restless limbs so I get super tired but can’t sleep because I feel all tingly and have to move or scratch my legs/arms constantly. I try to limit screens before bed but when I’m just laying there in the dark my thoughts start racing and I start to feel wide awake. I’ve always had nightmode turn on at sunset and have started listening to podcasts before bed instead of tv but to no success. The only nights I really feel like I get a full night of rest are when I can’t sleep the night before. I think my own thoughts are probably the biggest culprit of what’s keeping me up at night. I’m my own worst enemy I assume. But I also get sharp pains where I fractured my skull and these weird little jerks the second I start to have a chance at sleep. Again, my body is out to get me. I take adderall and Wellbutrin which I started not too long after my TBI due to prolonged issues with concentration. I’m sure these don’t help but I haven’t noticed any changes to my sleep since starting them. I don’t drink caffeine most days, some days I’ll have ~100-200 mg in the morning. I kinda feel like medications are the next place to turn to but I’m worried about potential side effects. Despite not sleeping well I feel like I still get along with my day okay, except the days I don’t sleep at all. Obviously I feel like I’d do better if I was fully rested. But I also recognize that I’m not at the far end of the spectrum, plenty of other people have much more detrimental sleep deprivation that severely inhibits their daily functioning. Basically I’m not trying to be a bitch about it. I don’t want to go to my doctor asking for pills when I don’t really need them but I don’t know what to try next. Also Jesus Christ sorry for talking so long I’m so bored and I did not proofread this so
Signal	Hi everyone I'm taking 50 mg of Zoloft for depression and anxiety I've only been on it for 6 weeks and I've been doing pretty well except for the problems with sleeping. A friend suggested I try Melatonin. I tried 5mg and 3mg. I had an ok sleep on the 5mg but was groggy the next day. The 3mg tablets had B6 included in the formula I think this disagreed with me because I had the worst sleep of my life ! Now I just feel tired all the time, lethargic, no energy and I feel a bit down ! I also dreamt quite a lot and I don't usually dream?It seems melatonin doesn't agree with me, is this possible?
Signal	For the past few months, I've been having awful insomnia. I couldn't fall asleep if i tried, and when I did fall asleep my quality of sleep was garbage. I've had symptoms like: hard time falling asleep, not feeling tired/interested in sleeping, racing uncontrollable negative thoughts as I tried to sleep, kicking and moving around a lot as I slept, waking up tired, etc.I've also been smoking a lot of pot. Self control is oh so hard, and I buy in large quantities. Large as in, a quarter pound at a time. This meant that I had more ganja than I could ever possibly hope to smoke by myself. This also meant that I had absolutely nothing stopping me from smoking every single minute of every single day for the foreseeable future. I mostly avoided doing this because I wasn't interested in raising my tolerance.I believe that a combination of the pot and the insomnia was contributing to my depression as of late as well.Recently, I decided to quit the ganj because I was so tired of not being tired before bed -- and it frickin worked!!! I stopped smoking like 4 days ago and now I have no problem with falling asleep at 10 pm, and getting up at 7 am. I saw Zzz_96's post and decided I would share my success story.Hang in there guys! I know it sucks but you can fix your sleep someday, some way! For me, it was removing the big source of dopamine that causes me to lose any value in sleep or other activities that usually don't get you high. Maybe there's a way to fix the chemical imbalance in your brain too! Feel free to use the comments to share your 2 cents.
NotSignal	Hey guys, I am currently suffering from insomnia for around a month averaging 5 hrs of light sleep a night. Before this I slept 8.5 hours every night no problems. My question is, for the people with severe insomnia, how long did you have it for and how was your sleep before your insomnia onset?I am asking because I want to see if my situation is normal as this seemingly happened out of nowhere.
NotSignal	I really wanted to start waking up early for this year but it seems hard because I can't fall asleep early. Any suggestions how to overcome this?
Signal	Content warning: Death, abuse, violence I catastrophize (thinking of the worst, most traumatic scenarios constantly) in bed every night. I always think of the people I love being brutally harmed or even murdered when I try to sleep. It makes no sense and I have no way of controlling it. It ruins my sleep every night. I cannot remember the last time I got at least 5 hours of sleep in a night. I stay up for hours, tossing and turning, thinking of my boyfriend or loved ones being shot, beaten to death, or chopped up in my face while there's nothing I can do. Or a brutal terrorist attack taking them out. And I think and think myself into anxiety attacks, which can be worse than the catastrophizing. No sleep or ASMR YouTube videos help, I'm too broke to afford real meds, and my job is very demanding. How does one cope with such a thing? I just want my brain to stop.
Signal	I have had trouble sleeping for years. It would take me hours to fall asleep and then I would wake at the smallest thing (a toilet flushed on the other side of the house, a light turned on in the hallway, need to use the restroom) and then falling back asleep was almost impossible. I know stress was part of my problem but i just could not turn my brain off. i was an ambien user and it worked great for awhile but then started to work less and my dr was more interested in weaning me off then increasing my dosage. I have not had Ambien in almost 1 year and I was always exhausted and frustrated with lack of rest. I was reading some posts here and one poster ( I wish I knew who) said they had success with Pharma GABA and a Melatonin combo. I thought "what the hell" and ordered some. Success. I fall asleep like a normal person now. I often wake but find it MUCH easier to get back to sleep. I cried the day after my first night with this combo. i just wanted to THANK THAT POSTER! It was life changing for me and I am grateful to that person so people keep posting your successes. You never know who will read it, try it and find the help they need.
Signal	Background info: 27y, male, no physical chronic diseases, normal weight. Diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and Panic Disorder (I also suspect undiagnosed POTS because my heart rate is generally high and even higher upon standing).So I've been suffering from fractured sleep for the past two weeks pretty much. I only get sleepy really late (like 3 or 4 in the morning). And when I finally do lay down to sleep at this time, I just toss and turn for literally hours. Yesterday I managed to get 3 or 4 hours of sleep, today almost none, like an hour and a half at most. Before this, I was already also getting early awakenings and not being able to go back to sleep.And of course since I have major Health Anxiety, along with generalized anxiety and Panic Disorder, I get worried that my body forgot how to sleep or something. As I type this post in the late afternoon, I don't feel sleepy at all, just drowsy and kinda slightly drunk feeling. If I lay down right now, I won't even be able to nap. It feels like my mind is exausted, but my body is too wired. I get adrenaline surges and random tachycardia along with this (this is pretty constant, already had a full cardiac workup and no heart issues were found).Does anybody else feel this way? I read and hear that most people when they can't sleep or barely sleep during the night, they'll pretty much get knocked out anytime during the day from the tiredness, but with me it's the opposite. My body just won't let my mind shut off. I'm getting desperate because I feel sleep deprived and can't get any relief, and can't stop thinking about this Sporadic Fatal Insomnia disease, which is making me so scared and even more desperate.PS: I take 0.5mg Clonazepam daily for my anxiety, as prescribed by my psychiatrist, but it doesn't really help me get sleepy, despite its sedative properties. And because of this covid crisis, I won't be able to get an appointment anytime in the near future to get some proper sleeping meds, so I'm pretty much on my own for the time being. I just want to "crash" already and sleep like 12 hours straight, but it seems so unlikely right now. My biggest problem is the sleep onset. I can spend hours and hours tossing and turning and nothing.Any help and support would be greatly appreciated.
Signal	All my anxiety about it piles up throughout the day and I know I don’t have it. But these past couple of nights, it’s been getting harder to fall asleep. This morning I fell asleep at 6. Yesterday was 5am. The other day was 4am. It’s so. bad now. And real quick. What are the first onset of symptoms for sfi? Is it insomnia, or does that come later?
Signal	I feel like this is the best place to talk about this so here it goes. since the age of 7, I have taken melatonin every night of my life. since then there's been times I had to double the dose because it wouldn't work, and then cut back again because THAT stopped working, and now that I'm trying to stop taking it (I mean seriously I've been taking it for more than half of my life..) i find that it's impossible to stop. I stay up until 7-8 am without it and even then wake up with 3ish hours of sleep. the only thing I've found that works for me is CBD. I was told I could start taking it due to anxiety, but really it knocks me out lol. even now that's not starting to work though and I'm trying to not have to take more and more. I've wanted to try a melatonin vaporizer so that I could try to shorten the dose until I get down to nothing, but I'm a minor and my parent dosent approve of it. (I've tried explaining lol she really won't budge.) I suppose my reasoning for posting is to see if anyone has any solutions to stop taking it. I think this social distancing time is the best time to as well because I have nothing to wake up for lol thank you all for any replies in advance.
NotSignal	Sorry if this is a bit incomprehensible, I'm totally knackered right now. I've never had any problems sleeping before. I am a a night owl, however, so I usually don't feel tired untill 2 or 3am in the morning, then I sleep till noonish. But last night, I just didn't get sleepy at all? I shut off my phone around 4am, later than usual, and I just couldn't fall asleep. I wasn't tired. Around 8am I gave up and decided to study, but I was too tired to do that, so I went back and flopped into bed. Then I think I ended up getting an hour of really light sleep then but I might not have.The story is probably irrelevant. My question is, is it normal to just one day become an insomniac? Should I be worried at all? Please tell because I'm curious to know.
NotSignal	I’ve had terrible insomnia these past three years. Recently however it’s gotten much worse. I barely sleep and when I do it’s never restful/restorative. I’m deeply afraid I might have FFI as my cognitive state is beginning to deteriorate (memory and attention.) I know this is also a symptom of chronic sleep deprivation but I can’t get it out of my mind that I might have this disease.
Signal	I’ve been an insomniac for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I’ve always functioned mostly fine. I have intense grogginess in the mornings and trouble waking up, that’s typically the worst it gets. But a few years ago, I fell asleep behind the wheel. Since then I’ve been diligent about sleep hygiene and I’ve been on sleep meds. The thing is, sleep hygiene has yet to do anything and whenever I take a sleep med I get a few nights of good sleep before my tolerance builds up and up until I’ve maxed out that medicine. Am I doomed?
NotSignal	I’ve heard of hypnic jerks that feel like you’re falling or your whole body jerks, but what is it called when your hands make little involuntary grabby movements right as you fall asleep?
NotSignal	It’s driving me so crazy I wanna die and I don’t know what to do
NotSignal	Im new to this subreddit, and I read posts where people usually get out from the bed to drink something or do anything else when they can't sleep... Im 17, i cant sleep until approx 5-6am and I cant get out from my bed at night because if i make some noise my dad will wake up and start fighting me and send me to bed, so im the whole night in my bed, doing nothing and getting hungry. At least he is allowing to be "awake" until 2-3 am because of quarantine
NotSignal	230 and i have to wake up for work in a few hours. I look forward to the weekends when I can drink myself to sleep. Good times
Signal	My psychiatrist has me take xanax, ambien, and lorazepam nightly.Have finally been able to get restful sleep at the expense of some pretty intense dreams.
Signal	Today is day 2 of 0 sleep. I am 32 and have insomnia and went back and forth from ambien to trazadone to seroquel, you name it and I was prescribed it...i am in recovery for substance abuse so all i take now is melatonin and either nyquill or zzzquil. I am so tired that when i finnaly get to lay down in bed after my 14-16 hour work days and I still can not sleep. My mind is racing, i start picking under my nail on my thumb, and i can't stay still. I even use a stress ball but nothing is working. I have an appointment with a nuerologist in 5 days and i pray that the nuerologist can help me. I have currently been awake for 48 hours and and i have a 16 hour work shift at 9 a.m. I feel like im losing my mind and I don't know what to do. Any suggestions will help. Please, I am desperate and I need sleep, thank you!
Signal	I lay in bed exhausted and try to sleep. I'm not sleeping. I have to sleep or else I'll live tomorrow as a spectator again. Too much is as stake I have to sleep. I'm not sleeping. My heart starts racing. The night is long but the hours past me by as if they were minutes. I count the hours I can still get a few. I check the clock one last time. It's 5 am. The alarm starts and I wake up. It's 7 am. The sunlight bleeds through my curtains. It's a new day but all I want is for it to end.The day has no value and my night gives me no refuge.What a life.
Signal	It's been going on for months now and it's making me crazy. I can't fall asleep any earlier or else I will just lay in bed for hours. This is terrible. Literally the same time every single morning.
NotSignal	Literally spent an hour in bed and my mind won’t stop running. I am more awake now than when I went to bed an hour ago. What the hell.
Signal	Literally nothing else besides this pill I’m on helps me sleep. Looks like I’m going 24+ hours without sleeping again :”)I hate insomnia where if I don’t take medicine, I don’t sleep for 2+ days in a row. Thought it would be appropriate to post here.
NotSignal	It’s been a month. 4 consecutive sleepless nights -> Got prescribed ambien for a week-> Still had got sleep maintenance problems even with that -> Off ambein for about another 3 weeks -> Problem still persisted -> Back to sleeping 3 hrs a night since past 3 nightsI don’t want to enter the pill life I’m just 21ButFeel like gonna be on ambien for the rest of my life.God I hate when it’s night.Also, my voice of panic often convinces of SFI, which is kinda stupid but I can’t help itI keep reading about the I’ll effects of insomnia which is like a long list of diseases and am convinced I’d be dying pretty early eitherway.Sorry it’s been a rant but I’ve been frustrated, I feel like I’ll have to live my rest of the life like a zombie.Please suggest me something
Signal	Is it possible to misuse or become addicted to trazodone? I was feeling anxious and wanted to take a pill to feel better. I also thought about taking double quantity to sleep better. Is this bad? Has anyone had similar experiences?
NotSignal	Hi, I've recently quitted smoking marijuana and one of ghe symptoms I got was insomnia. Everytime I try to sleep my chest and stomach would jerk up, as if I was having a hiccup. I've googled and it sounded like a propriospinal myoclonus. It's not at ads bad as it was when I initially quit, but it still interferes with my life much, as now I am only able to sleep at 7am to 2pm. If I try to sleep at night, I would get slight jerks. Has anybody experienced this?
NotSignal	But we share the same Room,which is kinda complicated.This has been going on for a while now,and unlike him i have a Very Very soft sleep. I wake up to the least noise. He is 3yolder than me and tbh he is a narcisist cunt. He screams,laughs,make all the sort of noises with his friends in call.. i tried to talk,but he Will always start a fight and attack me personally to "defend" his point. He Will threat me,humiliate me,saying i don't have a job i am neurotic and my sleep issue has nothing to do with it. Right now we had an argument and he said If i keep on talking he Will beat the shit out of me. Then i answer: "If you do i will cut your neck with a knife and killl you". Then he procedes: "Then you will spend the rest of your life in jail". We live in a rented house,and i never worked. He worked for 2years and saved 10K,so he IS the one who keeps us financially and pays almost for everything. I live with my mom,him and stepfather. I don't know what to do anymore, my own brother tortures me psychologically and uses all my weakness against me. Im stucked in my own house. I havent had a decent night of sleep since last month,and all of this is Just triggering my insomnia. I need help
NotSignal	Not to ad but its the kind that has blackout circles so if you open your eyes its 100% blackout. Have only been waking up once through the night as opposed to several times. My windows unfortunately face a street that has street lights. I'm a fairly light sleeper as it is (my wife getting up wakes me up for instance). Just wanted to tell others in case you are lost on things to try.I have some earplugs and I have been wanting to use those too but unfortunately they sometimes irritate my ear:(
Signal	I've had a hell of a time these last few months with getting to sleep. I've ALWAYS had problems sleeping, even as a baby and all through childhood, the teenage years and up to now, as being a thirty-something adult.I've tried every bit of advice under the sun, changing sleep habits, changing before bed habits, cutting off screen time, head massages, ASMR...I have tried very nearly EVERYTHING I can think of or the Internet can provide an answer to and nothing seems to work for more than a day or two. It's been worse with the pandemic. My job was declared non-essential in March with a hesitant re-opening next month, but with the resurgence of the virus I doubt it, or there will be such major changes to limit exposure so it'll be another ball of stress and flip-flopping schedules.But the problem isn't just anxiety. My mind is unquiet. I am constantly thinking. Even during my work year, even if I'm exhausted coming home, my brain is always in rapid motion. The only reason I've been able to maintain a sleep schedule during my work year is through the heavy application of Mucinex, 800mgs of Ibuprofren, an antacid and a full cup of Nyquil or Zzzquil.I essentially have to nuke myself into a medicinal coma in order to fall asleep at night.This is the ONLY way, for the past thirteen years, that I've been able to go to sleep, and it's never a 'restful' sleep. I toss and I turn. I have vivid, exciting or stressful dreams that I can consciously control or alter because I unfortunately learned how to lucid dream (on accident). I'll wake up long enough to realize I'm awake and then (hopefully) go back to sleep.That is, if I make it to my bed at all. After I nuke myself, if I miss my 'window' and happen to pass out in my chair for as little as ten minutes, the moment I wake up my brain is refreshed and I have a window of about two minutes where I can successfully get to bed and back to sleep. 98% of the time this doesn't happen. And then, you know, there's the added risk of Hendrixing because of of all the medicine. More than once I've woken up having been choking in my sleep, which is fucking scary.And now I'm reaching the age where insomnia can start severely affecting your health, especially when the only way I can get back to sleeping all night is through forcing myself to stay awake for twenty-two hours with a brief nap around 1pm, or trying to 'catch up' with myself by going to sleep around 9am in the morning and trying to stay asleep until 5pm or later to force the cycle back on track.And again it doesn't help because my mind is unquiet. I don't know what to do at this point. It has always been a problem in my life but it's never been this bad. I don't understand people (like my partner or my parents or...well everyone I actually know) when they say that they 'oh yeah I just slept until 1pm, got up and did some stuff and went to bed again at 9'.What is it like to just be able to sleep whenever you want? To not have your grey matter doing constant flipflops in your skull with new creative ideas or just thoughts? To be able to go to sleep without forcing yourself into what amounts as a medicinal coma?I just don't know what to do and it's starting to really get to me.
NotSignal	Then I can get up an hour later because I still can’t sleep
Signal	It is 640 am and I am so afraid of falling asleep because I keep having terrible nightmares. Last night's main nightmare was running around worrying about where to hide a decapitated head. I can't lay down. I have never been able to lay down. I usually just let the office or parks and rec play until I can pass out. But I still wake up every two hours. This is very much interfering with my life. I can get a sleep medication but I hate them so much. Is there anything else?? I am going crazy.
Signal	I’ve been having so many debilitating sleep issues, that have gotten worse lately.I was scheduled for a sleep study but it is postponed indefinitely due to covid obviously. I am certain they would diagnose me with some sort of sleep disorder because what I am experiencing is not normal/healthy. For now, I just need to freaking sleep. Please, someone give me suggestions.Right now, I am having horrible headaches due to the poor sleep i’m getting. I took Advil PM last night and thought I can fall asleep, I wake up after an hour or two. I just cannot stay asleep. I keep waking up and then have anxiety attacks bc of it. Issues:•Falling asleep but waking up after an hour/two•Intense sweating and waking up drenched (not normal for me)•Shortness of breath that gets worse when trying to sleep (no, I don’t have corona)•Intense headaches due to poor sleep•Intense fatigueI ran out of my Ambien prescription (which never helped me stay asleep anyway) and all I have right now is Advil PM and Unisom. I don’t know what I can take that will help me stay asleep and I can’t see a doctor for this atm. Help!!!
NotSignal	White noise and bassy reverbI have been an insomniac since I was 7 and have had onto try to figure out how to trick myself into falling asleep for years. When I started writing and recording music I tried to hypnotize myself with soft melodies, and a dreamy sonic environment which I could usually achieve with a ukulele, with heavy bass reverb and some additional white noise. Some songs worked to put campers to sleep when I was a counselor, and fast forward to a few nights ago, my sick girlfriend asked me to sing her to sleep and suggested I make a virtual bedtime concert. So I did that, and added the same bassy reverb and white noise to help put people to sleep.
Signal	When I’m sitting in the couch or shopping in the grocery store I feel like I could go to sleep right then. In bed, when I’m comfortable and in my pajamas, I don’t want to sleep. My brain thinks of things like going on my phone or about something someone said to me. It’s like when I get in bed and decide to sleep, a switch flips to make me feel awake. I become more awake when I should be winding down for sleeping. It isn’t even anxiety anymore, my mind just feels sharper and I think about things more clearly. Does anyone else have this problem?
Signal	You could ignore the title since I really dont know what to call this exactly but for the last couple of months my quality of sleep has been getting worse and worse to the point where some days I wake up the next day unrested...like I dont know how to explain this but it is as though I dont get any REM sleep at all. Im not sure if this could be related but I was a smoker for the last 6 years but not a heavy smoker like I only had 2-3 cigs a day and everything was fine for the most part until a year into my job which was shift work, that was when the sleep problems started happening and it kind of crept up and got worse overtime. At first it was just sleepless nights where I would just shrug it off go to work do my job and crash at home and sleep for 12 hrs, this use to happen about 1 to 2 times a week at most for about a year into my job which was back in 2014.This was about the time I got into taking herbal supplements for sleep such as Melatonin/Valerian, Melatonin never did much for me and I never had any side effects from it like the bad nightmares people have reported but the Valerian had an improvement on my sleep and I would wake up very refreshed the next day, it was great but it didnt last as the supplements only gave me temporary relief and later it had almost no effect on my sleep for some reason. I resigned from that job to pursue a masters degree and during that time the Insomnia was kind of off and on like sometimes I would have no issues sleeping for 3-4 months and suddenly the Insomnia would strike for weeks sometimes an entire month. I was able to boil it down to it possibly being from smoking since I understand nicotine has some really bad effects on your sleep. So I decided to quit smoking and lay off caffeine completely for about a month and man did my Insomnia come back stronger then ever. After the bad Insomnia I was getting some decent sleep and I made a big mistake of getting back into smoking, I just finished a pack and Im going to try to quit but this time for good. I think the cigarettes and my caffeine sensitivity ( I cant go over 1 cups of coffee a day) as well as being abit depressed due to not finding a job yet is all contributing to my Insomnia also I have some anxiety but only when Im pressured while doing work and etc.I dont have any options here and I can't really talk to people or my parents about this since they simply wont understand what Im talking about and will just recommend religion to cure all my ailments so Im making this post to get some feedback on what you guys might think the problem could be and if sticking to what Im planning is a good idea before having to resort to professional help. I dont want to have to end up having to take sleeping pills cause we all know its not a permanent solution. Also can you guys recommend any natural supplements for depression and anxiety?, I have a feeling these two might be whats really hurting my sleep.&#x200B;P.SI left out that I am a type 2 diabetic on Janumet and from what I gathered online there have been reports of metformin causing Insomnia in some people also the time I was diagnosed with it was in 2014 around the sametime my sleep was deteriorating so there could be a connection.
Signal	When I am trying to sleep, I can hear my alarm going off very faintly in my head. Even if it's no where near the time my alarm is going to go off. Sometimes I hear it in the day as well, and it makes me feel nauseous. I'm not sure if its anxiety of sleeping, lack of sleep, medication (I'm on 100 mg of Zoloft), brain problems? I have no idea but it just started, and its making my shitty insomnia worse.
Signal	Hi so i’ve always had on and off troubles with sleeping and at first it just started with me not being able to stay asleep but slowly escalated into me not being able to fall asleep. i’ll stay awake to 5/6 in the morning and then wake up around 12 usually. and even during that sleeping time i wake up around 4 times during the night or even more. i’ve tried meditation, sleep music, melatonin pills and gummies, CBD gummies and even CBD pens (that has been the only thing to help me fall asleep but i still wake up and i currently cant get a new cart for it). so what are some of your guys recommendations for falling asleep/ staying asleep?
Signal	I'm tired of seeing people act like it's the end of the world when they get just a few hours asleep, for example someone will say, they slept at 5am and woke up at 10 am and be real freaked out about it, if you get at least a few hours of sleep then you don't have it as bad as some of us do, I go through 2-3 days with NO HOURS of sleep, I have to wait until my stupid brain finally gives up and makes me pass out, during those days it's hell, dealing with blurry vision, slow coordination, seeing shadows in the corner of my vision, fatigue, lack of motivation, depression, etc...
Signal	School starts again tomorrow and haven't slept in 2 days. Every night I spend some 10h in bed only to not fall asleep at all. I take 3mg melatonin by the recommendation of my doctor and have felt no effects what so ever.Any tips to hopefully sleep tonight?
NotSignal	Ever since being played off 4 weeks ago I've gotten 3 to 4 hours a sleep. The first 2 weeks I was just tired but one Saturday I had a big panic attack felt like heart attack so I went to the ER and they just prescribed me ativan. Since the then I've been sleeping little and feeling like drunk every day has any body had a similar experience ?
Signal	I wanted to share my insomnia story from back in 2017. I’ve been meaning to do this for a while but it’s hard for me to even come on this thread because it reminds me of what I went through, but If it can help someone out there, i’ll he happy :)Basically in the fall of 2017, I graduated from college and started a full time job. Due to my negative behaviors in college and increasingly rampant anxiety, i lost the ability to sleep completely. I would only sleep for 2-4 hours a night (i would repeatedly wake up and feel anxiety) , and I wouldn’t be able to dream at all. I sought medical help (my biggest mistake tbh) and they put me on antidepressants because they said I couldn’t sleep since I was depressed. Deep down I knew I was a happy person - I was depressed because if anyone slept for 3 hours a night every night, they would be depressed too. I was also prescribed anxiety medicine and even took Seroquel and ambien for sleep, which gave me horrible nightmares. Eventually none of these things really helped me anymore and the antidepressants really affected me negatively so I went on top of a parking garage in Chicago and wanted to jump off to end my life. Luckily, someone saw me and stopped me from doing it. Over the next month, I did TONs of research on insomnia and realized that any prescription medicine and most supplements (maybe with the exception of magnesium and glycine) were actually making the problem worse. I think what we tend to forget is that as humans, we are naturally supposed to sleep! I understand that there are chemical imbalances or different hormonal problems that can contribute to insomnia, but usually it really is the cause of bad habits or lifestyle changes, even if in the moment it doesn’t seem like it.The day I started getting better was when I threw away all my medicine (insert doctors gasp) and slowly weaned off of my antidepressant. I told myself that I would be able to fix my sleep. Slowly but surely, I started dreaming again and my sleep slowly went back to normal, an hour more at a time.I just wanted to share this story because I know a lot of people are looking for an easy fix with medicine. I get it, i’ve been there and I almost killed myself. The answer is in the simple things - exercise, routine, meditation, quitting caffeine, getting off devices, checking for deficiencies, eating a healthy diet!! these are the things that in my opinion really matter. Even taking melatonin everyday is not healthy, in my own opinion.My routine that fixed my sleep-Wake up at 7 AM everyday no matter whatQuit caffeine and sugar, completelyEat brown rice salmon and avocado every day- high fat and protein Supplement with magnesium, and drink lots of water throughout the dayLimit screen time- flux and night mode when necessary Meditation Sleep around 10 every dayabsolutely no napsI hiked for 4 miles daily (thank you california).... and went to the gym every other day Talk to friends daily and stay happy and the biggest tip- DO NOT THINK ABOUT INSOMNIA ALL day! tell yourself that you don’t care how much sleep you get. If you stress out about it all day, it will bleed into night time creating a cycle. Tell yourself people have survived much worse, and that you really could not care less if you sleep or not. Repeat this to yourself mentally and really believe that you’ll make progress :) I hope this helps someone who believes in their own ability to overcome this without medications that will make the problem worse in the long run. I believe in you!
NotSignal	Sometimes I can't fall asleep at night and am up until ~5am and then by the grace of god I am able to fall asleep. I normally wake up at 8am no matter how little sleep I get, so that adds up to roughly 3 hours of sleep and sometimes less. If this isn't after multiple nights of bad sleep in a row, then I'll be a little more groggy than usual the next day but can otherwise function okay. I'd say on these days I'm functioning at 50-60% my normal capacity. However on the rare chance that I'm unable to fall asleep the night before, my next day is like 100% fucked. I'm basically functioning at 10-15% capacity and need to call off sick from work. Anyone feel this way? I feel like even a tiny bit of sleep makes a world of difference the next day in how I function. On the flip side, if I take a long nap during the day (which I normally don't) it really doesn't help at all besides fuck up my sleep schedule even more.
Signal	okay so i just started Zoloft like two months ago and i have the worst sleep patterns ever since then. like yesterday- good 3am to 12pm sleep. Solid. but totally unlike me. i’m so used to being a morning person but ever since these pills i haven’t gotten up before 12, and haven’t been able to fall asleep before AT LEAST 2. Now it’s 4am, I am wide awake, and can only blame my antidepressants- which i oh so desperately need since i feel like i’m falling into a black hole otherwise. anyway, good day. literally- it is day now.
Signal	Hey all,I’ve had sleep anxiety off and on my whole life but it hasn’t manifested quite this intensely before. A couple weeks ago I began overthinking sleep - how we are just laying there, I’m not aware of anything, vulnerable, etc. It freaked me out and then every time I would try to fall asleep my body would wake itself back up with this surge of adrenaline. It’s quite unpleasant. Things have been off and on. Some nights I get 3 hours and some I sleep more like 5-6, but it’s stressing me out. I spend the whole day worrying about sleep and being really tired but then I go to lay down and have these feelings of anxiety about sleep. I’ve tried SSRIS before for my anxiety and they really don’t sit well with me, so ideally I would like to do this without meds. I have Ativan for occasional use though. Anyways now I’m in a bit of a loop of being afraid of not sleeping because I’ll be tired but thinking those ‘scary’ thoughts before bed and then the anxiety keeps me up.Anyone relate, any advice?
Signal	I just turned 17, I have woken up at 3 am and unable to sleep for the rest of the night for 3 months in a row. Every single night. Every day for me is pain since I can't do what i want to.Insomnia ruins my confidence, my school focus, my relationships, my gym progress. At this point i can't even fucking play videogames because I can't focus on a fucking screen.And Holy shit the advice from other people is annoying, I always get something like "you probably have stress and anxiety" BITCH i have stress and anxiety from knowing I WILL NOT GET ANY SLEEP TONIGHT AND IT RUINS THE NEXT DAY.
Signal	Just got 10 pills, do they work and how should I take it? Been trying everything and nothing seems to work after crying and begging my doctor reluctantly gave me these and said no refills, don't tell them if it works because they do not want to hear it, which is totally fine I just needed something because my brain refuses to switch off and gives only really poor sleep since the last few months. Been hospitalized given high doses of antipsychotics which haven't helped much. I can't stand the daily headaches and the dizziness from the lack of sleep over such a long period of time. pls tell me this thing can actually knock me out so I can actually get even like at least one solid night.
Signal	I have been having some hard time sleeping i somehow took my first nap in a while just now.
NotSignal	its always "turn off ur phone" or "dont listen to music and just lie down." am i going crazy, or is looking at my phone for 3 minutes really gonna make me stay up for so long?
NotSignal	I'm pissed that my sleep doctor didn't tell me about this. FYI, I believe this will only work if your insomnia is purely psychological/emotional, like how mine was.First presented in the book Relax and Win by Lloyd Bud Winter, this is the method:1. Relax the muscles in your face, including tongue, jaw and the muscles around the eyes2. Drop your shoulders as far down as they’ll go, followed by your upper and lower arm, one side at a time3. Breathe out, relaxing your chest followed by your legs, starting from the thighs and working down4. You should then spend 10 seconds trying to clear your mind before thinking about one of the three following images: 1. You’re lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky above you 2. You’re lying in a black velvet hammock in a pitch-black room 3. You repeat “don’t think, don’t think, don’t think” to yourself over and overYou have to follow these steps EXACTLY and it might work for you. Of course it will not work for everyone, but for the past 3 nights I've fallen asleep in less than 10 minutes so I decided I'd share it with you all.Personally, what I noticed is that I had a lot of tension in my face when trying to fall asleep and, as silly as it sounds, this is what was preventing me from falling asleep in combination with my mind wandering to emotionally charged thoughts
Signal	I literally waste 1-3 hours every single night on my bed trying to fall asleep. I tried to wake up earlier in the morning in the hope that I would feel more tired and fall asleep easily at night. However, it never works. I just feel more agitated every night when I’m on my bed. I’m super annoyed about my insomnia and it is significantly bothering my daily life. Any similar stories and how did you guys overcome it?
Signal	I’ve developed pretty bad insomnia lately and my doctor thinks it’s from anxiety because I told him my heart and mind start racing right when I wake up after only sleeping 3-4 hours a night.Anyway he prescribed Trazodone and I looked it up and read some mixed reviews. Also I read that you are not supposed to take it under 25. But I read many success stories with minimal side effects and people who have been taking it since they were 15 so I guess I am just confused if I should try it or not. Thanks for the feedback
Signal	What do you all do when you can't sleep? Not looking for the relaxing answers; I've already tried reading, meditation, etc. I've given up at this point for tonight, and just want to enjoy the extra hours I have tonight.
NotSignal	Let alone the fact that I haven't slept for nearly 4 days, and I feel unmotivated. desperately try to keep my hobbies, so I try to cook( mind you, at 2 am) I wanna make a ground pork taco. While my leat was cooking I whipped batch of home made tortillas. I must have fucked something up or I do t know but it turned out really bad. It didn't put enough of something in there, or something because as I tried to cook it, but it crisped up fell apart, and now I. Here eating ground pork like cereal
NotSignal	so my insomnia is due to my neighbors upstairs having hardwood floors(i live in a condo). anyway i spoke with them already twice and while they try to keep the noise down, it is still extremely loud, especially at night and in the morning(specifically their shoes).&#x200B;is there any product out there that will completely block out noise? right now i use earplugs with a little vaseline, roll them into a pin and stick them in my ear canal. this does help block out low frequency sounds like a pillow falling on the floor or walking barefoot however it does not help with high frequency sounds like the hard heel of a shoe. i also use a noise machine that help a little. what REALLY helps is when i use my sony noise cancelling headphones(sony wh-1000mx3) with the earplugs. it is dead quiet the problem is i am a side sleeper so it wont work for actual sleep.&#x200B;does anyone have any recommendations? are there any 'noiseless sleep bands' on the market? all of the noiseles sleep bands ive seen just play sounds/podcasts but dont actually do any kind of noise cancellation.
Signal	hey guys! im a medical student who has suffered a pretty bad bout of insomnia this year due to a build of anxiety and stress. i had a terrible sleep schedule during lock down, sleeping very late. all of a sudden, i was put into a new town (for clinical placements) which required me to sleep early and wake up early and this is when it began. there was a lot of noise disruption in the beginning (a loose vent which made a constant and loud tapping noise, noisy flatmates) but even when those things managed to get fixed, i still had a negative and anxious association to the place where i slept. on top of that, i felt a lot of pressure and performance anxiety as a new medical student on the wards and almost felt like i didn’t deserve to sleep due to the competitiveness around me. i was getting one to two hours a night, for several weeks now, and it got really bad to a point where i didn’t sleep two days in a row. i never had trouble sleeping like this in the past, sure i pulled all-nighters to study and i had my anxious periods, but i always bounced back and it never caused insomnia like this. i tried moving back home but that didn’t work because by then the anxiety has spiralled on itself, i was anxious about falling asleep, the anxiety kept me up and alert on fight or flight mode, then the lack of sleep made me more anxious about how i would perform the next day and everything felt out of control. at this point i had tried a number of different medications that worked for the first day but stopped after then. zopiclone, benzos, quetiapine and promethazine. i noticed a slight improvement with quetiapine though, it helped me fall asleep but i kept waking up every 1.5 hours. same with promethazine. so i decided to try 25mg quetiapine and 25mg promethazine together. it worked wonders. around this time i also saw a counsellor which helped me with some sleep hygiene advice (winding down routines and sleeping at the same time and no more late nights). it was stuff i already knew but it helped reinforce the habits. i haven’t relapsed back into that horrible insomnia period since. i really think this combination of meds, in combination with some adjustments to my sleep hygiene made a world of a difference. i hope i can wean of the meds one day but so far i haven’t felt any dependence so am happy to keep taking them. hope this helps someone out there
NotSignal	I wake up at 4:30am about 2-3 times a week. Usually fall asleep 12-1 am. I am *not* asking for advice for how to sleep. I do *not* need tips for how to sleep, there are plenty of places for me to find that information. I’ve tried:ExerciseBlue blocking glasses Staying out of bed until I’m ready to sleepMelatonin, valerian, BenadrylEar plugs, eye maskKeeping the room cool, letting it get too hot. Drinking alcohol - this helps me fall asleep but I wake up at 4 am more oftenAbstaining from alcohol - this makes it harder to sleep but I get more restful sleep; but still only a few hours. Anyway I went to a sleep doctor and he said I may have sleep apnea, judging from the fact that I have a large tongue to mouth ratio and that my girlfriend occasionally hears me snoring, and when I do sleep I still feel tired. In the past I have woken up gasping for air, maybe a few times a year if I’m truly exhausted. My girlfriend who I sleep with every night says she has never noticed this, and that I snore maybe once a month. My questions are:1. Has anyone in this sub been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and if so did treatment help?2. Could sleep apnea cause me to wake up at 4 am and not be able to fall back asleep? Or make it difficult to sleep until 12-1 am? It almost seems like sleep apnea would cause the opposite to happen. Anyway I went in hoping for some meds to take once in awhile when my insomnia gets unbearable, but if I have a treatable disease, even better.
NotSignal	When i sometimes start finally falling a sleep i start to see weird shit in a dream/hallucination (i cannot confirm really) that interrupts my sleep. Some of the shit i see is easy to describe like man with a crooked neck or a really really really tall woman that is staring at me but some of them are weird as fuck. The stuff my wild imagination creates dont really scares me but i hate the fact that it interrupts my process of falling asleep anyone here is expericing weird stuff like that?
NotSignal	These days I have to wake up and poop because have a colon problem and can only poop... diarrhoea... so then THAT woke me up at midnight or at an abnormal time so I have to take another zz pill... I hate it when that happens.
Signal	I'll be so tired from not sleeping I'll fall asleep anywhere and when I do even for a minute my whole night is ruined. Anyone know why this is and how to stop it?

I did a home sleep.study in February 2020 and that said mild sleep.apnea but was told they are only 60 percent acurate and arent as accurate as over night. I did have 2 sleep study done end of 2018 9 months before symptoms kicked in any they suggested severe sleep apnea. It just seems odd once i toke antidepressants this sleep deprivation kicked in rapidly. The rapid weight loss drove me to think prion disease since i have no other health condition and i did have a cut off of 10 kg in a 3 month time span.
NotSignal	I'm a 20 year old college student who typically sleeps at 2. I drank some coffee with my family today and now I'm awake at 3:56. I'm going to sleep at 11pm from now on and remove caffeine from my diet.
NotSignal	For the past month and a half I've been consistently doing my morning prayers at around 3:30am and going to bed at 5-6am and getting 7-8 hours of sleep no problem.But recently I've stopped praying and tried fixing sleep schedule, and have been going to bed at 1-2am but keep waking up at 3-6am for the past 4 days.Would it be possible that my brains waking up because it's so used to waking up to pray? And if it is, how long does it take for it to stop getting used to that?
Signal	I woke up around 7:30 this morning and didn’t nap or anything and Idk how I still can’t fall sleep. Usually I only have problems if I take a nap or something. But I’m still wide awake at 1am. Any tips what to do? I don’t have anymore Benadryl left so I can’t take that 🙃
NotSignal	I don’t get what’s wrong with me. Most people’s bodies give out by now. I have not had any caffeine any time recently, been lying in bed trying to sleep. Have barely slept for the past several weeks, yet don’t feel tired, though I clearly am, because I’m starting to get muscle twitches all over and stuff.
NotSignal	I fell asleep a few times but every time I fell asleep I would have a dream where I would like trip or fall, making me actually move my legs, or it would give me adrenaline therefore waking me up.And other times I would just wake up for no reason.I am very hot now so it's very hard to try and sleep again, I sleep with a fan at my house so I'm used to sleeping in the cold, I have a pretty big day tomorrow though so hopefully I'm not just tired all day. Y'all got any tips to keep me from being drowsy?Not sure if this counts as insomnia, or if it fits the sub, but whatever.
NotSignal	Does anyone else feel pressure after getting a rare good night of sleep to accomplish all of your plans now that you aren’t constantly tired?
Signal	You know, I half expected getting like this, but it's still just fucking soul crushing. It's just amazing that my body is gonna jeopardise this for me. Thanks to covid its taken nearly a whole year to get to this stage, and now that I'm finally here my inability to fucking sleep is gonna ruin it.Idk whether I'm mad, sad, hopeless or indifferent. Idk whether to keep trying at sleep for an hour or two or too give up. Idk if any of it makes a fucking difference.Actually just fuck this.
Signal	I have very odd, almost paranoid tendencies about sleeping that has only fed into my chronic insomnia. I refuse to take sleeping pills, but any advice is welcome on how to improve my sleeping. Enjoy my weird sleep requirements. In order to properly sleep, the room must be very cold, around 60°F, with only one light blanket on me and one pillow on the bed. The bed must be up against two walls, with no windows or doors near me. The door must be shut and barricaded by a heavy object, if there is no lock on the door. My back must be facing the wall, and I sleep with a pocketknife beneath the pillow. I am completely unable to sleep in new rooms or with people in the same room or bed as me. I will frequently stay awake for two day periods to adjust to new surroundings and make sure they are safe enough to sleep in. Any noise or light is enough to wake me up or prevent me from sleeping. I follow a schedule of six in the morning to nine in the morning. Melatonin and over the counter sleep aids do little to help me sleep. At times, I’ve had hallucinations from lack of sleep while I adjust to new rooms. I have never been able to nap, nor can I sleep in anything other than a bed.
Signal	Im scared. I have insomnia that isnt that bad. I think the first month of quarantine I averaged 5-6 hours of sleep and some nights none. Now I have been getting great sleep 7-8 but still very little some nights. &#x200B;So I was wondering if I could "catch up". I feel like the inconsistent nature of my sleep is to the point where it'll be impossible to catch up to those nights that I got no sleep at all. And there are many.&#x200B;Also, the biggest thing I want an answer to is if it is possible to develop a good sleep schedule to fix certain problems. This is the thing. I have a feeling that my lack of sleep some nights is what feeds many issues I'm currently facing as an 18 year old, such as depersonalization/derealization, anxiety, etc. I was given Buspar to fight off anxiety. But Im just wondering, if these problems are truly caused by my lack of sleep and unhealthy habits, if it is still possible to get rid of them through quality sleep and healthy habits. At this point I think its impossible to catch up on hours because I'm in the negative (hours lost from those nights), but I'm wondering if i can still get rid of these mental problems even after those sleepless nights.&#x200B;Love you guys. It means the world.
NotSignal	Does Sonata get you high? I’m about to take it for the first time! And does it work well for getting you tired?
NotSignal	I’m young, 22. However, there are some nights I’m very scared to sleep. Lately my anxiety has been through the roof. It doesn’t help especially now that I’ve lost a lot of “good friends”. It might sound silly or whatever, but, I’m scared if I fall asleep, I might not wake up. This doesn’t happen all the time but, sometimes it just happens. I’ve heard that you can have a stroke in your sleep, and ever since some famous Disney child passed away from it, it’s got me thinking. Especially since he was about my age and I grew up watching his show. Regardless of the stroke, some nights it’s just incredibly hard for me to sleep. My mind just wanders everywhere. It doesn’t really help now that we’re dealing with the situation we’re in today. Anyways, anyone ever feel like this? I tend to just go on my phone and watch a show for a few hours or search up careers but, I was wondering how do you cope with it, if you are out there experiencing this. **Also, please don’t tell me to seek help.** Ive already talked to a few friends about the issue and when I do, it calms me down, but then when I wake up in the middle of the night and I’m the only one awake, it kind of gets the nerves going. Like I said before, my mind just wanders.
NotSignal	So you know when you should be in bed and trying to fall asleep but are failing to do so and procrastinating on it? Currently me right now, my roommate is suggesting I go to bed but I'm like shhhh. Also kinda crossfaded.
NotSignal	It’s the same mattress, just different bed frame, yet everything feels so uncomfortable. My thoughts are running wild. Why is this happening :((
Signal	Throwaway account because this is embarrassing. Alright. It’s 7am and I’m just upset and scared now. I just tried closing my eyes and laying down but it isn’t working. For years now I’ve found that I simply cannot sleep unless I jerk myself to sleep. Maybe I have a masturbation problem? I’m not sure. Thing is I’m an adult now and this needs to be taken care of. I’m very scared that if this doesn’t stop I’ll end up with erectile dysfunction or something worse. I can’t even do it right now because my sack is completely empty which also worries me greatly. This really isn’t a joke or anything, I just very badly need some advice. This will affect my sex life and sleep schedule so it has to be fixed. It has to. I will answer any question in the comments. Please help? How do I force myself to sleep? Some sort of pills? Another solution?
Signal	My entire life I have had a very hard time sleeping at night. I have always been tired during the day and wide awake at night. When I was younger I often hung out with friends and boyfriends late at night because that was when I felt the most normal. I never had any testing done because it wasn’t that bad until about two years ago. A 24 hour cortisol test revealed that my cortisol pattern is that of someone who works night shifts. It’s way too low during the day and is too high in the evening. My attempts to try and fix my sleep issues have continually failed me. I either toss and turn all night or I sleep through the night and feel like I got hit by a truck with a terrible hangover feeling the next day.. my body hates sleeping at night and I just can’t fix this cycle. As it has worsened the past few years my health has really declined and I’m at a loss for how to sleep at night. I’ve tried melatonin and I find it makes me feel too groggy the next day. If anyone else has this and if you found anything that helps let me know. I’m sure this is probably some kind of sleep disorder but I don’t know what it is.
NotSignal	And the majority of the time when I was sleeping it was light. Oof. No wonder I never feel rested even when I do sleep! I'm not sure how accurate Fitbits are for sleep detection... but it's not surprising if true, I'm a mess lol.
Signal	I’m awake from 7pm to 11am. I sleep from 12pm to 6pm. Basically I miss the whole day and being awake at night offers nothing productive. I just can’t fall sleep and it’s so frustrating.
NotSignal	my peers often complain about getting “like no sleep last night” only to reveal that they got like 5 whole hours. they often use this as an excuse for things, and sometimes it is the reason they are taking a sick day. i do not like to talk about my sleep issues often, but sometimes i get fed up with people like this. when they act like they are having a hard time, i sometimes will reveal that the night before was a sleepless night (as it often is), and they will just reply with, “but you do that all the time! so you’re fine you’re used to it. i just cannot function today.” which makes me feel so misunderstood. i wish they could feel the discomfort and mental obstacles i experience nearly every day.
NotSignal	I cant sleep. My moms a nurse, i thought hey maybe she has some melatonin. Nope none. I found some fish oil and b vitamin, and 11 different brands of stool softener.My mom doesnt eat though. She just takes stool softener. Im worried about her. Should i explain to her that if she wants to poop she has to eat too not just take stool softener. Shes a nurse for crying out loud did they not teacher her how the digestive system works in school?
NotSignal	I’m 26 now but I’ve had this problem for YEARS. When I was in the third grade on a school night, I read Charlie and the chocolate factory in one night from beginning to end. I don’t want to take sleeping pills because I’m afraid of getting addicted or something. Do melatonin drops work for you guys? Has anyone tried ANY remedies that worked for them?
Signal	Been having therapy for anxiety, thought I was making some improvements until works started to get stressful again. Woke at 2am started having an anxiety attack; head spinning full of thoughts about what I've got to do at work and the fact I've just finished my therapy and worrying I've made no progress; amongst other thoughts going through my head. Got in a right state, but does anyone else have the same issue, when you talk about it the next day; all your worries and 2am panics don't seem half as bad and you struggle to explain or validate the panic you were going through all the previous night.
Signal	Insomniacs of reddit,I’ve been on 7.5mg zopiclone (prescribed) for about 3 years now after having no sleeping aids, except for melatonin, since I was diagnosed with primary idiopathic insomnia when I was 9 and it’s been blissful (minus the horrendous taste in my mouth the next day, but so worth it). The problem is that it’s very easy to develop a tolerance and as the 1-2 times a week I use it tend to be the only full nights of sleep that I get, I’m starting to consider alternatives. I tried using ambiguous doses of Valium and Xanax (not prescribed) as sleep aids for a while and, while great for mellowing you out before bed, they don’t have the same sleep-inducing effect. Has anyone tried cycling benzos with non-benzos? Did you develop the same tolerance as you would have if just using one of them? My tolerance has previously gotten to 15mg (tends to happen around exams) which isn’t a place I want to be in as these drugs are an absolute saving grace, so don’t want them to become ineffective but also need to sleep more.
Signal	Hi everyone. I have been struggling with chronic insomnia on and off for several years. I have noticed my day to day functioning significantly worsen when I've been sleep deprived (2-4 hours of sleep) for more than a few weeks, and over time, months or years. I almost feel like I'm slightly drunk all the time, am much worse at interacting normally in social situations, and do work/read etc extremely slowly, which makes me look bad at work. Can anyone else relate? How do you notice sleep deprivation over a long period of time impacting you?
NotSignal	Not sure where to turn. Clearly not about insomnia but idk what else to make of this. Mods please delete if not allowed. Just need an opinion. For those of you with glasses, did the vision problems gradually become apparent or did it happen very suddenly? I’ve been having vision issues unrelated to insomnia. I’ve been sleeping fairly well these past few days if I’m honest. Hope you all get some rest tonight.
NotSignal	Not necessarily something to help you fall asleep but what do you do to help you not worry about not sleeping? Like if you're up all night, how do you keep your anxiety about missing sleep down?
NotSignal	My insomnia issues started back in middle school. Back then I’d sometimes find relief by going downstairs and sleeping on the couch, or weirdly enough, even on the floor on a bunch of blankets. To this day, going out on the couch in the living room often helps me sleep, sometimes instantaneously. Anyone else like this? I was seeing a sleep therapist for a while and got to a point where I was like, happy going to sleep in my room (well, my husbands and my room- I basically kicked him out 😅) but for some reason now I’m back to (almost) square one.
NotSignal	Does this happen to anyone else? Sometimes before I can fall into a deeper sleep I just fall asleep and immediately dream for like 10 min or so and then wake right back up. This happens a few times sometimes before I actually fall asleep, and this has definitely been worse since quarantine.
Signal	I've read some of you trying cbti as well a couple of months ago. Any progress? I'm so sleep deprived, the thought of continuing to live like this causes me major despair. I experienced intense period of insomnia last year about 18 months ago after coming off my antidepressants. It left me traumatised but i managed to start sleeping normally again after a brief go at sleep restriction for maybe 2-3 weeks. I never stuck to the short window and got back to 8 hrs per night. The problem is i never overcame the fear of it happening again and guess what- it snuck up on me again!So here i am, swearing that this time, i will overcome any fears of not sleeping and accept the process to stay on track for good. Cbti is exposure therapy for sure and repeated exposure i thought would deflate the fear- but im struggling big time.Ad the days go by, I'm getting more aroused at bedtime as i dread another tough night and day. Staying up later is def causing more anxiety. My old sleep pattern was to crash early, like 8.30pm. Now staying up so much later is really messing with me. I go to bed and i am wide awake, not some nights like before. I know its early days, I'm on day 8 but I'm at breaking point. I can't focus, calling on sick to work, feeling numb and despondent. I need to hear of someone's success!!
Signal	The past few month, I’ve been really struggling with sleeping. I came across the term “Circadian Sleep Disorder” which I think I have. I literally cannot sleep until past 4am and when I do fall asleep I always wake up in the middle of it to use the bathroom even though I have been extremely mindful of my fluid and caffeine intake at night and during the day (nocturia as well?). Even when my sleep schedule was a little better, I ALWAYS woke up a 2+ times during the night to wake up and pee.I hadn’t realized this until kind of recently, but I think I’m depressed now and have been for awhile. My level of irritability is at an all time high, I’m always tired and unmotivated, can’t focus, and always angry. Like if insomnia was a person, I might be in jail or prison I just don’t know what to do anymore and I’m just so sad, angry, and tired all the time. I just really need help but I don’t think there is any help or cure out which makes all of this even more depressing. Like I’m soooooo desperate to just get solid sleep for once in my life. I’m just really sad
NotSignal	i have waged war on the ants that live in my walls at 5 in the morning with elmers glue&#x200B;why am i like this
Signal	I can’t sleep or course, I haven’t slept without overdosing or alcohol in months, not a wink, so being over my friends house is such a pain. I don’t want to wake them, but I don’t want to be sat up, alone. It’s the afternoon, they still haven’t woken up and it feels like one continuous, never-ending day. I’m bored and alone, so exhausted but sleep obviously doesn’t happen.Even when they stay awake all night and through the early morning, they then proceed to sleep all day, they don’t have insomnia thank god, just messed up sleep schedules. I’d do anything to be sleeping like them, comfortable and warm, but it’s impossible, so I’m awake, alone, stressed and unbelievably bored.I would never want to disrupt their sleep though.
NotSignal	I'm pretty sure the title says it all. Lately, I've been having the weirdest case of insomnia. Most of the time, I'm staying up pretty late; latest would be up to 5 or 6 am. Pretty bad for my health, ngl, and I'm trying to fix it by going to bed MUCH earlier. Possibly around 10 or 11.And that's when the problem starts.Whenever I try to go to bed early, I somehow manage to wake up 3 hours later. Either because I'm too thirsty, need to head to the bathroom, or that my room is too hot; for some reason, I can't go back to bed without feeling groggy in the morning. And most of that time I'm doing it, I can't fall asleep. It's like my body's forcibly controlling itself when my mind's telling me to stop. It's 10:44 am from where I'm from (woke up at around and haven't fallen asleep since) and I'm trying to get back to sleep in a before the alarm blares in an hour. During which, anyone dealing with this issue? And any solutions?
NotSignal	I've noticed that I get my best quality sleep after 4am usually. Anyone else notice this? It's not necessarily the best quality, but the best I can do. Everything before that is collecting naps. I usually wake up around 0545-0600, so that's a crap realisation.
NotSignal	Whenever I try to go to bed, I have this intense feeling that someone is going to break into my room, which I know is totally irrational, but it makes it really hard to go to bed.Another thing that keeps me up is the thought of my blankets falling off of the side of my bed.Due to these, I usually go to sleep in my basement because I don't have any of these fears and I'm able to go to bed but sleeping on a cement basement floor is not good for my back so I don't know what to do.
NotSignal	This is what helped me.1. Stopped all the pills2. Went on with my day no matter how much I sleep3 Believed in the fact that my brain will stabilize itself over time.4. Had a mentality of enjoying my day no matter no matter how much sleep I get.After some time you will realize that your sleep got 1 % better. That 1 % will increase the sleep confidence and your will go on an incline. Your anxiety will decrease since you will know that life still goes on even with little sleep.Good luck fellas.
Signal	This is so unusual to me!! I am exhausted but waking up every 40 mins or 30 mins. I do have sore throat and on and off headaches, got tested for flu and corona few days ago. Idk if it’s symptom of the virus or what’s going on. Getting pretty worried. I woke up like 5 times the past two hours. The whole night I probably woke up 10 times or so. I wake up completely awake like I slept the whole night. So weird!! Idk if it’s just stress or a virus. Anyone else having this???
NotSignal	I go to bed at 11:00pm and every night I wake up some time between 2-5a and am up for a couple hours and finally fall back asleep for another hour or so. I don’t drink any caffeine and am a healthy female in her 30s. What can I do??
Signal	So today is my birthday and it’s nearly 2am, but I’m sadly still awake. All my friends and family are asleep. I’m just sitting here waiting and waiting to fall asleep, and it makes me feel very alone and sad, which is no way to feel ever, let alone on your birthday. Well, here’s to another year that my insomnia hasn’t been cured.
Signal	So, I have this thing where I won’t sleep properly for several days, then I’ll be so exhausted that I crash and don’t get out of bed for ~12 hours. Then, I’m too refreshed and well-rested to fall asleep properly for several days, and the cycle begins again. This can go on for months. I’ve tried to establish a more regular sleep schedule and get into/out of bed at the same time, but sleep deprivation eventually leaves me physically ill and I can’t stop the crash. I try to avoid sleeping for too long during a crash to avoid the overly-refreshed thing, but alarms fail wake me up and I lack the motivation to get up. Any strategies for how to ‘break out’ of the cycle or reset my sleep schedule would be greatly appreciated!
Signal	Off and on for the past 6 months or so I’ve had problems with going to sleep. Basically when I start to fall asleep, it feels like my lungs relax faster than my brain does which causes my brain to send a signal to wake up cause it thinks I’m not breathing when I myself know I’m still breathing. This cycle goes on over and over again till my body just gives out from exhaustion. I take 300 mg of magnesium at night, I eat clean I workout 5 days a week don’t smoke or drink. I’ve tried melatonin literally nothing works and it’s so frustrating. I had a sleep study done and I don’t have sleep apnea so it’s not that. Does anyone have a similar sort of experience? If so have you found anything that helps? Thank you
NotSignal	Why or why not? I’m thinking about seeing a sleep doctor to determine why some nights I have insomnia and I wanted to know whether it has to do with quitting benzo, my bipolar disorder or the medications or stress itself.
Signal	So I’m a stubborn af med student struggling with insomnia for the past month or so which really screws with my ability to do med stuff so you know what I’m gonna do? Imma beat insomnia at its own game- I’m gonna get so tired that it HAS to give way. How will I do this? Staying up for 36 hrs and going to the gym twice. Wish me luck
NotSignal	Just curious I know some of you are parents out there. What do you do to get through a day of extreme exhaustion when you are caring for a young child ? Before I had my child I would go to work and just fake it but for me being a parent it's hard to do that with him. I barely got 3 hours last night. I'm exhausted and hes extremely active and curious.
NotSignal	Hello everyone, I have been having an extremely hard time sleeping since the beginning of april during the auarantine. Many days i would wake up way too early agter 3 to 4 hours of sleep and sometimes i would just fall asleep super late and wake up after only a few hours of sleep aswell. A lot of days I would also go without sleep at all til the next night to attempt sleeping again. Im back to work for about two weeks now and today i havent gone to work because i just couldnt im way too tired. My boss asked me to give him a answer til tomorrow evening if I can still work in my condition.The thing is, my job is a part time before uni and I already saved up enough. But Im still wondering if I should leave in order to give myself time to deal with this issue or should Is still keep the job.I dont know why it all started, I have been working out for more than two years. I eat very healthy and have low bosyfat. I get sunlight early in the morning but as soon as I get to bed my heart starts racing and Im restless.
Signal	I've been trying to fall asleep for a while now but I feel angry at myself for getting in my head about it which causes me further frustration. On top of things it's very hot in the room and I can't seem to find a comfortable position.
NotSignal	I hate this disorder or disease or whatever you want to call it with a burning passion! Here I am wide awake at 5:00 AM when I have a conference in 3 hours and I simply can’t sleep. My meds either make me oversleep or undersleep and my insomnia leads to migraines which create an endless loop of pain and no sleep and mind it i’m only 14 years old. Anyone have any suggestions to beating this?
NotSignal	I slept 1 he last night. Scary stuff has happened to my family and of course my body/mind can’t handle it. I feel weak, shaky, sweaty and my mind is an over inflated balloon ready to burst in the air. 50% of the words coming out of my mouth today is “I’m so sorry”. I’m not eve here, I’ve dissociated just so my meat bag of a body can keep moving. I’m finally on lunch and I’ve been sobbing for 30 minutes. I have an appointment with my psychiatric nurse practitioner tomorrow, I just have to make it a few more hours, just one day...
Signal	So I’m due to start diazepam which usually helps for sleep on Monday/Tuesday. Zopiclone 7.5mg isn’t working for me and I’ve been advised to up till 15 until then. I’m really really anxious. I don’t want to take 15mg. It doesn’t make me sleepy just tired, and gives me ocd to keep repeating and checking when I take it. Anybody else get the ocd. This is stressing me out so much. I’m even being told that if diezapam doesn’t get approved I’ll be out on low dose quietapine and I’m so anxious I could cry. I refuse to go on an anti psychotic because depression wise I’m fine and anxiety is only bad when I can’t sleep, - ocd also good without the fucking zopiclone.
NotSignal	3, 5 , 4 and tonight 1.5 hours sleep. God I am losing my mind tonight. Hope some of you out there are getting few hours. Hz
NotSignal	The past 2 weeks ive been constantly feeling dizzy. I wouldn't say it's extreeme to the point where i am not able to walk straight, but i'd describe it as ''when you drink a 1-2 cups of alcohol and you get a little bit tipsy, to the point where you don't feel your nose well, but you understand whats happening and you have control over yourself''. (weird comparison, i know, but its the one that explains the situation best).I wouldn't mind it if i were on vacation, but i have work to do and this doesn't help me focus at all. I'm used to sleeping for a short period of time everyday, but i've never been dizzyIs this normal for other people too? Or is it definetly weird and i should check it out?
NotSignal	I just listened to the old owl city song Firefly. Man, that dude had legit insomnia and turned it into cheerful sounding music. I don't know how I missed that when I heard the song back when it was released.
NotSignal	Not sure if this is the right place to share. It might be some medical issue or something but whatever. My sleep is constantly getting interrupted by my salivary glands. It sounds weird, but I’ll try to sleep and saliva will get produced under my tongue and make it float around as if it were a boat on a sea of spit. It’s incredibly hard to ignore, and if I choose not to ignore it, I can’t focus on sleep at all because I’m swallowing all of my spit. Is this normal and do people just ignore it and am I going crazy? Not sure.
NotSignal	Hi guys please help, I am looking to start cbd oil and looking to see any personal expiernces from people on here, please let me know if it helped you, helped a friend. I really wanna start it to see if it does improve my sleep and anxiety. All the best happy sleeping all
Signal	New to this sub, but not reddit, so I appreciate any insight. I have severe insomnia and have not slept the last 6 nights. I’m NOT suicidal, but Idk how I’m alive tbh. Also, I am NOT a drug abuser - I do have severe anxiety and chronic pain though. I made a personal decision to quit pain mgmt and oxycodone on my own accord in January 2017. I found kratom, which I used until November 30, 2019 to fight my chronic pain, anxiety, and chronic eppstein barr virus. I quit for financial reasons, and I don’t like being reliant on a substance, even if it’s a plant.Since then, I’ve been treated by an addiction doc (the doc who also did pain mgmt following back surgery late 2016). He was incredibly non-judgmental - said def not the first lawyer to become hooked on kratomzHe prescribed suboxone 4 mg tapered down to .5 mg for three weeks, .5 mg clonodine once a day, and 2 mg valium the last three nights of my taper.I slept fine on the meds, but once I was done the insomnia set in. A psych then prescribed gabapentin and seroquel (parents forced me to see a psych, who was actually just a nurse practicioner, after learning about my kratom addicition/dependency), but they caused me some weird episodes so I quit on my own after about a month because of the potential for dependency and weight gain (I’m an elite distance runner). Initially I had severe itching, which was attributed to seroquel withdrawal (NEVER take an antipsychotic if you are not psychotic). Then I developed severe insomnia. I’ve never been a good sleeper, but now it’s been insane. 5-6 nights with NO sleep. I’ve tried melatonin, chamomile tea, benadryl, and advil pm. I even visited the highest rated psych in my area, who prescribed me 1 mg ativan 2x/day.At first the ativan helped, then it completely stopped working. In the past, it’s been a wonder drug, helping my anxiety, insomnia, and post-cholesysectomy issues. Then it stopped. Got some weed, then CBD, from my BF but that is not a long term solution for menow.I guess my question is does anyone have any advice of any kind? I feel like my body is breaking down from lack of sleep and NO ONE gets it. I can’t run like normal, and everything hurts. I’m like a fish out of water flopping around all night. I’m waiting to see if my doctor will temporarily up my ativan rx, but long term I don’t want to rely on any controlled substance.Thanks in advance for any tips!
NotSignal	Had a vivid nightmare and woke up ... managed to put it out of my mind, and then I had another 2 vivid nightmares that felt like forever. Now it’s 2:30 AM and my mind is wide awake. I haven’t been able to get quality sleep more than 2 hours a night for 5 months, and now when I finally relax and fall asleep it’s nothing but unrefreshing nightmares...
NotSignal	Lol I’ve stayed up so long all my nearsighted is blurry! I think these words are typed correctly but idk. I slept two hours yesterday and nine today. I think it’s tomorrow now technically. My sleep study came back with weird results but the leads kept coming off throughout the nights, so who knows. Anyhow this is super weird to me. I am not able to fall asleep and I want to go for a walk to get my brain out of a loop. I don’t recall having vision effected by not sleeping before, though, and I’ve never had a healthy sleep physiology. Not concerned as much as it’s like. “Oh hey that’s new”
Signal	When you close your eyes and start to sleep but it's taking too long so u get mad and lose it
NotSignal	Like I don’t know. Where you have to shake off the energy or something. Just work up to this right now in the middle of the night. Like I have the urge to just shake it out somehow just to alleviate the sensations. I have to roll around in bed. The only thing that comes up when I search google is restless leg syndrome but idk if that’s right at all.
NotSignal	i find myself dozing off when its 5 am(when im completely unable to think about anything), or when i have rly positive mood and 0 thoughts(almost never during quarantene)..&#x200B;HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPP&#x200B;how do people sleep during this bullshit of a virus
Signal	I have struggled for years with anxiety that only occurs at night which has created a significant amount of insomnia. It is only with big events planned the following day. I have tried ambien, and restoril. I feel terrible the next day when trying having to use these drugs. I have been seeing a counselor for years and just come to the conclusion that it will be with me for life. Anyone use CBD oil for this type of situation?? If so what brand??Thanks!
NotSignal	Couple more days and I'll have had a full night's rest!! Kill me.3 Klonopins, 2 unisom, and crying for hours and all I got was another 2 hours.My SO swears if I would just stop thinking about it, I would sleep. If I would just work as hard as he does all day, I'd just fall asleep. It's all my fault and I should just go to sleep he says. Not says...yells. He yells it. As I'm crying. Having a panic attack.
Signal	I’ve been on trazodone since New Year’s, and have taken Xanax occasionally during that time as well. I am becoming concerned about cognitive side effects like short-term memory loss though. I started taking omega-3 to help with natural GABA production. I’ve also been drinking kombucha to increase serotonin levels.It wasn’t the greatest sleep of my life, but I slept from around 11 to 5 last night. The dreams were strange, but I’m feeling pretty good today and I think this is a good step in the right direction.
Signal	Came here to get some insight. I haven't been able to fall asleep before 5 am for the last 5 days. Then I'm up at 8-9 for work. I dont get it, I keep thinking "tonight's the night ill knock out by 10 because I only got 3 hours of sleep last night" but every night its the same story. My body is starting to hurt. Am I over exaggerating? Because I see there are people that literally don't sleep for days on end, whereas I'm still getting 3-4 hours a night. But everyday I feel worse and worse. I don't even feel like myself anymore, I used to sleep a consistent 6-7 hours a night and always felt refreshed. I'd fall asleep by midnight and be up by 7 latest, and that's without an alarm. I dont even know if I'm making any sense right now, or if I'm rambling. I also haven't tried anything to help other than benadryl, which kicks in after 2 or 3 hours, but I don't want to become reliant on benadryl. Anyway, I guess my point is: do I have insomnia, should I see a doctor? Or is this just a phase?
Signal	Its so frustrating. Im a 21 year old fit student, my life is better than ever, i am happy and even though i currently have exams it isnt super stressfull at all. I have time for friends and hobbies etc...I eat well and turn off screens an hour befote sleeping, my room is cool, quiet and dark. I never drink coffee etc...But still i rarely have a perfect sleep and just recently i cant sleep anymore. Like i lay in bed awake until the sun goes up. It has been like that on my final school exam and every university exam period befor this one so i would assume its stress...But I dont do much currently. Like 4-5 hours learning a day maximum, 1 hour guitar, 1 hour sports. Rest is just wasting time on reddit or meeting friends or my girlfriend. I feel like im going crazy. Why cant i sleep, there is no reason. I dont know what to do my head hurts so bad right now
NotSignal	I have work in the next hour and have been in bed for 7 hours trying to sleep. My left eye hurts when in blink.
NotSignal	I've been sleeping for the past couple weeks and waking up feeling like I haven't slept at all. It's just driving me crazy and I hate it. I haven't been taking anything for it due to having a doctor tell me that I can't take them if I have low blood pressure. I thought a diffuser would help me sleep but it hasn't. I just feel so tired and dead. I feel like I'm going to die early because of it and my hair being itchy as fuck isn't helping with this situation. I don't know why but sometimes when I don't sleep I get really itchy all over my body.
NotSignal	I see a lot of people talking about the pills they are taking or the herbal remedies, or products being used to battle insomnia. While it is certainly easy and quicker to take one pill and solve a problem. The downside is often times the solution to anything in life is not as simple as pop pill - problem solved. This definitely applies to sleep and insomnia. As science is readily able to prove significant detrimental effects of sleeping pills. And while natural remedies can provide solace and perhaps a few nights of restful sleep many insomniacs report that those same remedies do not provide lasting benefits. There is a more long term solution that can give you control of your sleep in any situation at any time. This solution is often times rejected because it takes time. And while it produces greater results than a pill it doesn't come as quick as a pill. But this solution is so effective because it doesn't seek to put a band-aid on the insomnia problem it actually solves the problem from the very root. What is the root? Outside of those medically diagnosed with a chemical imbalance causing insomnia, the majority of cases for insomnia are caused by a cocktail of bad habits. And the more and more that you sip from this cocktail of bad habits the more and more that the body - and especially the brain - are trained to fall into poor sleep practice. The good news is this means that for the majority restful sleep can be ACHIEVED. With a rewiring of the body and brain through sleep promoting habits you can earn your sleep back. Like I said this is not often the first approach to dealing with insomnia because it takes time and commitment. But when you do give yourself the time to adjust into good sleep hygiene the payoff far exceeds the pain of the process. So what exactly are good sleep habits? There are a number and usually it depends on your specific case. But there are 4 core sleep habits that near universally apply to getting excellent sleep. Let's talk about the core 4: 1. Caffeine - if you are a caffeine drinker (or eater) - nearly everyone is whether you know it or not - and you can master this one you will likely notice a marked improvement in your sleep. A good habit to implement here is to remove caffeine consumption after 2pm. Create a routine around when and how you consume caffeine. I.E. Make your mornings your time for embracing caffeine and enjoy it then and train your brain that mornings are the only time for caffeine. 2. Alcohol - limit alcohol consumption to 4 hours before bed time. This is heavily dependent on your BAC (blood alcohol content) and how your body reacts to alcohol. But if you are using alcohol to get to sleep then you are greatly reducing your ability to get restful sleep. Alcohol limits REM sleep. Happy hour is in fact one of the best times to enjoy alcohol. So keep your sleep happy and keep your alcohol to its proper time. 3. Schedule - having a sleep schedule is the number one way to train your brain when and how to sleep. Set a go-to-sleep and wake-up time in stone. If you don’t fall asleep within 20 minutes - get out of bed. Even if you have no or little sleep wake up consistently at the same time every day. Eventually your body and brain will fall into the rhythm you set. The hard part is having the willpower to follow through with actually waking up even when you didn’t get the quality of sleep you desired. But the pain for a short period will pay off in the long run. 4. Environment - optimize your environment for sleep. Remove digital devices from your room altogether. Use an analog clock. Eliminate as much light as possible. Set the temperature to be around 65 degrees F. or 18 C. Of course these are only the visible tip of the iceberg and for your situation you'll need to assess what habits need to change in your own life. If you want to talk more about your specific situation and what habit change might work best for you then please leave a comment and we can talk through it together. In general here is a good exercise to go through for identifying the most impactful habit changes for your situation: Ask yourself "what is the most likely cause of my insomnia?" Make your best guess, for any change to happen you have to have a starting point, a hypothesis, from there you test the hypothesis and see the results and then make further decisions. So let's say your answer is "my overactive mind." Ok then ask yourself "what causes my mind to be overactive?" Maybe it's stress about family, stress about money, big dreams that are unrealized, excitement about something coming, or anxiety/depression. So now we know the root cause of the insomnia is not the inability to "perform" in bed if you will, but something entirely different. Then we ask what healthy habits can eliminate the need to have deep thoughts in bed? In the situation laid out above most likely it would look like giving yourself a vessel to release thoughts like a journal or conversation with someone who can absorb your thoughts. You'll also look to destress through something like meditation, breathing techniques, or prayer. And then compartmentalize where these specific types of thoughts happen. Training your brain that these thoughts don't happen in bed. (Again the habit of allowing the thoughts in your bed has taken over and now your brain expects it) Now I know this might seem oversimplified and indeed the very act of adopting journaling or a meditative process will be challenging habit changes. That is why it's a long journey. But when you control your mind and body you take back control of your sleep. The battle is in implementing the habit changes that are necessary for a complete sleep makeover. It comes down to not just knowing what needs to change and healthy habits to introduce but also the follow through. This is when accountability is so powerful. To have others along the journey to better sleep with you helping to solidify those better habits with you. This is why I put together a challenge for insomniacs to change their relationship with sleep by implementing better sleep habits. In the challenge insomniacs join together to encourage and push each other to reach the goal of consistent restful sleep every night. If you'd be interested in a challenge like this let me know and I can send you more info. It's not for everyone it's only for those committed to putting in the work to revamp their habits. But it's for those who want long term lasting change and not just a quick momentary fix. In fact, the challenge is only open to 10 challengers at the moment and 7 spots are already taken so if you'd like to be one of the remaining 3 challengers let me know and I'll get you info on how to join. As I said above I'd love to help identify habit changes that you can specifically be applying to your own sleep journey so please tell more of your sleep story in the comments.
NotSignal	I was on the mend, I managed to sleep 7 hours a night without therapy or drugs, only keeping a consistent bed time. It only took one night of getting 3 hours sleep because of hot weather and it spiraled back to no sleep at all. I have other conditions like painful ibs and a few days ago a lump developed on my neck. It's all I worry about now and can't fall asleep and it's making my ibs worse. I can't find a good position to sit in. I try to think rationally but my brain is tired. Even if it's cancerous people with cancer still are able to sleep. Anyone else with these conditions how do you sleep?
NotSignal	I don't care about eating anymore. I just eat these basic things, like breakfast, lunch and dinner. I don't want to eat anything more than that. I used to care about it a lot, but now I just don't feel hungry.I just want to sleep. Don't know if it's normal, but i basically don't give a shit
NotSignal	Why am I getting hypnic jerks at night even when I’m not worrying about anything? Usually when I get hypnjc jerks while I’m sleeping I am worrying about something. When I’m awake right now my muscle still twitch a little.
NotSignal	Is there any way to actually sleep better to fall asleep fast and have a better quality sleep?
Signal	hey guys i got a question. i have really have bad case of insomnia ,i take heave sleeping pills to fall asleep ,it takes like forever to fall in sleep but when i do i always wake up after 2,3hours and then i cant sleep no more ,not even if i take sleeping pills again. i dont care that i only have 2 hours of sleep each day ,but i do care about my day. i wanna enjoy my day and not feeling like a tired zombie the whole time. so the dokter gave me dexamphetamines kinda like adderral but they dont help that much i stay tired. this had been going on for weeks now and im getting apeshit. im gonna ask the dokter today for a epipen adrenaline shot just to keep me awake cause i need to stream (im a videogames streamer) .and benzos wont help either ,im addicted to valium for 7 years i barely feel them. so my question is : does anybody know any medication that can help me ? to stay fresh during the day and be able to function normal cause i cant do shit feeling like this and im getting sick of it. i hope it well blow over . thanks
Signal	Hello all,I am in college currently. My roommate snores like a train engine. I think he has sleep apnea although we have never talked about it. Recently, I bought foam ear plugs and silicone ear plugs and construction-grade ear muffs. I put the foam in first then I put the silicone over the foam then I put the ear muffs on. I can still hear it pretty clearly. I would guess that the people in the rooms next to us can hear it. Would ambien help me sleep through this? Or something else? Or would a drug just be useless against loud noise?The second issue I have is that I take adderall for adhd, and it makes me a light sleeper. This roommate plus adderall is a bad combo. So I already take melatonin and magnesium glycinate to help with the adderall insomnia.
Signal	Hey, everyone.My wife has been suggesting I do this for years, but I keep forgetting and/or putting it off. Warning in advance that this will be a long post, because I am desperate for answers.**TL;DR - My mind is so constantly active and my dreams so constant and intense that I struggle to fall asleep and can't stay asleep. I haven't sleep restfully in decades. Any idea what's wrong with me or what I can do to help?**I am 31 years old and have had insomnia for as long as I can remember - at least since my early teen years. In the past \~2 decades, I have had a total of two nights of sleep that felt genuinely restful. Here's what I know:1. It takes me forever to fall asleep unless I am absurdly tired. Partially because of that, I am almost entirely incapable of napping. My "naps" consist of me laying down wide awake until I eventually get a sort of second-wind and don't feel sleepy anymore.2. Despite the above, my real problem isn't falling asleep - it's the STAYING asleep and the dreaming while I am awake. 1. I wake up constantly throughout the night, like, fully conscious and aware awake. I typically am so tired that I manage to fall back asleep, but from what I've gathered, I'm far more aware of my awake cycles than most people. I probably wake up about every hour. 2. I ONLY dream. Every second of my sleep is dreaming and I've never had a night of sleep where I didn't dream very elaborate dreams the entire night. I only even learned about a year ago that some people don't dream sometimes. I didn't know that was possible. It makes me think that my ONLY sleep is REM, but the sleep studies and my Fitbit both suggest I sleep totally normal and experience all the stages in the right amounts. 1. On the rare chance I manage to stay asleep, my dreams are so elaborate, bizarre, and fast-paced that I wake up truly exhausted. After I wake up on those nights, I have to just lay there for a long time because I'm so exhausted after a dream that made me mentally and physically feel like I just ran a marathon.3. So far, doctors have no idea. I've done two sleep studies about 9 years apart and both suggested I slept totally normal. However, those tests were largely to check common disorders such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.4. I've tried several official medications, but nothing helped in any way that felt helpful to me. 1. I was a kid when I tried two of them, so I don't remember by name what they were (and I will likely try them again soon when I am able to next see a doctor). I think one was Ambien and I don't remember the other. Either way, I only tried a one or two night sample of each and never tried them again. One gave me nightmares so bad I stopped, and the other I stopped because I had no dreams at all, which, per my above point, was so foreign and bizarre to me that it scared me. 2. I've tried Melatonin, other over-the-counter sleep aids, Nyquil, CBN pills, etc. Some of them gave me notably better sleep the very first night, then did absolutely nothing every night after that no matter how long I took them. With Melatonin, I wound up accidentally taking WAY too high of a dose so it had a lot of bad long-term side effects and I stopped. 3. I tried a LOT of strains of marijuana. Only one or two helped slow my mind down enough to help me fall asleep, but nothing has ever helped me stay asleep.5. I typically stay in bed for 8 hours, give or take. I get tired just like anyone else. If anything, I'm almost always some degree of tired. Most of the time I am perfectly fine as long as I'm doing something, but if I have to sit still or get real bored, I feel like I'm going to pass out (but I can't actually sleep, so I just spend several hours being too tired to be productive in any way). However, there are plenty of days where I slept so terribly that I'm too tired to do anything that day - it's not uncommon.6. I \*think\* Lucid dreaming helps. In all my years, I've had a slight lucid dreaming experience twice, and it seemed to help. Unfortunately, I always forget to do what I need to do to get into good lucid dreaming practices. I'll usually remember and be real adamant for a week (writing down my dreams, doing "reality checks", etc.), but then I'll either get lazy or just forget and won't get back to it for a few years.7. I am not sure if this is related and I've never been diagnosed with anything, but I have real bad memory. I assume this has something to do with sleep helping memory, but I am not sure.Well, that's me. Any ideas? I truly appreciate any advice or suggestions.
NotSignal	I’ve been trying desperately to sleep for the past hour but I literally can’t. I’m so worried I’m not gonna be able to sleep. This is my second day up and I’m just so worried. How do I fall asleep I don’t wanna die like this I’m only 14
NotSignal	For some unfathomable reason, I’m super hungry when I can’t sleep. Like I’ll just be chill on reddit at 2 or 3 and then I’m like “damn, I wish I lived near a McDonalds so I can clear out there stock” I’m hungry as I write this, fuck...I’m going to get some crackersSee y’all sometime soon:)
Signal	I have had trouble with insomnia for many years. I don't really want to rely on ambien or tylenol pm. I want to try CBD oil to try to relax enough to sleep, so I bought some online from Blosum. This is new territory for me because I've never used it before. I'm 5'10'' and 170lbs...any idea what dose I should start with? Thanks for the help.
NotSignal	For the past 6 months I wake up every 2 to 3 hours I go back to sleep the most I get is full 4 hours sleep.. I meditate I have sleep routine etc idk what else to do
Signal	Hi everyone I’m new to reditt. I came here because I couldn’t find the answer to my question on google and I was hoping to find answers. The best answer I could find is that I am suffering from some sort of insomnia but I think it may be anxiety instead. When I have an episode it is always at night and I am unable to sleep until the sun comes up no matter how exhausted I am. I get scattered racing thoughts and I have to keep reminding myself I’m fine over and over trying to sleep makes it worse. I am terrified that if I fall asleep I will wake up in a scary horrible place and won’t be able to ever leave and that the life I’m living will just have been a dream/short escape. I know it sounds dumb but it feels very real to me. I think that it’s also worth noting that this does not happen every night. This feeling comes over me at random and it’s hard to convince myself that it isn’t real and sometimes I will be fine for months. If anybody has felt this please let me know. Or if anybody has any idea as to what it could be that would be helpful too, thank you.
NotSignal	I was going to sleep earlier yesterday/today, but that didn’t happen. I went to bed at 1 but I couldn’t really fall asleep, so just laid there for 2 hours. Then I gave up and picked up my phone. Watched some YouTube + Reddit, and then I realized another 2 hours had passed. It’s now 05.51 and I’m so tired. It’s Sunday today so I could sleep all day if I manage too. I’ve really messed up my sleeping routines.
Signal	So i always used to Go to bed pretty later,around 3/7 AM,this since i was younger. Doing this countless times caused me to catch insomnia,which i been struggling with for a long time. But lately,i managed to Go to sleep early and wake up by morning,and i kept this for a while. However,these last days i screwed my sleeping routine and im going to sleep 12/13 PM and then i get up at night,around 8PM.. i mean,im getting enough sleep,but im feeling numb,exhausted,and i also know its not healthy switch day for night... My brain is prolly not producing Melatonin and this is screweing me over... What about you guys? Do you go to sleep by morning and get the same feeling.?
Signal	It's been a constant part of my life for the past 6 years. I dont want to get into any sob stories here because it's not relevant, but I do want to give a brief background of my previous self harm and suicide attempts, just to give perspective.After 6 years, I've finally gotten to the point where I want to live my life, and I dont cut or burn myself anymore. But since I've moved past that my insomnia has gotten much worse. I used to sleep 5-4 nights a week, but now it seems to average around 3 if I'm lucky. I've done a lot of analyzing, and in the past I believe it formed from chronic night terrors that I wanted to avoid. But I dont get those anymore. This has become a new form of self harm for me and I dont know how to break it.It's almost as if I'm trying to push my body to its breaking point. I go 24, 48, 72, 96 hours without sleep. I even count them. I feel like I'm testing myself for some reason. Its toxic, and yet I still find myself, every night, putting sleep off for no logical reason, and not even second guessing myself. It's not safe, I know it's not. People say a night without sleep is like driving drunk. I'm a pizza delivery driver and a college student. I know that I'm putting myself and potentially others at risk here. But theres that small part of me that still eggs me on.I dont know why you guys are suffering, and I can't imagine it's for a reason as dumb as mine... maybe I'm just looking for some advice. I'm not sure. Maybe I just needed to tell someone. I havent slept in 116 hours and yet I feel fine. My body, my legs, my knees, my back and knuckles are constantly screaming at me and yet I've never felt more at peace.Or am I just absolutely bat shit crazyAnd no, I dont take anything. I just smoke weed sometimes.
Signal	Hey, I'd just like to start off by saying I don't think I have insomnia I never have before actually, always been a late sleeper and late waker, but I started thinking I had this disease related to sleeping and I think my anxiety is causing me to not be able to fall asleep... It's currently 4 am and although I've tried to fall asleep to no avail I just want to know can anxiety really cause me to not be able to sleep... And also I have a fear of developing insomnia because from what I've read here so far it's nothing nice and that's scary to think about that I may never sleep peacefully againIf anyone out there is knowledgeable about these sort of things please respond I wanna overcome whatever is stopping me from sleeping please help me
NotSignal	I went to the dentist today (yesterday now) and part of their COViD procedure was making me use Listerine Zero. I’ve never been a bid mouth wash person so I’ve avoided this normally. I had a normal day, ran before 6, and now I’ve been awake all night despite going to bed exhausted. And now it’s 5 a.m. EST and I can’t help but wonder if it was the mouthwash. My appointment was at 4 p.m. EST. Thoughts?
Signal	I haven’t been to sleep for ~24 hours now and I’m laying in bed trying my hardest to go to sleep but the damn rooster crowing outside my window at 6:30 A.M. isn’t exactly helping
Signal	First of all I'm 18 yo.. i usually have insomnia and i have some problems with sleeping but now I'm awake for 2 days and i guess it's the first time for me.. i cried twice cause i get so anxious when i can't sleep and i tried all the tricks i used to do in less severe cases.. what can i do?.. I'm pretty anxious right now and can't think probably.. I'm not sleepy though which is kinda weird lol.
Signal	I’m on Rivotril and it’s the only medication that’ll work currently. Otherwise I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and struggle several hours before I could sleep.
Signal	I've rarely had trouble with sleep in my life. I'm an RA in a college dorm and all of last semester I slept in my room fine. I got back to school this semester and for the past 2 weeks my sleep had been a shit show, with many nights of little sleep or no sleep at all. This has caused me significant anxiety to the point I had a panic attack and had to leave work and the anxiety following has been hellish. I've tried Xanax, trazodone, the only thing that's kind of worked for me is Natural Vitality Calmful Sleep melatonin and magnesium supplement in the highest dose. I'm miserable. I'm scared I'm gonna have to leave my job and/or school or that my health will suffer even though it's only been 2 weeks. Has anyone overcome short term insomnia and how?
NotSignal	Without the crisis in the world, mental health wasn't great. Watching the emergency statement tonight (I'm from the UK) gave me a panic attack. I'm getting about 6 hours a night. How's everyone else doing?
Signal	I don’t know why I think it’s my depression due to having bipolar. I can’t sleep throughout the night like I used to be able to do. I’d wake up every few hours or wake up in the middle of the night around 04:00 - 05:00 A.M. even though I am able to go back to sleep they’d be times when it’s morning already and I can’t continue to sleep. I think it’s part of having something similar to having insomnia which is sleep disruption. I’m able to sleep well only on Benzodiazepines like Rivotril but I’m afraid of building a tolerance and addiction to the sleeping pills would make things worst i think.
Signal	Nothing helps me sleep, not even bellsomra. Often I will fall asleep and wake up an hour or so later. Eventually I'll fall asleep and stay asleep, but at least once I'll wake up. Anyone else?
Signal	Well here I am at 3 am posting here again as I feel as though I'm actually starting to go insane. Tried to sleep tonight but got hot and started to sweat and feel like shit, pulled up the blankets, opened wide the windows and pretty much removed all my clothes: and I still get sweaty and hot. I'm actually starting to lose my mind; I've lost interest in sleeping because of how I feel when I go to sleep. I guess I will have to wait again for fucking 5 am before I pass out to sleep 3 hours and wake up dead again. I'm scared. I'm gonna try and cut out electronics completely tomorrow, maybe that's part of it I really have no idea. Now just the thought of the horrible nights I'm passing is enough to not get me to sleep. Help.
NotSignal	This is probably just a pseudoscience thing, but I was wondering if anyone had any luck using sound waves to help them sleep? A friend of mine puts on headphones every night and listens to delta waves and she swears they help her drift off better.
NotSignal	Last night I couldn't keep it in anymore and bawled my eyes out on my SO, they stroke my head and I slept... Until 1:00 p.m. ... After a week and a half of little/no sleep, I hadn't even noticed I couldn't fully open my eyes until I was finally able to sleep, I was so excited to sleep today I was actually looking forward to sleep time (Something I've dreaded for years now) idk what was I expecting, it's nearly 4:00 a.m., my eyes hurt, and I am miserable again, i don't know what to do
NotSignal	i have some ear problems and for a couple years now whenever i lay down and close my eyes i get really dizzy and feel like i'm spinning and swaying, but for even longer i've felt like i keep changing sizes ? for almost as long as i can remember almost every other night i feel like i'll grow and shrink, or certain parts of my body will grow and shrink. anyone else have the same/ similar issues ? if you do do you know what they're from ?side note i made this post cause i've been off my amitriptyline for a while now (because i can't go out to the pharmacy rn) and it's been a bit worse since, got me thinking about it
NotSignal	Not an overdose amount at all but I took too much I feel extremely tired, but when I close my eyes, I feel like I float out of my body and then I gasp for breath and get startled. I also have occasionally moments where my room doesn't look familiar.It sucks to be so tired that it prevents you from falling asleep... Idk how to explain it.... It's just when I close my eyes I feel myself fall asleep but my mind doWesn't shut off, it's like reverse sleep paralysis or something.... I feel myself fall asleep but I'm still conscious and it feels SO WEIRD like I'm disappearing from my body.
Signal	I’m 19M and have anxiety/insomnia, Low T and chronic pain. I just got prescribed trazadone and am I already on tramadol and HRT. Anyone have any experience with it? My doctor used to give me temazepam and Ativan, but now gave me trazadone to fall asleep, but I hate SSRI’s and am trying to lose weight. I’m considering just not taking it because I already have horrible antidepressant side effects from tramadol and I can’t afford to be hungry/gain more weight as well as the erectile/sexual dysfunction it causes.
Signal	I have major depression disorder with anxiety. My mental health, like I’m sure everyone’s depends on a restful sleep. And I got that for 2 years. Ambien has quit working for me. I’ve taken trash adon in the past and hated. Is there anything out there that will work will and make me sleep? I want to present my doctor with options bc she tells me I’ve got the best stuff for my problem. No I don’t, it doesn’t work. Then I run out and can’t refill and for two weeks loose my shit
Signal	So here's the thing. I never had problems sleeping until I became stressed about a situation last year. I started taking otc sleep meds and they worked great, until they didn't. Then I fell into months of insomnia. Yesterday i threw out all my sleeping meds. I completely exhausted my body. I ran 5 miles, which is normal for me, then I did a little extra workout. I walked my dogs a ton, I walked on my treadmill for 2 hours, I went grocery shopping. I didn't let myself sit until like 6. And I was TIRED. But it worked. I closed my laptop around 7, listened to some calming music, I made hot tea and sipped it. Then I would say I fell asleep around 8:45, only took about 15 minutes to fall asleep!. I woke up around midnight pee and thought oh no, that's it..I'm up for good, but no. I fell back asleep within a couple minutes. Both times instead of letting my mind race, I made up a boring story in my head. I just pictured myself in a scenario and it eased my anxiety. My dog woke me up around 3:50 to pee and I thought about trying to go back to sleep but I had slept a solid 7 hours and I was too excited. Lately on meds I felt like even when I was sleeping, it was like half sleep. And I'd wake up every 40 minutes or so.I'm also hoping by not sleeping in, that itll help re regulate my schedule so I'll be tired tonight too. Maybe the key to my sleep is no meds at all🤷‍♀️
Signal	Hello, sorry this is so long, this is my first post here after discovering this sub, I have suffered from insomnia for around 20 years. This is incredibly embarrassing and distressing for me to talk about, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I have seen a couple of articles online where people have had hallucinations after lack of sleep, but they seemed to be aware that they were hallucinating, and I truly, truly believed what I was seeing was real :(3 days ago I had been awake for 72 hours. I was convinced that there were fish swimming out from under my floor, and that there was a snake in a plastic bag in my living room. I actually took a video on my phone of this and sent it to a friend and my mother - just thinking about this makes me cringe. I actually called the police to get rid of the snake because I was so terrified, they came out and obviously no snake. I assumed it had moved elsewhere in my apartment. The police asked me about my mental health and then left. They then had apparently called paramedics, who checked me over and asked me the mental health screening questions like the date, year, who the prime minister is etc. I was convinced at that point that the snake was on one of the sofas in my living room, and after they left I could see it clearly - a HUGE snake, if I made a noise it would react, it was slowly opening and closing its mouth...I wasn't scared by this but wouldn't go near it. I even took more photos. I also called the RSPCA to come and get it. They did attend and as soon as they did I couldn't see the snake anymore. They searched my place and found nothing, looked at the photos and said they were not convinced that it was a snake. I was still COMPLETELY convinced at this stage, about 12 hours after I first 'saw' it.In the meantime, my friend was incredibly worried about me and the texts I was sending her telling her about the snake. I want to smack myself in the face thinking about this now! As I work with her, she spoke with my HR contact and they had a conference call with me, concerned about my mental state. They asked permission to speak with my brother (my next of kin, my parents live abroad). My brother came over after work and searched my place again and told me that he fully believed that I was hallucinating. He told me that he had experienced it too after going several days without sleep. I still insisted it was real. My brother also insisted that I eat something as I'd gone a couple of days without food - I'm severely disabled and can't cook meals when I'm having bad days so have been eating only once a day for a while as I have to depend on meal delivery services. That evening I was really scared, believing that there was a snake somewhere in my home. I set up barriers of plastic bags around so I'd hear the snake moving around. Thankfully I fell asleep with the help of some sleeping pills (far too many actually- 350mg diphenhydramine, some clonazepam and mirtazapine). The next day I knew that I'd been hallucinating. I felt so so upset, embarrassed, horrified that so many people were witness to my psychosis episode. The paramedics had spoken to my doctor, who is incredibly good and familiar with my problems with insomnia as well as my complex medical history. She is part time though so told them to instruct me to get an emergency telephone consultation as soon as possible. I spoke to a doctor I had never seen before late the day after the hallucinations. He was absolutely horrible, was somehow convinced that I was calling to obtain Tramadol, when in fact I'd been trying to explain my recent medical history since he was unfamiliar with my case. I've been on painkillers long term for a severe back injury. He shouted at me, wouldn't let me speak, and at the end of the call told me he was going to prescribe me Amitryptaline with no explanation. I was very distressed throughout the call and for the rest of the evening in floods of tears. Thankfully the next day a GP I've had treatment under before called me and was very kind, she spent about 40mins discussing treatment options (the first call lasted just over 5 minutes). She had obviously read my medical records and hospital correspondence, MRI results etc. She decided that the best option for me is to begin treatment with fentanyl transdermal patches to cope with the chronic pain which contributes to my insomnia. She also explained the Amitriptyline and how it would help, and increased the amount of mirtazapine I take. We also discussed other measures that will possibly help as zopiclone doesn't work for me anymore. So, I'm hoping that things will improve, but I'm still terrified of the hallucinations happening again, and still very tearful and embarrassed about what happened. Last night I began the Amitriptyline and got about 3 hours of sleep. On Monday I begin the fentanyl, and I am both glad that my pain is being taken seriously and apprehensive about taking such a strong painkiller. My brother is coming over today to help with some housework and have lunch with me, so I'm looking forward to having him to speak to. I'd really like to know how common this is though, or if my brain is completely screwed up...I'm so scared of this happening again, it was absolutely real to me, now I can't help but wonder if I can really trust anything that I see!
Signal	It's 11, there's a seed of worry that I won't get to sleep tonight. And it just grows and grows and grows until the sun starts to creep through my blinds. Then when I decide to fuck it and just not sleep, I blink and the little sleep I get is apparently over. I can only tell because my alarm clock says it's two hours later. And I'm running late for work.Or it's a day I work at 4, and that same light through those same blinds smother me to sleep until noon and I piss away the few hours I could be productive hating myself for fucking up again.Or maybe I'm on a good track: I've been doing rituals before bed, I'm taking my xanax and lean into the sleep, My S.A.D. light alarm clock is waking me up at a decent time, I make a cup of coffee, I get some writing done, and I'm finally starting to feel like a real person.But then it's 11, there's a seed of worry.
Signal	I have been on 5mg of Lexapro for some time due to anxiety (it has actually helped despite the very low dose), and my insomnia has been bonkers lately so I went to my psychiatrist and he put me on 50mg of Trazodone. I happen to also be a medical marijuana patient due to crazy pain from IBS and the insomnia as well. While the weed helps me get to sleep it doesn't help me stay asleep. Now, I am reading about serotonin syndrome-- I am relatively certain (using my psych major degree to use) that marijuana doesn't act on serotonin the way SARI's and SSRIs do.Has anyone taken such low doses of Lex and Traz together? What was your experience? (if you happen to also use medical marijuana alongside these I would be curious if you had any issues and your experiences.)&#x200B;Sorry for repost, but I think I posted my original post too early in the AM for people to see.
NotSignal	I’m desperate for any hope. I have multiple appointments coming up including with a therapist, but want to know how to advocate for myself.
Signal	Hi, I was put on 50 mg Quetiapine for sleep to take as needed for my insomnia. Is anyone else on this for their sleeping issues? Is this common? And how is it for you? I was on Trazodone previously, but it wasn't strong enough...thanks.
Signal	It's been 3 weeks exactly now, this whole covid situation really messed me up guys.. Suffering brutal Insomnia all of the sudden and in the past few days i've got panic feelings, i cried(yes im a 23 year old man but i cried), and i barely did anything. I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed me with anti depressants, but i really wouldn't want to take them since they have rly bad side effects.... Im just really sad, angry, everything i got so many mixed feelings right now and i wish i could just talk with somebody about it..
NotSignal	I don’t recall always having this problem but it’s been happening so consistently I sort of lost track of when it first started happening. I generally sleep sort of late from around 1am to 5am. When I go to sleep it takes no problem at all and I’d usually fall asleep in less than 10 minutes. The problem is I keep waking up around 7am to 9am and it’s really hard for me to go back to sleep. If I don’t force myself to go back to sleep i’d be really tired the whole day and it’s just not ideal. I’d much much rather just sleep til 2pm. Why does this happen? And why has it only started happening relatively recently (maybe around 3/4 a year)? All my friends that sleep late have no problem sleeping til practically dinner time the next day(obviously don’t want to do this but still).-I don’t wake up to pee or anything -I don’t drink any caffeine at all-I have black out curtains -There are no noises that wake me up -Nothing noticeable has changed from how I slept back when there was no problem to how I sleep now
Signal	I've had sleep problems for the last few years, which have only been intensified this past year. I finally convinced my dad to let me speak with my doctor about it, who recommended I get my blood drawn to check for any health problems and said she would refer me to a psychologist. I took the blood test and my results came back completely normal, and I never heard back about that referral. My dad thinks I was overreacting, and the other day I talked about being tired and trying to fall asleep (to no avail) and he said "see! You were probably just stressed!" I'm at a loss. I feel like I can't be helped anymore, and every night I get so frustrated that I just want to hurt myself. Nothing over the counter has helped. I just want to sleep like a normal person.
NotSignal	Since New Year i probably have 8-10 hours slept. The fuck is wrong with me?
Signal	I hate it when I say I have insomnia and people say something like "Haha yeah I have that, I didn't get to sleep until 2am lol"Anyone else hate that shit or am I unreasonable?
Signal	Short story, has just gone 5 nights without any sleep despite taking 8 drops of **amitriptyline** (apparently 4mg per drop so 32mg). Went to the doctor again, she couldn't offer any miracles obviously but said she could go gradually upto 20 drops if needed (100mg). She's in bed now after upping to 14 drops from 8. I hope she's asleep. The stress is killing me and the insomnia is destroying her. She's booked into a sleep institute where we live but waiting time was shit and it's not until march.... Feeling helpless and desperate. 5 fucking nights in a row. I didn't know that was possible. If anyone can offer any support I would love to hear......
NotSignal	Everyday I wake up feeling like shit from terrible sleep. My day revolves around making sure I can attempt good sleep ect. I noticed that when I say fuck it and stay awake, I feel like me again. Normal. Not burnt out n retarded. I can actually talk to ppl and Want to talk lol. Growing up I always stayed up super late because I feel the best/most normal at night. It’s like it takes me all day to wake up n then it’s time togoto bed and I want to stay up because I feel good!Anyone else do this? I heard it’s terrible for ya to skip sleep
NotSignal	Hi all, I'm someone who has had a few bouts of insomnia that can last weeks to months but eventually resolve. Typically sleep can range from none to 4-5 hours. I recognize that considering the spectrum of difficulties related to insomnia my problems are a bit more benign. I was curious who here has been able to manage a high stress job or multiple responsibilities on limited sleep?
Signal	no o sleep even though o take meicine to sleep but kt didntt work. i didnt sleep for a whole day nowww i have schizophrenia and not sleep is badd i guesd welll l i get bugs visions and they come everywjrere and go but its really annoying because what if if alivee my brain keeos spasning i am so tired but st 12 pm i cannot gk to sleep now. i wasted my adderall because i thougjt i xan stay up but nononononononononobobobobobobononononono o am too tired please i wwnt sleep but i cant and i ront het it i am having small black out but i cant i cant sleep i cant cant ant
NotSignal	I put on a healthy mindset that I will recover in the future. Is that right or am I making a fool out of myself?
NotSignal	I've been trying to trick my mind as well. I guess I just got bad wiring or something.I rarely ever work out so I'm out of shape asf too(not overweight).The other day I worked out for 30 minutes and 2 days later I had blood in my piss for working out too intensively for my current health so I guess that's a no go as well.Can I get a few Fs in the chat pls.
Signal	I've had insomnia all my life, to some degree. Some months/years have been much worse than others, but it's always there. I've tried EVERYFECKINGTHING and not a damn thing can both help me fall asleep, and then stay asleep. And now, the past 7 or 8 years, I've had horrible chronic pain that often keeps me up. Painsomnia is so much worse, and I stupidly thought that that wasn't possible. I slept about 2 hours so far tonight. Not sure how much more I'll get, but I have to get up and start my day at 8am, regardless.UGGHHHHH!!!
Signal	There’s so much negative feedback on these groups, and so much of the discussions here revolve around drugs and how shitty the insomniac life is. Of course it’s shitty. I’ve been there. Bad bad. Like 2 hours to no hours for months on end bad. Contemplated suicide bad. And the only positive thing that stemmed from this group was one lone voice that led me to find cbti and the world of insomnia coaches that actually help you without the use of drugsBelieve me guys, I tried it all...mirtazapine, tramadol, antidepressants up the wazoo (literally everything they could throw at me), zoplicone, etc... Even Had a beautiful love affair with benzos which ended with me being on the verge of a mental breakdown an entire month when I quit (don’t recommend this route for anyone). All this to end up where I wish I had started: Looking up real ways to cure this issue. To this end, I eventually landed on a YouTube channel and app that eventually changed my life man. Seriously. I don’t say this lightly. I went though the worst period of my life and this channel was like the elixir of life forMy hopeless soul. I know you’re reading this and thinking to yourself that your case is different, that you won’t be able to recover from this without drugs or some super uninvented intervention, but I’m here to tell you that hope is closer than you know. Look up the sleepcoachschool on YouTube and look at all of Coach daniel’s videos. I know this sounds like a kid advertisement so it should be insightful when I tell you the only thing I was paid was the recovery of my sleep and my life. And I want the same for you, the reader I imagine was me in the past - a voice I wish I had heard before I went on this terrible journey that could have ended me in much a worst spot. Good luck to all you out there. You CAN and WILL sleep again. I’ll save you the research (I interviewed hundreds of recovered insomniacs on my journey) and they all took the same drugs was route. TRUST ME PLSSLEEPCOACHSCHOOL on YouTube. Do it!!!
NotSignal	Single bed makes me hard to sleep. The worst is on the top bed of a double decker. Anyone else have this experience?
NotSignal	Man gasping for air while in the process of falling asleep is the worst feeling ever. Anyone know what the causes for it could be? It happens to me occasionally and it makes it really difficult to fall asleep.
Signal	Until recently my melatonin gummies and zzzquil would work, but within the last week they have stopped working and I am exhausted I barely sleep 😩 I literally just want to cry right now bc I am tired but I cannot fall asleep. I took 6 gummies and 2 zzzquil tabs and nothing 😭 I made a online dr appt for in the morning- what’s a common prescribed sleep aid? I’ve researched and a lot of people find that trazodone helps them.
NotSignal	I’ve spent four nights now thrashing around in my sleep. It’s the worst when I start to relax, ironically, like falling asleep my body jumps and jumps, sometimes it feels like a loud bang or explosion. My husband taped me this morning, I cry out sometimes and wince, like I’m in pain, but I don’t remember. My legs kick and sometimes I laugh, it’s the strangest thing! I’m on pretty high Paxil dosage, 80 mg, and have been suuuuuper stressed out (moved, started a new job) but the stressors are over and every night I still do this, all night, husband says. I wake up exhausted, and have been shaky and confused and weak all week. My doctor doesn’t get back from vacation til September 21, soooo will I be ok til then?? Has anyone else ever dealt with this? I feel delirious but no fever. How long can one go without sleep?
NotSignal	Hey all. Today I was prescribed 15 mg of remeron for my horrible insomnia. I’m reading side effects online and it seems like weight gain in large amounts is almost certain. I can’t have this!! Does everyone experience this? Or is it really only a concern at higher dosages?
NotSignal	Hey pals, I’m shivering in my bed because I cannot sleep without my loud ass fan on but Wisconsin weather is getting pretty brisk pretty fast. I live in a studio apartment (so it cools really fast) on the corner of a busy intersection so I rely on my fan to block out noise when I try to get some sleep. But shit I’m chilly!! Anyone have any luck with air purifiers or anything? A sound machine won’t be loud enough and ear plugs gross me out. I keep my fan pointed toward the wall but it still circulates and cools the place down too well. Any suggestions?
Signal	was already having sleep issues for whatever reason and was in a car accident last week that I’m 99% sure I have PTSD from now. I’m going to see a doctor in 5 hours and I’ve gotten maybe 2 hours. Nothing is working. No herbal supplement, deep breathing, meditation, crying, exercising, talking to people, distracting self, laying down is going to make this dread go away that I haven’t slept and have work and appointments today. This is torture. Please God. I don’t smoke, drink, or do any drugs (besides caffeine) which I quit since I’ve felt this. I don’t know how to describe it, it’s like anxiety but I’m anxious when I go to bed so I don’t know what to do. I’m anxious like it’s a doom and depression feeling, not necessarily feeling panic. Just sadness over how tired I am and fearful that my body will never be normal again. I just want to graduate college this year and this semester has been so busy I feel so behind.
Signal	Currently all I’m thinking about is my wallet being lost out in the world it’s the worst feeling knowing you lost your wallet somewhere you don’t even know. It honestly gives me anxiety knowing that I’m going to have to send off for a new debit card and ID this will be really annoying because this is going to be my second time setting up a new debit card and second time applying for a new ID so things are not going my way this year. I can’t sleep and because of depression I can’t sleep anyway
Signal	I fall asleep around 8-9 am and only get a few hours of sleep. Sometimes I can't sleep for a few days and honestly I can't take it anymore, I'm so tired all the time. I'm almost 16, and just wondering am I always going to suffer?
NotSignal	Seriously it works if you are willing to put the effort and time into following a proper sleep window. It has completely changed my life. I've gone from never having slept over 6 hours in a year to consistently great sleep. A lot of people on this sub recommend a 'do it yourself reading a book approach' but I think seeing a professional therapist or a coach works wonders. I've been using an app with a coach (Got laid off and couldn't afford a therapist) and having someone to hold you accountable has forced me to follow the strict sleep restriction schedule and has really really helped me. Not being able to sleep is the hardest problem I've ever faced and each and every one of you is so tough and brave having to live with it every day.
Signal	What in the fuck is wrong with me why do I keep jerking awake every time I begin falling asleep. This is the biggest fucking cock tease. Blue balls will never equal the amount of pain my brain is subjecting me. That little moment of uncomfortable clarity as your heart races and you hear the sheets move because your neck and arms decide to say fuck you, you don't deserve sleep and you get practically RKOed into wakefulness by a sudden twitch. Hypnic jerks can lick my sweaty ass just shoot me up with drugs and let me sleep for a week.On a more serious note, any one else have experiences with this bullshit? Also its 6am and I need to wake up for my commute to work in less than 2 hours. Fuck me...
NotSignal	I work swing shifts and get off at midnight. Been barely sleeping the last 3 days. Anyone up?
Signal	I had terrible insomnia before having a surgery to correct my wisdom teeth sites. Basically they were infected (called cavitations) and there’s no way of knowing besides getting a 3D cone beam scan, xrays don’t pick these up for some reason. But since I got the surgery to fix it I have had amazing sleep in which I fall asleep at 10:50 on the dot! I know what it’s like and how awful it can be to not be able to count on your body to do the things you want so hopefully this will help someone.
NotSignal	On the odd occasion I am unable to open my eyes and “come to” out of nightmares from listening to rain sounds, which are white noise if I’m correct? I also feel like something else takes over me... someone evil? I am desperate for sleep and it helps my nerves like nothing else does so I keep listening to it
Signal	I'm up since 3 days now because I couldn't get a wink of sleep and I'm already dreading the night. I have pretty bad insomnia since 2 years now, often with days without sleep in a row. I know that in my case it's anxiety induced, I'm already taking Trazadon but it's honestly not doing much. I think the main cause is probably the fear of dieing due to sleep deprivation. I really try to have a good sleep hygiene, reducing the lights two hours before bedtime, not drinking coffee in the afternoon and evening, going at the same to bed every day and standing up at the same time too, but it doesn't really help all that much. My strategy now is to be sort of "ok" with the idea of dieing, be it counterproductive to our instincts or not, as a coping mechanism, but it's tough since I have pretty bad anxiety, that increases with every sleepless night in a row. I had some success with just "accepting" not being able to sleep, which helped me sleeping in on some nights, but, again, it's hard when you get tag teamed by your anxiety and your stress. What are your best coping mechanism and ways to realax yourself inspite of insomnia?
NotSignal	Don’t wait a sleepless night to start nighttime mindfulness meditation. Find back the most ancient and simple wisdom of the world: the capacity to rest. Check out these 3 things that most people don’t know.
Signal	I don't know what to do at this point and I just want to sleep but my anxiety won't let me. I'm gonna set up a doctor appointment tomorrow but in the mean time what should I do? I'm suffering and miserable.
NotSignal	Just the prospect of another night of shitty sleep, or no sleep. The days are long enough, then the nights bring no relief.
NotSignal	It’s 1:30 am here, don’t mind me I’m just wanna rant. My friends can literally go out like a light in seconds and here I am typing the night away after 3 hours of not being able to sleep. It’s not fair, like how can people do that? How can they manage to just close their eyes and shut their mind down??? I’m here staring at the ceiling, my eyes are about to dry up, I tried closing them, that didn’t work, I’ve been doing that for god knows how long and I just wanna cry. It’s not fair, like sleep is a natural thing to do, as a person, as a living organism (minus bacteria and stuff idk do they even sleep whatever I couldn’t care less about biology rn but you get what I mean) I’m supposed to be able to fall asleep easily, my body needs it I love sleep heck I crave it all the time but doing so.... it’s just so damn hard seriously screw this, sorry for the rant it’s annoying but I just wanna get this off my chest this is so frustrating
NotSignal	Reading about them now and I’m about to go on a full on amazon vitamin binge buy right now. What do you recommend? What doesn’t work? What brands? Ect.
NotSignal	Look up this YouTube channel, everyone. Please. For the sake of all of your well being. This forum is so filled with negative shit, its no wonder I got worst, after joining these conversations, before I got better once I left the negative feedback loops you find on here. Bottom line is, I know what you’re all going through. I went through a bit of insomnia that would make anyone wanna kill themselves and I won’t pretend like the thought didn’t find itself coming into serious consideration. But I know many of you have the spirit of perseverance and given the chance, would want to fix this for yourself. What if I told you there is a cure? Not a shortcut shitty snake oil bs type of cute, but a real fucking cure. You would take it In one second right?Well I’m telling you I found the cure. It’s not a medicine (in fact it discourages medicine altogether) and it’s not fast or simple, but it’s effective. It’s education, and adopting a mindset that incorporates some cbt along the way. Look up “TheSleepCoachSchool” on YouTube and really really eat up everything you can on there, particularly the last couple of videos. This man, Coach Daniel, deserves the noble prize for the work he’s done regarding insomnia. He’s going to be huge one day with regards to his approach to treating it. I was a huge skeptic and like many of you thought there was no fucking way anything short of a fucking tranquilizer was going to knock me out but I’m telling you...there is a way. I’m So fucking passionate about this topic because it hit so close to home it was deadly scary. And I don’t wish this on anyone. Believe me when I say I truly thought I couldn’t be cured, that I was “different” that I would never ever ever ever ever sleep again, that I would die like this. But there is hopeTheSleepCoachSchool. Look it up. Please. Please. Do it for yourself. Learn as much as you can from this man. He loves what he does so fucking much. Message him, email him, call him. He will save your life like he did mine. Don’t lose hope. You can. You will...sleep again.
NotSignal	Has anyone tried taking Valerian for insomnia? I took it in a tea form for several nights and found it easier to get to sleep, however each time I woke up I experienced a moment of sheer terror. After a few days I found it ineffective anyway. Has anyone else had an experience with this?
Signal	I’ve been having sleepless or nights with very little sleep for the past couple weeks. I was previously a heavy pot smoker and that would take care of things for me. But I had a health issue pop up that is driving some crazy anxiety. Smoking was making me feel bad so I stopped for a few days. Have mostly been taking natural stuff to get me to sleep, but last night I took 0.5mg Xanax (from a friend), and decided to try smoking a new strain that wouldn’t make me feel paranoid. I smoked several bowls. I slept for maybe an hour and awoke in a panic with my thoughts racing, heart pounding and my muscles trembling. I took another .25mg xanax and I ended up calming down some but could not get back to sleep and mostly just laid down with my eyes closed last night for hours.Just wondering if it makes any sense to y’all that anxiety could be so strong that things that previously would help calm me down and sedate me are not working?
Signal	Hi allHere to get genuine feedback on my situation. Thank you for taking the time to read this (and possibly reply).First off: this is repost. I also posted this in r/n24 and r/dspdI'm really desperate. Figured I'd get it out in front of these 3 communities. I apologize if that's bad practice.--Ever since I was really young, I was forced to wake up early to go to school. Most mornings, I was totally sleep deprived. I don't know if the reason was something deeper or just distractions which kept me up late. Maybe both, maybe not.Aside of that.. 10-15 years later.. I still cannot wake up early. And believe me, I have tried. For the last 4-5 years, I actively monitored my sleep. I actively tracked my sleep habits. I've tried a lot of "so called solutions" and "best sleep practices".And for short amounts of time... (read: days to max 1 week maybe.. I have managed to consistently wake up at an early time. Early being 9 AM. But then it just all collapses again. And I'm back to zero.I started reading and researching more about sleep and found a lot of research suggesting that you being a morning or evening (or night) person might be heavily affected by your genetics and possibly out of your control.Based on that and a lot of other things I read, I decided to stop trying to force myself to go through this horrible cycle of "wake up early. Wake up early. Fail to do so. Sleep deprived for another week. Sleep in 1 more week. Try again"Instead.. I started sleeping longer and stopped feeling bad about myself sleeping until, say 11am.I really thought I fixed the problem there. Then over the last year or so.. my sleeping time kept moving up. And heck, I consider myself a very disciplined person. I can exercise twice in a day.. work A LOT.. eat healthy.. but sleep. Nah. It just.. it doesn't make any sense. I set sleep schedules. I have a range of triggers to help me to go to bed early. All the sleep aids. All the sleep supplements. I tried a lot. Of course not all.. but a lot. Bottom line: whatever I seem to do, my sleep always seems to be.. changing?I cannot ever seem to consistently wake up with an alarm at the same time. And I cannot seem to go to bed at the same time.. consistently either.Some other notes: my fiance used to tell me "just go to bed earlier". Well, if I try to sleep before.. say 2100 or heck.. even before 0000.. I usually wake up 1h30 - 3 hours later (unless I am really sleep deprived, obviously)This kept happening. Like a long nap. And then I'd before awake all night.. from say.. 0200 till 0600 and only then I'd be able to sleep again.And I admit.. yes.. I then just use that time for something else. I've been told before "just try and go back to sleep" - but this is the thing. I can't sleep. I don't know why.. but once I'm awake.. I'm awake.And I don't want to spend 2 hours trying to sleep to then just not be able to sleep.. so I might as well try to use that time productively.Oftentimes I feel like there's something wrong with me. People seem to sleep so easily. They seem to just fall asleep. Never in my life.. have I fallen asleep without knowing. Never... I wish I could fall asleep just like that.I just. I don't want sleep to be such a chore anymore. It's so exhausting. A part of me just wants to never use an alarm anymore and just sleep whenever I'm tired. But when I do that.. I don't know.. the sleep really seems out of whack.Last night I tried to wind down alarm 0130.. ended up only sleeping at 0430.. woke up at 1400.I don't know. Sorry for the ramble. Thank you for reading this far. Any feedback or thoughts would really be appreciated.
NotSignal	So, I have always suffered from GAD, OCD, and panic disorder. Luckily, in recent years I have managed to overcome my panic disorder and for the most part my OCD, but a little bit of my OCD and most of my GAD is still there. I never had a tv in my room growing up (which in hindsight was a good move on my parents’ part), but as I got older I started streaming TV on my laptop to help me fall asleep. To a certain extent, I think it does help because it distracts me as I’m trying to go to bed. I used to lie in bed motionless every night drenched in sweat, unable to sleep, completely under the covers so I couldn’t see shadows in my room at night. When I watch TV, I focus on the show and it helps me fall asleep. Or at least it used to—now, not so much.I’ve been doing this “watch tv to fall asleep” routine for about 8 years now. For the past year or so, my sleep schedule has been deteriorating a lot. I try to watch tv to fall asleep and feel more energized than I have in the past. Is it the blue light screens? Does anyone else do this? Am I just weird? Is there anything I can do that would help? I’m so afraid to go back to falling asleep without tv again, but I’m 99% sure that’s what’s been causing me problems recently.
NotSignal	I cant take naps whatever I do, I only be able to sleep at night, I used to be able to take naps but now I cant. Can people take nap?
NotSignal	i dont have insomnia but when i spend to much time trying to fall asleep i get anxious that i wont get enough sleep and it turns in to anxiety that keeps me up even longer. anyone experiencing the same?
NotSignal	Does anyone else become hyper aware of their breathing at night?? I feel like I have to breath manually and every time I almost fall asleep it’s like suffocating for a second and I wake up and spend the rest of the night trying to breath normally again
NotSignal	So I have had issues with falling asleep my whole life. I believe it’s a hereditary thing since my brother suffers even worse than I do. But thankfully, I’ve had a summer job and I’ve been keeping an efficient sleep schedule (usually going to bed around 9-10 and getting up at 5-6).Now on the weekends, sometimes I have stuff to do and I find myself in bed around 11, 2 hours after I should be sleeping. After getting up at 4:45 in the morning and taking a short nap during the day, at night I tried falling asleep at 11. I was pretty tired, and I didn’t think I’d have any issue falling asleep.But for some reason, I started ruminating over random thoughts. I’ve had my experience with meditation, so I understand the idea of separating myself from my thoughts in a way - but I was thinking just extremely random thoughts and going down thought patterns that were essentially completely random. It was almost like my brain was on autopilot, and someone turned the knob to hyper speed. I would be trying to sleep, but would be thinking about WWII or politics or something and be deep down a pattern of thought I had no interest in. I was so disconnected from my thoughts, but they were keeping me awake. If I had no experience with meditation, I’d assume I was possessed by my thoughts - but I understand that everyone is always possessed by thought.I’ve had this happen to me before, and usually it goes away if I change the location of where I sleep (moving from my bed to the couch) and give myself a minute to calm down. But does anyone else suffer from this, does this phenomenon have a name, and does this hint at a larger mental health / sleep related issue?
NotSignal	I just wanted to post about what has worked for me so far and helped with my sleep somewhat - only one cup of a caffeinated drink early in the morning - no phone two hours before bed - no food four hours before bed - minimal drinks before bed - sleepy tea - yogi tea is great - love there Kava tea - magnesium citrate powder in water a couple of hours before bed - passionflower extract before bed - reading before I go to sleep - sleeping with an eye mask It’s all been trial and error but I would say by drinking loads of caffeine and not eating right before bed has helped so so much!! I would definitely give these things a try, you’ve got nothing to lose!
NotSignal	i literally just roll around at night , not going to sleep and i dont even notice it happening right before my eyes.. literally as if im doing it mindlessly. and then i finally check my phone and im like wow was i really up for this long just rolling around in bed? it usually happens when im super stressed or anxious...
Signal	So I’ve been having trouble sleeping lately and at the time of writing I’ve been awake 28 hours (the longest I’ve been awake in 30 years) my doctor suggested me staying awake until tonight so my body is completely ready to sleep with the help of some medication . But being as health worried as I am think something bad is going to happen if I’m awake too long.. when I try to sleep I’m always thinking about how ‘if I stay awake for x amount of time’ I’ll end up in hospital or dead. Sorry if this sounds extreme but I’m a nervous wreck right now I guess I’m just looking for confirmation that staying awake for long hours/days isn’t as awful as I think it is Thanks
Signal	I’m seriously considering going to rehab at this point because I can’t do it on my own... I will end up taking the pill and sleep... if not I will drive myself crazy. Has anyone else done rehab and weaned off pills?
NotSignal	all my life i have been a amazing sleeper like -5 minutes and in out for 8 hours. but for the past 4 days it has taken me 3-4 hours too get too sleep. my gf is telling me im sleeping on and off in those hours but my mind feels 100% awake after 3-4 hours i guess my brain fully falls alseep because i remember nothing. anyone have any idea whats wrong with me?
NotSignal	I’ve suffered from minor insomnia every now and then in the past and currently have gotten myself into some at the moment. This insomnia may seem insignificant or minor to some, especially in comparison to some other users in this subreddit but it is significantly impacting me as a person and I am very worried it’s going to get worse.So pretty much about 4 days ago I had a night where I couldn’t fall asleep at my usual time, 12am-ish, and the next night I could only sleep around 3 hours (this was frustrating because I told myself it didn’t matter I didn’t sleep because tomorrow I would surely be tired enough to sleep plenty). I try, I lay for hours and just can’t sleep and it’s been like that for the past 4 days either getting minimal or no sleep and I’ve napped a couple times during the day for around 1 hour. It’s affecting my personality and I feel emotionally approaching the the end of my rope. I also don’t know if this is a caus or relation but during the day I feel almost nauseous but generally just tired and sick feeling. I’ve always been what I’d describe as emotionally weak, easily falling into depression and being anxious is common. Now I don’t normally remember my dreams too much I mean it changes sometime I remember one every month or one every couple days but that’s rare. Every time I’ve fallen asleep starting from the night before my troubles I’ve have vivid dreams. These dreams change every time and although some seem a little stressing they generally aren’t and aren’t nightmarish in anyway. Does the reoccurring vivid dreams happen to anyone else?
NotSignal	Y'know i thought that now im in quarantine I'd be able to sleep and rest , but noooope , ive been in quarantine for over a month now and i havent had a single good night's sleep , before i used to have just 1-2 sleepless nights a week yet now no matter how hard i try to sleep i just can't, on top of that, im a very light sleeper in a noisy house , im lucky if i get 4 hours of sleep without waking up once or twice , anyone else feel the same these days?
NotSignal	Does anyone else get these weird shock sensations? Like ill be TRYING to fall asleep but my brain keeps feeling like its getting shocked or zapped for long periods of time. Like i was awake and asleep at the same time. I was also dreaming too which was weird. I was attempting to fall asleep but I just couldnt. i was scared of the shocking feeling. I kept fighting the sleep because I thought something would happen because my brain literally felt like it was being fried.Does anyone know what this could be? Is it normal?
NotSignal	Been using cannabis with success the last 3 yrs to fall asleep. Still works fine BUT now for the last 3 months I wake up at 2:00 am and struggle badly to get back to sleep ! I use edibles. I’ve tried vaping indica at 2:00 am but doesn’t t seem to work let at bedtime.Last night vaped cbd at 2:00 am and was really released but still could t fall asleep .Advice anyone?? G
Signal	Sorry for the rant fellas, extremely sleep deprived atm and not thinking clearlySo basically, a week ago I had this bad cold that cost me a couple of nights of sleep, and I decided to buy a bottle of melatonin gummies to help with sleep. These gummies have 0.5mg of melatonin in them, btw. So for the past two nights, I popped one gummy 20 mins before bed, worked like a charm, went to sleep 20 mins after my head hit the pillow. But, yesterday I was feeling much better, and I decided I'd try a night without melatonin; I didn't take one before bed, and I got NO SLEEP. I tossed and turned in bed, felt the hallucination-y feeling of almost drifting off. Did all that I could, got out of bed, went for a walk down my dorm hallway to the bathroom, got water, all that goody-goody. I totally avoided my phone screen, even with the night filter on, possibly spent a total of 5 minutes on it the whole night.&#x200B;I was very comfortable - my fan was going, room was a comfy cool temperature, I'd showered and everything.&#x200B;All this for nothing. At \~5:30 am, I think I drifted off to sleep for about 30 minutes before waking up at 6:30, and again at 7:30-8:30, then I had to go to class.&#x200B;Keep in mind, for 95% of the school year my sleep is fine; I'd go to bed at like 1, watch youtube or hulu or whatever, even without the blue light filter, and turn off the phone when the hand I used to hold the phone kept dropping it due to exhaustion; this worked for me all year.&#x200B;I feel like I've practiced good sleep hygiene, is this because I'm feeling melatonin withdrawal? Is the whole thing a placebo? Idk what to do and im going insane
NotSignal	What does it mean if I remember my dreams every night they are not vivid dreams where I know I am dreaming. But I dream every night and can recall what my dreams where about I feel it’s kinda weird because most people I talk so don’t remember their dreams but I do I this concerning is this weird? Do you only dream during REM sleep? If so do I get to much REM sleep does anyone have onsite on what it means is flying can recall your dreams every night bits and pieces of what they are about?
Signal	Not exactly sure if this is the best place to talk about this, but i've (30m) feared this happening awhile because of my insomnia and medications.I was waiting for my sister to arrive at my house for a couple of hours, and when i got bored and tired, i went to check her room, and she was already sleeping, and just then did i remember that she had already arrived and i was also talking to her a couple hours ago. That's just pretty crazy to forget.My memory has never been this bad.We do have a history of dementia in our family. I've also been taking diphenhydramine and doxylamine a lot for a long time. Insomnia is so bad some days i get 0-3 hours sleep, at it's worse, 3 days without sleep. Was supposed to take Diphenhydramine tonight but deciding not to.I'm a little scared tbh.
NotSignal	Since the quarantine because of the COVID-19 I'm having some slepless nights, the greatest problem is the inconsistence in my sleep pattern sometimes I fall asleep at 7:00 PM and wake up at 1:30 AM and on the other day I sleep 4:00 AM and wake up at noon I think the problem is the lack of social interaction that used to tire me out since I'm an introvert like college and my internship any tips on how to fix my sleep schedule? Thanks for reading.
Signal	Been trying this for 4 nights with “meh” results. Please, those who’ve had success - any advice?I’ve typically went to bed during this period of heightened panic and anxiety around 11 and awoke at 3 then in/out till 6-7 with a total of 5-6 hours. It was frustrating so melatonin and Benadryl became my go to for a week but now trying sleep restriction. I now lay down around 12 and fall asleep by 12:30 and up either at 3-4 and again toss/turn till 6 getting 4.5-5.5 hours of sleep. It makes my anxiety and stress worse. I’ve considered A. Keep going w/ restriction B. Take some old (out of date by a few months) temazepam pills for a week to see if it resets circadian C try melatonin and Benadryl again It’s so difficult the waking at 3 has been going on for 6 months and has helped exhaust my body and raise sensitivity to panic and anxiety.
NotSignal	Just curious if most people know why they have insomnia and then work on changing that habit. My body all the sudden doesn’t like to go to sleep. I have mild adhd so I usually can’t sleep if I don’t workout in some way but this week has been different. I was up til 6am and didn’t feel sleepy at all. I ended up sleeping for 3 hours...
NotSignal	I get so annoyed when my husband just falls asleep in 5 minutes. We lay down and his breathing just slows and he’s off to dreamland. He has no trouble at all. I didn’t sleep all night, he slept like a baby. Now it’s noon the next day, we had lunch and he’s napping like a damn angel and I wanna slap him awake. Is sleep jealousy a thing? Is his peaceful sleep keeping me more awake? I wonder if I was with another insomniac maybe I’d be sleeping better because my brain does the opposite effect. Ugh I can’t even see anymore. So tired.
Signal	My insomnia is on an off terrible; during good times with less stress I can fall asleep in between 1.5hrs to 2.5hrs, during bad times it can be between 3hrs and 5hrs, it doesnt matter how tired I am. What remains constant was the anxiety of going to bed, not falling asleep. I am able to have short naps or sleep in slightly less comfortable places than a bed in about 45 minutes, but the idea of going to bed to fall sleep worsens everything.When this anxiety is there I often get anxiety and panic attacks which make it take longer to fall asleep. My attacks aren't cognitive though, I get severe neck pain and sometimes headaches or back pain that through therapy I've discovered is how panic and anxiety attacks present themselves to me. For the past 2 weeks or so I've been trying to meditate to control these issues. I sometimes meditate in the day, but always meditate before bed. It didn't happen over night but for about a week now I havent gotten this pain at all. As I'm in a low stress period it's been taking me only 1.5hrs to fall asleep! Its not the fastest of course but it's better than it has been and with the lack of panic attacks I am feeling so much better. I'm going to continue meditating to improve my sleep, perhaps one day instead of just controlling my bedtime anxiety I'll be able to fall asleep normally as well!
NotSignal	I had community college classes this morning that I could not miss at 9am. I laid down at 2am, but I ended up laying in bed awake until literally 7am. When I finally did fall asleep, it was so deep I slept through my four alarms spaced 2 minutes apart. Just woke up. rest in peace
Signal	I've been struggling with severe insomnia for the past 8 months. Prior to all this, I've had temporary bouts with insomnia, but it'd always resolve within a week or so. I think what makes my insomnia complex is that I started suffering from throbbing migraines when lying down (regardless of sleep position), been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea, and suffer from generalized anxiety. I've always had generalized anxiety but it's hard to say if the migraines are a byproduct of the sleep deprivation or a cause of the insomnia - either way it's a vicious cycle.Lately, I'll go a night or two unable to achieve any sleep and on the following night, my body's need for sleep overcomes the insomnia temporarily and I'll be able to get between 4-7 hours of sleep before the horrific sleeplessness cycle continues. I believe I've been doing all the right things with sleep hygiene, CBTI, etc. and I don't think I have any specific stressors or anxiety inducers that are to blame but the lack of sleep has made me develop sleep anxiety. I start to get a little anxious as evening rolls in and if I can't fall asleep within 15 min or so, I start to get restless and panicky that I will have another sleepless night. . . and that's usually what happens, a sleepless night. I'm currently taking 600 mg Gabapentin and between 12.5 mg - 25 mg Seroquel but whereas these medications worked somewhat before to make me drowsy and/or dizzy to want to lie down, I don't think they're really working anymore. I do have a benzo and Ambien prescription but really have been avoiding using them reguarly, maybe once every couple weeks or once a month.My body, mind, and spirit feel so broken and dejected after a sleepless night and it's hard to concentrate and function at work the next day but somehow I manage to make it through, albeit very, very difficult. My spouse tries to be as supportive as possible but not going through it firsthand, it's difficult to relate in a lot of ways. I just hope that I can overcome this as operating in zombie mode more days out of the week than not doesn't seem sustainable in the long run.I've tried various apps such as whitenoise, sleep stories, etc. but it's hard avoiding seeing the time on my phone when I'm turning on/off the apps or toggling between them in the middle of the night and I think I'm so hyperaroused at times they don't even work regularly - it's only on those nights my body's need for sleep overcomes the insomnia that it somewhat helps drown out other noises present around me. I don't even think there's really a response needed to my post, but I just wanted to put my thoughts down and hopefully find solace in knowing that I'm not alone.
Signal	Doctor recently started me on the medication doxepin for sleep (50mg at night so far); I also take some other medications that may affect how the doxepin is metabolized such as Paxil.I’m wondering if anyone has any experience of using doxepin as a sleep aid? If you do how was it for you? What dose worked best for you?I only started it maybe 7 days ago? But so far I’m still waking up with a really bad hangover every morning. And, I’m someone whose used to sleep aids / like seroquel doesn’t make me hungover like this ever. Is it gonna stay this way?
Signal	I write this post at 3:35AM local time. This is my fourth night in a row of either no or minimal sleep. Last night I got 2 hours. The night before I get 3. Night before that I got no sleep. I've been an insomniac for many years and I've largely adjusted to operating on very little sleep, but I feel awful. But here's the twist. I also have epilepsy. This makes the situation worse in two different ways. 1) sleep deprivation is VERY bad for me and can cause a relapse into seizures and 2) my anticonvulsants mean that I can't take just about every sleeping pill out there because of interaction. Melatonin does nothing for me and CBD is largely bullshit (trust me, I'm a scientist and this is my area of specialty, check my post history for some hot takes if you wish). Given the fact I have a fairly high mental demand job, sleep deprivation means I can't perform well at all at work and it's getting frustrating. My supervisor understands because I've told her about my health problems but I still feel so bad about it. My girlfriend also understands, but is frustrated because my tossing and turning keeps her up. I'm sitting on my loveseat right now, which is unfortunately too small for my 6'2" self to sleep on. I don't know what to do. I've consulted my neurologist about it and he's said it's likely a side effect of my medication or my epilepsy in general. I've tried everything. I've gone to 3 different therapists, tried every diet and workout schedule known to man and nothing works. Medications are of very limited use to me. I just wanted to get this out.
Signal	I’ve been taking trazadone 50mg at bed time for about a month. I noticed I am retaining a lot of water and my skin is breaking out a lot too (not menstrual cycle related ... that came and went without problem earlier this month). Did anyone else get bloated/gain weight?
NotSignal	I am shaking with pain and fear at this point. I physically allow my body to relax. I am so scared. I am a shell of a person. I don’t know how to break the cycle.
Signal	So again I cant fall asleep. Just took another generic unisom. Can my body forget how to fall asleep on its own?? I don't know what's causing this recent bout of insomnia. I am stressed and anxious sure but I'm always stressed and anxious so what gives ?
NotSignal	I've noticed after taking it for a few weeks it doesn't work anymore, but if I take a break from it and then start up again it will work again. Just wondering if other people have experienced that?
NotSignal	I woke up with a sore throat yesterday and today it was a bad headache and I ended up barfing. I'm so concerned it's COVID and I'm fixated on my breathing. I keep testing myself and I don't really feel short of breath, but every time I try to sleep I get woken up by anxiety. I need rest but I'm scared and don't know what to do to get myself to sleep. It's 6 am now.
NotSignal	Hi guys, I have hypothyroidism and for most part it's no issue for me to fall and stay asleep.Lately in the past weeks I've been waking up earlier and earlier. For most part I just use the extra hours to exercise. Not much changes to my diet but I've been eating healthier. There some stressful events that has happened to me about 5 weeks ago. In the last week Ive awoken 3 to 4 hours into my sleep with severe heart palpitations. I don't know if this is biological or psychological. My specialist has taken my blood samples for examinations. Fingers crossed its nothing serious.Anyone with a similar experience?
Signal	Hi y'all. It's 1AM here in Philippine time and I'm waiting for the sleeping pill I took to kick in.Recently, I've been getting too scared to sleep along with my overall fear of the dark. It's mostly the part where I have bad dreams (or is it considered a night terror?) in the recent nights that's making me don't want to sleep. Worst part I can clearly remember what's going on in the dream and will randomly remember it while trying to sleep.A lot of my bad dreams revolve around personal life (though there have been no dreams related to that lately) or a weirdly specific dreams about gaming. It's either:• Kid-friendly games that I always enjoy but there's something wrong in the game (ex: there are two horses in Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town and they are both hostile to your character and try to actively kill you despite having high affection points)• Some sort of Augmented reality game where I'm literally in the occasionally non-existent game (ex: I'm trying to escort the mascot character "Froggy," who looks like the Duck Hunt dog but faded, to the airport when the escalators are filled with rabid adult fans of "Froggy." As "Froggy" tried to go down the escalator, my vision alternates with an R2D2 lookalike being shredded by a wall of blades and "Froggy" being eating alive from the fans)• Playing a game in my laptop but the way how it's set up, it like the laptop screen is in your face. (Ex: Third person shooter where I have to keep two scary women away from my character or else every time they touch my character the jumpscare pic with flash for a split second and will fully be there when they both got my character)I don't know if it's because of my gaming habits or the current state of the country I'd like some advice on how to go to sleep without fear of a bad dream. Or for something silly, I'd like to influence my dreams to be whatever I want it to be horny. As in this time, if we can't hug and touch people in real life, might as well do it in our dreams.Feeling the sleeping pill kick in so I'll check this in the morning. It's 1:35 AM by the time I wrote this line. See y'all tomorrow
NotSignal	So basically like all fall asleep and have what feels like a full length dream only to wake up and see that it's only been about 15minutes since I've fallen asleep. I'll then go back to sleep after about 5-10minutes and basically just keep rinsing and repeating this cycle for 2-3hrs at which point I cant fall back asleep again.
Signal	I was having very bad insomnia caused by tremendous workload from my studies and it lasted for about 1 and a half month. Initially it was so bad, I only had 3 hours of sleep for 3 nights. Now, I feel I have recovered from it as I had almost 10 hours of sleep every night for the past 3 nights. These are the things I did: 1: Reduce workload, took a semester break from school because it was getting so bad and affecting my mental health.&#x200B;2: Stop searching online for solution about insomnia.. this actually makes you more anxious about the night ahead. &#x200B;3: Zopiclone sleeping pills. I went to a doctor and he prescribed me with 4 weeks of zopiclone (non-benzo). First 2 weeks, taking it regularly every night before bedtime and next 2 weeks taking as needed. (I stopped at the 3rd week) &#x200B;4: Treating my insomnia as a signal from the brain. Telling myself that there was nothing wrong with me, and everything will be fine soon. I had to constantly remind myself throughout the day to get rid of the negative thoughts that were clouding my head. &#x200B;Hope this helps! Things will get better slowly but surely :)
NotSignal	After having never slept over 4 hours a night since the start of March, I FINALLY slept 6 hours last night!!!!!!!
Signal	Hey new to this subreddit. Before I dive in, I wanna say I've been dealing with sleep issues ever since I was a teenager. I'm trying to get my sleep hygiene in check by going to bed at around the same time, taking melatonin and magnesium supplements, not eating or drinking a few hours before bed, etc. I've always woken up in the middle of the night but never as badly as most recently. Here's how last night went: I hop in bed at 2 AM, fall asleep around 3 AM, wake up at 5:45 AM, stay up until 8 AM wide awake, and eventually give up and start my day. Now I mainly blame myself for having such poor sleep because before my 2AM cutoff, I went to bed around 3-4:30 AM and eventually getting out of bed around noon. Still, I had 6+ hours of sleep and it was never too much of an issue except for the daytime grogginess. I was thinking of hopping on trazodone since I hear great things about it.&#x200B;tl;dr **I can't stay asleep for more than 2 hours at a time. I need a better routine.**
Signal	Like I never sleep anyway but I alwase get realy mad and like hit my pillows like wtf sorry pillow I know it not ur fault.
NotSignal	I have to get up for work in about four hours but my brain is going all over the place. Not even my meds worked tonight. I don't want to go to work bc I hate that. But the reason my brain is all over the place is work. It's just too much and its messing everything up.
NotSignal	I don't know if anyone else notices this but it seems one little thought or feeling is enough to wreck you from a good nights rest. This means that the intensity of your anxiety and stress, even if it's not coming on all that strong, is enough to keep you up for hours on end. My body could feel calm, my mind quiet, but something in the back of my subconscious does not let me feel safe enough or let go of the fixation on when I will fall asleep. The moment I start to doze off, I will wake back up again, aware that I was falling asleep. Soon enough the early morning hours have dawned upon me and I find myself not even able to doze off anymore until I just suddenly pass out for some reason, getting my 3-5 hours of sleep.
NotSignal	Every time I lay down for bed, hypnic jerk interferes for 3 hours. This has happen for two nights. What should I do?
Signal	I am not tired. And I know why, I drank 4 cups of Expresso within the past 4 hours. I would love to be asleep right now. But I am wide awake, as if it's 12 or 1pm and bright and sunny outside. I am so frustrated I would absolutely LOVE to be asleep right now. I think the best days are when I get a peaceful rest the night before. It just kind of messes up my schedule. Because than I'm tired around lunch time, gosh! I just really wanted to drink some coffee and enjoy it. I'm paying for it. I'm sorry to self!
NotSignal	I keep waking up at 4-5am having to pee, even tho I pee right before I go to sleep. Then, even if I do pee, I get in bed and wake up every 30 minutes or so. What should I do?
NotSignal	I went several years with no sleep. I dont care if people say its impossible. Medical anomalies happen. Anyway for some reason when I was put on Invega( a antipsychotic) it allowed me to be able to sleep. Im not psychotic just used this med as an off chance to help with mood issues. Anyway sleep is started to taper down again. I had a good run. Almost 4 years with sleep.
NotSignal	I’ve never had sleep problems in the past and have always been able to sleep with ease but recently I’ve been unable to sleep at all. I’ve posted previously about some problems I was having but I’m now approaching my third night without sleep.I’m 18 and for the past few days I’ve not been able to fall asleep, I just end up laying there without any results even if I spend up to 20mins with my eyes closed. I’m beginning to get fearful something bad will happen to me,Is there anything I can do? I can’t force myself to sleep no matter what I try and I’m not feeling tired.
NotSignal	Feels like a tiny headache. It’s like there is something moving in my brain and i end up opening my eyes quickly. Only happens at night.
NotSignal	Information comes from my experiences and my doctors (New England in USA). I realized this information could help some people, so I'm looking for places to talk about it. I hope this is the right place. Non-24 is a condition where the body clock isn't regulated by light the way it usually is. It's a very common condition in completely blind people, and is only diagnosed in that group. HOWEVER, I've been told by multiple doctors that it isn't about whether or not your eyes perceive light. It's actually a certain set of nerves which detect and signal your brain of this light. Because of this, anyone with a neurological problem with the eyes, optic nerves, or brain could have non-24! LIst of neurological disorder that affect the brain, optic nerves, or eyes and therefore MIGHT make non-24 possible even if you have some or full vision. \- Optic Nerve Hypoplasia (my condition) \- Nystagmus (shaking of the eyes) \- amblyopia or strabismus (lazy eye) (This ISN'T always neurological but can be) \- Seizure disorders \- Brain malformations \- Diabetes related eye problems \- Peripheral Neuropathy \- Brain or eye tumors \- Macular degeneration \- Cortical Visual Impairment \- Learning disabilities \- Autism \- Sensory Processing Disorder \- Stroke or Aneurisms And many many more! None of these have been PROVEN to cause insomnia however. Please consult a doctor with chronic insomnia symptoms as it can be a sign of something more serious. That said, if you have chronic insomnia and a neurological condition, I'd suggest talking to a neurologist. If you're having signs of Non-24, consider training your body by creating a night routine that will tell your body clock it's time for bed when the sunset can't. You may also try melatonin, sleepy time tea, certain scents, and other natural ways of telling your body it's time for sleep. I was trained by a combination of these things plus was on a mild sedative at night for about 5 years as a child since I was only able to sleep a few hours a night and wasn't functioning well at school. This of course needs to be prescribed by a medical professional. Sometimes if my body clock has been thrown off in a major way (as in I'm falling asleep at 5am when I leave for work at 5:30am), I have (with my doctor's approval) used nyquil or benadryl for 1-3 nights to force my body to get used to falling asleep at a better time again. With all the other methods, I only need to do this a few times a year. Consult a doctor before doing this as it isn't the usual use for the drug. Therapy and anxiety medication has also helped a ton. Of course this needs a prescription from a professional. I hope this helps someone! <3 Feel free to ask questions!TLDR; If you have a neurological condition and insomnia, that's totally to be expected and it's treatable!
NotSignal	Literally staying awake for two nights in a row was by far the longest time for me and I regretted every minute.Fortunately I managed to finish everything on time but damn, when I finally hit the bed, I didn't manage to fall asleep until like 3am, it's crazy😓
NotSignal	Stay up for another 6 hours before going to work, or try to sleep for the next 4 hours and only getting 2 hours of sleep which makes me feel worse.
NotSignal	Has anyone else had their insomnia ramp up during this “shelter in place” protocol? I know that stress and the deepening of my depression is a huge factor, but being home nearly 24-7 and having flexible schedule is really messing me up. Anybody else? Any tips that you are finding helpful?
NotSignal	I would be laying and I kind of think I am sleeping but damn it's the lightest sleep ever. Like I can hear all the outside noises, everything that's going on, but my mind still makes me think that I am sleeping and it also shows me scenarios almost like I am dreaming. I hate it. It's the worst kind of sleep.
NotSignal	The night before I slept almost 6 hours straight and last night 5 hours straight hopefully it keeps this way
NotSignal	i can’t do this anymore. i feel like this is slowly killing me. i feel like i’ve tried everything. what did we do to deserve this?
NotSignal	Can it actually help with HPA axis dysfunction/adrenal fatigue type of insomnia?i wake up every one or almost two cycle and cant typically fall back asleep after 3am, i was recommended this technique.
NotSignal	I wasn’t able to sleep for 3 days but I got a 2 hour nap yesterday and a 3 hour nap a few hours later.I woke up at 2 am and right now it’s 2 PM. Should I stay awake until tonight and possibly not sleep again or try sleep now?
Signal	Hello everyone. I've been a daily user of Ambien for the last 9 months. It used to work in 30 minutes initially, but takes 2-3 hours now. Still I am unable to go to sleep without it. I tried a couple of nights, but kept drifting in and out of light sleep with weird dreams. What's a good approach to reduce dependency on sleep meds?
Signal	So I've posted on here about trying out a lot of different things. I have problems both with sleep onset and maintenance but more with onset. When I was a teen, I had a lot of problems with RLS. Before I ever started taking medications, my sleep was so bad that I was getting about 3 hours one night and 0 the next night in an alternating pattern plus falling asleep occasionally in not so safe places.Lunesta worked great for me in putting me out pretty much immediately but I was struggling with waking up super alert around 3 AM and unable to go back to sleep unless I took Lunesta again. Over the weeks that I took Lunesta, I realized that my muscles were shaking-- not so much in a spasmodic way but slight trembling as if they were super fatigued. Melatonin also tends to cause early morning wakeups for me. After doing some more research, I found that Melatonin is possibly linked to making RLS symptoms worse. Last night, I just took l theanine and 0.25 mg klonopin. I wasn't knocked out like I was with Lunesta but I only woke up two times and was able to go back to sleep and ended up sleeping seven hours (which is a lot for me). And I don't feel like my muscles are trembling as much today. Honestly, I feel like I could get the same results with just l theanine. I've had to stop taking magnesium as this was making me wake up to pee too many times during the night. So if you're having problems with sleep onset and taking anything (even melatonin) that then causes problems with sleep maintenance that you haven't had before, it might be causing RLS during the early morning that's waking you up. If that's the case, I have found l theanine to be much better at making me feel sleepy than melatonin and it helps my muscles relax too. Of course, YMMV.
Signal	Occasionally at night, I wake up about an hour after falling asleep, give or take. It used to make me really frustrated, especially if I wanted to get up early; but now it doesn’t bother me too much. I have a routine to just get up, take a bath, and just chill out for a bit.The most unpleasant part about it though is that I wake up with a wave of depersonalization, more severe than what I ever deal with in the daytime. In the past, I had to deal with DP/DR on a usual basis, but changing my daily habits and practicing mindful meditation, mindfulness in general if I might add, has absolutely helped me make progress with that, and with my anxiety in general. I really don’t notice it anymore throughout the day.Part of the reason why I have trouble falling and staying asleep is probably because of the altered state of simply being asleep. Waking up and not being FULLY sure who I am for a moment is strange. I wake up and feel weird sitting in my own body, which of course invites thoughts of the panicky and existential variety. Regular old DP shit, the works haha.I’m definitely not a chronic sufferer of insomnia (and I definitely do not hope to become one!) For some reason, it’s just been brought on recently. Every few nights or so I’ll wake up just feeling out of it. I’m wondering if you guys get the same thing sometimes, and how you cope with it? The routine I explained earlier definitely helps me, especially just telling myself “yeah, I am awake right now, no harm done” and just getting up without thinking twice about it to get on my routine. I guess you could call that mindfulness to a certain extent, just getting my mind on track instead of going through the mental motions and feeding into the anxious, depersonalized thoughts. Once I get to and get in THE BAAATH and occupy myself, it already gets me in a more focused headspace, with no cloudy feeling. Just generally sleepy and chill.Never usually in the headspace to get up and start meditating immediately though. Sometimes anxiety can feel so overwhelming it sort of freezes you, in a way. By instinct wanna just distract yourself and do something that makes you feel good, instead of sitting DEEPER into those feelings. You know what I mean?I dunno. Not exactly begging for advice. Just wondering if you guys ever wake up with depersonalization or derealization, and how you’ve coped with it. It’s a real bitch and can be pretty scary, especially in this day in age where there’s waaaay too little of a focus on nature. Anyways, sleep well ;)
Signal	I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'm kinda sleep deprived at the moment (aren't we all?) but I'm kinda desperate for help and I don't know what to do. I'm 18 years old. I don't smoke or drink. I also don't drink coffee in case you were wondering. Basically, I never had problems sleeping before. I could fall asleep within minutes of hitting the bed, at any time, at any place. However, that changed a week ago. I woke up suddenly at 4Am in the morning thirsty AF, drank some water and went back to bed. However, I couldn't fall asleep. I spent the entire night rolling in my bed until morning and basically had the shittiest day of my life. However, I decided not to sleep during the day and just carry on with my day the best I could and I hoped that I would get the sleep I needed during the night. Well, that didn't happen. The days that followed were not what I expected at all. I took hours to fall asleep and when I finally did fall asleep, the slightest of noises would wake me up and had a lot of interruptions. Everytime I felt myself fall asleep, I would also wake up and then take another 50 years to fall asleep. I'm sorry if I'm being dramatic. I've read some posts around here and some of you clearly have more troubles than me for which you have my sympathy but I'm not used to this and I fear that this is what my life is going to be. I'm actually afraid of going to bed now since I know that I probably won't sleep and if I do, it will take forever only to wake up 2-3 hours later. I don't understand this! Ive never been so tired my entire life yet I can't for the life of me fall asleep. I tried talking to my parents because of this and they completely dismissed me and I have nowhere to turn anymore. I feel like a zombie and the worst of all, I have a very important exam next Monday. I don't see how I'm going to study now.If anyone can offer any insight into this, please leave a comment. I can't take this torture anymore. I refuse to believe what my life has become.
Signal	I've been having trouble with just not being tired recently. it started off being manageable with some melatonin. but in the course of about a month and a half i went from 2.5mg of melatonin a night to 10mg a night. but it seems like 10mg has stopped working (hence why I am posting this at 6am). last night after being awake for 36 hours, I took some Doxylamine Sleep Aid (half a pill) and passed out about 2 hours later. I woke up once but ultimately slept for 10 hours. But I read that taking over the counter sleep meds for long periods of time is actually bad? I'm really worried because I have a neuromuscular disease and can't take meds that cause respiratory depression, which I'm told most prescription sleep meds do. Im really worried because the way I am now, I genuinely don't think I will ever sleep without being medicated. I just don't feel tired ever and it seems to be getting worse quick. literally 2 months ago I had a perfect circadian rhythm with 8 hours every night. I have anxiety and am a really bad hypochondriac so I am scared of Fatal Insomnia even though I know it's highly unlikely. im planning on talking to my doctor when they open today
NotSignal	todays been rough. tonights gonna be rough. nobody to talk to, not tired yet, very stressed. i wish i could freeze time. this month is gonna be packed with good and bad events, way more than im used to. its hard to handle it all. i wish i could lay in bed and knock out like everyone else i know can. i dont think the 2 hours of sleep i got last night helped with my stressful day, even if im used to almost no sleep by now. i just wanna sleep, but i cant. if anyone wanna chat id be up for that but i might try to sleep again in a minute
Signal	Hi all, I have literally just joined this page..typing this at 2am of course.Now I'm fully new to the word insomnia let alone what it actually is, Last 3 months I've been told to keep a sleep diary (Would be far easier if I got any) I've tried to steer clear of Google because I don't want to fit symptoms to myself if that makes sense? what I struggle with is getting to sleep, I can be absolutely shattered and the minute I close my eyes I'm wide awake. possibly manage an hour a night, extremely rarely 4 hours . I've had to quit my job, My relationship is being affected as is my parenting.someone in this sub must have some advice for me? Is this insomnia? Am I over reacting? I am so mentally exhausted it's ridiculous. my GP is 0 help at all.
Signal	Bruuuuh, there is so much stress in my life right now and it is putting my head into overdrive, my insomnia is almost at it worse it’s ever been and honestly I think I’ve just gotten to that point where your so unable to cope with it that you just sink in and except it, like the best way to describe it is like floating through everything, ignoring everything just to the point you’re numb and shit, its gotten so bad now that I’ve resulted back to smoking the greeeeen to get me into a state where I can get even a couple hours in. It’s so fucking hopeless like everything is like a knock on effect, and I’m just drifting cause I just can’t do anything. I dunno if it’s like this for anyone else but that whole “floating through” thing is probably the only thing allowing me to get through. Bruuuuh i am straight up nummmmbbb
NotSignal	Hey guys I have terrible anxiety induced insomnia. I read ACT books. Which keep you in bed. Then I’ve read about CBTi which makes you get out of bed in 15 minutes and go back again. And repeat until you sleep. Does CBTi work for anxiety induced insomnia? Or are you better off staying in bed and trying to ride out the anxiety wave ? Thanks !
Signal	up until i was like 21 or so, i could nap and sleep just fine the same day.&#x200B;then i messed up my lifestyle by staying up until 3-4 am, drinking coffee several times a day, and now i can't remember the last time i was able to sleep for more than 2-3 hours.
NotSignal	I tried sobriety and I'm done with a year of 2 hour average nightly sleep which forced me to this forum.So fuck it, I'm going back to what I did before and live a happy productive life:Sunday night: weekend is over and I know I need to be fresh. Hit the xans. 1 to 2mg supplemented by trazadone as necessary. 8 hours sleep. Monday night: Gaba A receptors need a rest. Hit the mary Jane. Indica is best. Supplement with beer so I don't fly off into active brain land high. 6 to 8 hours sleep.Tuesday Night: Get an early night. Blast my brain with mirtazapine at 8pm. Make sure to have coffee ready for the morn. 8 to 10 hour sleep.Wednesday night: Time to give my opioid receptors a treat and take the edge off midweek. Crack out the Kratom. Start early evening until I drift away.....6 hour sleepThursday night: nearly end of week. I could have another mirtazapine or maybe I will give my gaba b receptors a work out with some phenibut. Or if I REALLY want to sleep, some seroquel. 8 hours sleep.Friday night: Yes, I made it through another work week,a productive member of society. I will TAKE ABSOLUTELY nothing tonight, Maybe I will go out and all will be amazed at my energy and ability to keep going to the early morning (and beyond). Or maybe I will write a novel. Saturday night: Maybe I did or maybe I didn't get sleep last night. No worries, today is a fasting day. I am starving my brain until it gives up and craves for sleep. About 11pm I will give it a light snack so I don't get fasting insomnia. As the blood rushes to my stomach I can feel my body give way and.....3 to 6 hours sleep.Sunday: repeat cycle.It worked for me before. The key is to never build tolerance. Feel free to supplement along the way with magnesium and L theanine.
Signal	So I have had insomnia since I was a child. I barely slept due to my mother going through manic stages at night. I also had digestive issues with malnutrition that caused severe RLS and muscle cramping (Charley horses). I totally disregarded my sleep in my early 20s and had a tough time sleeping on a demanding schedule. In my mid 20s, I worked online and traveled a lot for fun and slept amazingly well. In my late 20s, I had a lot of stress in my life and my anxiety worsened. Right now, I'm doing well with anxiety. However, as I peel back layers causing my insomnia, I encounter other factors that contributed to my childhood-onset insomnia. Right now, I'm having problems with RLS. As a teenager, this affected my sleep so bad that I would kick my legs into my mattress until they were numb so I could finally sleep. I'm trying to work with my GP right now instead of a psychiatrist as I have found that more helpful. I know that benzos do well for muscle relaxers, but I have had problems with short-acting benzos/non-benzos because I process these so fast that they shorten my sleep cycle.I have taken Flexeril in the past but hated the feeling. I just felt numb instead of relaxed. I've also been looking into magnesium and potassium supplements. These help some but I feel like I need something a bit stronger sometimes. I've slept the best after swimming in the ocean on vacation for a while (magnesium) and I've tried to replicate this with epsom salts in the bath. Walking doesn't seem to help the RLS symptoms that much either.Any suggestions for things to suggest to my GP? I feel like I know more about insomnia than most medical providers and I have to present them with a "case" for them to consider. Some things I'm seeing for possible anticonvulsants (if this is the right category) are baclofen and gabapentin. Anyone have experience with this?
NotSignal	Idk if any1 experiencing this but some days my insomnia is jus like hey buddy today we finna stay up and other days it’s like hey buddy I’m tried go to sleep like tf it’s so dumb sometimes it could be stayin for more more than 2 days other days it could be gone in one day I’m so confused on if this is insomnia or some other random shit like some days I get 2 hours of sleep other days I get 7 but most days it takes me 2+ hours to fall asleep. Any1 know?
Signal	Every night I used to dread bedtime. Going to sleep felt like I was fighting a war with my brain. I would sit in bed four hours with racing thoughts. Some periods it would get so bad that I was up for 4-5 hours a night before I finally fell asleep. I would then proceed to wake up around noon, and I would be frustrated; I had lost half of my day. At times I felt hopeless. I felt like I was never going to be able to get past my difficulties with insomnia, but finally, I created a system that allows me to fall asleep in less than five minutes (I wear a sleep tracking ring called an Oura ring that has confirmed this for me).*To preface this, I don’t think I ever had serious insomnia in the sense that something was chemically wrong with me. My insomnia was caused by mental anxiety and bad mental loops that would keep me awake. Breaking these mental loops and anxieties did crazy wonders for my sleep.***My system is built around 14 rules (most important rules have a ☆):**1) ☆ Your bedroom is for rest and rest only. Do not do work in your bedroom. Do not pace in your bedroom and think. Do not take phone calls in your bedroom. You should under no conditions take your phone out in your bedroom unless you are setting an alarm. Whenever you are in your bedroom, you should not think. By not thinking, I mean that you should literally not think past what you are doing; simply concentrate on what you are doing. 2) keep a clean bedroom. I have noticed a clean bedroom = a clean mind3) ☆ Go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning.4) ☆ When you wake up, hop right out of bed. Do not sit in the bed and linger5) ☆ two hours before bed, stop using all technology, dim lights, and don’t do work. This is incredibly crucial. Technology engages us too much and makes our minds race.6) ☆ one hour before bed, stop thinking about random things. Only focus on what you are doing.So, say you want to go to bed at 11, then stop using technology at 9. This includes TV, cell phones iPads, etc… At 10, start preparing for bed. I shower in this time period, brush my teeth, get into bed-wear, etc... While doing all of this, I do not think about anything but what I am doing. Once I am ready, I hop into bed and grab a FICTION book (nonfiction makes us think too much). I read for several minutes until I start to feel sleepy, and then I put the book down. You should be aiming to try to go to sleep within a 15 minute window every night (10:45 to 11:00 in my case). If you are starting to fall asleep earlier or later than that, then that is a problem and you either need to adjust your behavior or your bedtime.7) ☆ this is the most crucial rule, and the most effective strategy I have found to fall asleep. Once you are laying down and ready to go to sleep, focus all of your mental energy on your breathe. Breathe in… and then breathe out… breathe in… and breathe out… This is essentially meditation, but doing this at night time will allow you to fall asleep. Trust that if you do this, you will fall asleep.8) ☆ there will be nights when this strategy does not seem to work. Just concentrate on breathing and have faith that it will work out.9) When laying down in bed, have one sleeping position and maintain it for the whole night. I sleep on my back with my arms on my legs.10) do not eat food (ideally) past eight. If this is impossible, avoid eating it later than two hours before bed under normal circumstances. (Food includes any drink with calories or any drink that normally would have calories so its diet. Limit yourself to tea and water past 8)11) Do not drink coffee past seven hours before bedtime12) Sleep in a cool environment.13) Make the room as dark as possible (but also allow some outside light to come in during the morning so your body starts the wake up process once light hits it)14) Get eight hours of sleep\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Once you have this strategy mastered, you can break some rules for special reasons. For example, when I party I obviously don’t follow all of these rules, but I am still able to go to bed fast as long as I do the breath-work. What I’ve found is that when I fully use this strategy 5 out of 7 nights a week it works fine. Anything more than that and I have problems.CANT FALL ASLEEP LAST RESORT:Once in a rare while, you will not be able to fall asleep. In order to remedy this, go into the shower. Turn the water onto as cold as it will go, and then shower for five minutes. Once you are done, you will be very ready to go to bed. (This may seem counterintuitive but it works). This method is centrally modeled on something called cognitive behavioral therapy which is a groundbreaking solution to a lot of mental issues like insomnia, OCD, depression, social anxiety, and much more. I definitely recommend looking into it if you have difficulties with any of these problems (you will have to see a therapist to have them give you cognitive behavioral therapy, but if you experience mild versions of these things, you can self-administer it).
NotSignal	I just spent 3500 bucks on a new mattress!!!! It won’t be here until November but I can’t wait hopefully my broken sleep days are behind me!! Weed has been helping tremendously but at the end of the day my current mattress is 10 years old and extremely sunken in, not to mention it was my grandmas then my mother’s than mine (all in the span on 10-14ish years.) I’m so excited I got the Sealy silver chill hybrid in a firm since I’m a stomach and side sleeper, adjustable base and all and upgraded from queen to king!!!!
NotSignal	i havent been sleeping well all week long (only 4-5 hrs) so having 7 yrs feels amazing!!! Hope all sleepless ppl here get a good sleep as well !
NotSignal	I have this issue lately... I get hot really easily. But I need a cover to fall asleep, & I hate thin blankets. I’m thinking my thick blanket is making it really hot. Can anyone recommend any brands that sell cool comforters or something?
Signal	So I’ve had trouble sleeping for a while now, I’m talking laying in bed (away from screens) for up to 3 hours before being able to sleep. I’ve had depression along with terrible trust and abandonment issues for around 2 years now because of abuse/loss. So I usually isolate and push people away nowMy insomnia is really bad for me because I spend all that time laying there thinking bad thoughts, not overly suicidal or anything, just really hoping that I won’t wake up, like hoping this is the last time I’ll have to sit here. And when I do sleep, I find it super hard to get out of bed unless there’s meaning (a task I have to do, e.g school/interviews) and because of Corona virus I’ve graduated early and don’t have school, so I don’t really have a purpose right now Was hoping there’s any tips from fellow insomniacs?
Signal	I started struggling to sleep about 4 months after my baby was born even when he was sleeping. Spent hours on the internet and this reddit trying to figure out how to treat it. I realized that no matter what stressor started the cycle I had definitely started to catastrophise not sleeping. I thought about it constantly and tried all sorts of sleep hygiene as well as several medications (prescribed by a dr). The sleep hygiene definitely made it worse for me because I knew I was doing it to sleep.Anyway about a month ago after a few really bad nights I started learning to relax and think about other things before falling asleep and luckily it worked and for a little over a month I have been able to fall asleep and get back to sleep no problem.Then for some reason last night I was having trouble feeling relaxed. Which turned into worrying about not sleeping, which turned into staying up until 3am. I woke up at 715 with my baby and he went back to bed and even though I’m incredibly tired I feel anxious to the point of sick that I’m getting back into a cycle of zero sleep.So, my question is how do I stop these racing thoughts and allow my body to relax and realize one bad night is not the end of the world? Any tips are appreciated
Signal	With zero sleep what so ever for the past 48 hours, I am starting to loose it a bit. Things are floating, shadows, cannot think straight etc. Do you guys have any emergency tips, procedures, mix of otc meds that you can take when it gets this bad? Really don't want to go to ER and get sectioned or something. Thanks in advance.
Signal	I’ve had sleep problems ever since I can remember. I was 5 years old up all night because I struggled to fall asleep. Never took naps or anything. I am now 22 and still have not figured out how to fix it. I was prescribed trazodone before but that didn’t do anything. & melatonin has never helped. I also wonder why I even have insomnia in the first place.
Signal	I haven't been able to sleep well for the past few days because of my grandma's passing. It was very sudden and I've been doing my best to cope by staying with friends (I live alone). I've noticed that when I'm stressed my stomach cramps, I get nauseous, and I can't sleep. I had a few occasions where I would fall asleep at the wheel on my way to work (so I call out now when this happens). I'm just not sure what to do right now. Because of the situation it may take longer to pass.
Signal	I love that this group exists because I feel like other people that have “sleeping problems” just don’t get it. I have been struggling with insomnia which is linked to my anxiety and depression and lately I have been waking up at exactly 2:45am and can’t go back to sleep until 4 after having 2 drinks.I hate this alcoholic side of me. While I realize it could be worse, I’m so ashamed of my bad habits right now but so hungry for just a couple hours of sleep. Although yes, I know alcohol lowers your sleep quality.Just venting and seeing if anyone else is struggling with similar stuff. Not happy that y’all are in this group, but somewhat comforted that I’m not the only one. Restful nights to all tonight
NotSignal	for months now my doctors and I have been trying to figure out the reason I haven't been able to sleep properly. one of my doctors put me on topamax for migraines (as he thinks it's related to the lack of sleep) but it hasn't helped with either migranes or sleep. my insurance just approved an EEG (electroencephalogram) and I'm really nervous about the whole thing, is there anything I should know in advance?
NotSignal	It has been 8 days and i have the same time that i waking up at 7a.m and thank god i can go back to sleep and it takes me about an hour to fall in sleep in the begining 😔 affraid that this will last forever
NotSignal	Others: Pray for money and carsMe: A good 8 of sleep for the rest of my life
Signal	Hey everyone, like you I seem to have some sort of Insomnia. Over the past 3ish years? My doctor prescribed me hydroxyzine 25mg. And most of the time it worked. Now last Thursday into Friday I was waken up at 3am and had work 7am (my alarm is set for 5:30am for content) and I was just up, couldn’t fall back asleep even though I was tired. On Friday, someone suggested I add magnesium to my sleep schedule. Along with the 10mg of melatonin I take. It was even worse trying to fall asleep. Last night was the first time NOT taking the magnesium supplements and I fell asleep faster, but was still up at 3am and couldn’t get back asleep. Is my body finally getting used/dependent on this? From my research hydroxyzine is non habit forming. Idk what to do. Any advice ? Similar issues?
Signal	Prescription sleeping pills (not those OTC pills) are actually super safe. I am not sure why there are so many misunderstandings of them. If you don't believe, just check the LD50.For many people, sleep pills can make you live better, not worse. Insomnia is the major issue that lowers your quality of life. Insomnia can hurt your health condition as well. Sleep pills provides a quick way to get rid of those.Many professionals take medicine for sleep as well. For example, pilots, doctors, and firefighters, they use Ambien for longer term. Better sleep than not. For many people, pill is a good solution.And don't overestimate you can get addiction to it. I take Ambien as well, usually when I need to work night and sleep in the morning. I feel there is no addiction or tolerance at all. I just stop taking Ambien when I don't need shift work. Many patients have been on sleep pills (many of them on benzo) for years, and medicine still works. There is no hard evidence that tolerance can't be avoided. It depends, and actually I see tolerance occur only at small portion of patients.
Signal	Hi guys,Absurd title I know, but it's true. A few months ago I had to quit my job (I was a waiter) as I had a severe foot injury that stopped me walking. Hence, I've been working from home doing something else. I find myself sleeping for a full 8 hours, not a problem there, wake up at 8. But by the time bedtime comes around I'm just not tired, my mind is so busy that I cannot sleep. I try to sleep for an hour, then I get bored and just get back up and carry on working. I'll then usually start to get extremely tired around 3pm the next day and then force myself to stay awake until that evening, then have a lovely peaceful sleep again. It seems like I'm not getting tired quickly enough in the evenings. It also takes me 4-6 hours to fall asleep on those nights where I get bored, without fail. I've found more and more I've become tolerant of sleep deprivation and found it numbs me which is kind of a relief from my depression as I can't think as well when sleep deprived, idk... Any thoughts?Cheers.
Signal	I'm been trying to not think about my Insomnia at night. But when you're laying in bed and you're conscious the entire night and then the sun rises, how do you just say "cool". I go to bed at 10pm and before the Insomnia used to automatically wake up at 5am. I tried melatonin and that didn't work. The "leave after 20 minutes and do something boring," doesn't work. The second I hit the bed, I'm wide awake for the entire night. Then at 3am my adrenaline kicks in giving me this weird sensation where I have so much energy. I either fall asleep at 6am and wake up at 10 or I fight daytime sleepiness for the entire day only to involuntarily pass out in the afternoon for an hour. Either way I don't fall asleep at night. I don't take naps during the day because I want to build up sleep pressure. But then as soon as I close my eyes, all the sleep pressure I built up disappears. I had a bout of Insomnia from May 5th to June 23rd. I think it was because I wasn't working. Something about not having a routine. Prior to this, I never had sleep problems. Even during the most stressful periods, I would always fall asleep. I started exercising more. Some days I would walk nine miles just to exhaust myself and would still not be able to fall asleep. When I finally decided to see a sleep doctor for CBTI I had to wait two weeks after the evaluation and then I finally saw him the bastard goes on vacation and to this day hasn't called me back. But when I got called back to work the insomnia went away. I left this subreddit and I didn't need to call him back. I could finally sleep again and everything was better. The bitterness, self loathing and suicidal thoughts I had experienced that month was gone. I became a more grateful person and In between that time I found a better job. Everything was looking better. But last Saturday something stressful that day kept me awake. Just like that my Insomnia came back and my circadian rhythm is screwed up again. AFTER ONE BAD NIGHT. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? And now I can't just say, "At least I don't have to work." I'm on my fourth day of Insomnia and just like before I go to bed at 10pm and I don't fall asleep until 6 and wake up at 10.I am just so sick of my stupid brain forcing all nighters on me. I don't know I'm going to cope when school starts in September. .
NotSignal	Ever since, my ex broke up with me and our wedding was cancelled, I have been having a hard time getting sleep. Atleast before the lockdown, I had a job, I could go to gym or go for a run. Now that I'm home all the time, its getting even more difficult. I don't sleep at all. I miss my ex so much more now. I don't sleep at all or Maybe once in 2 days, passing out and oversleeping. My sleep app adjusted itself so now it reminds me to sleep at day time. I have never felt so alone or lonely. I work out at home, try to tire myself out. I once walked back and forth my apartment till 6am in the morning. I started around 12, hoping to tire myself out and sleep. But I couldn't sleep. So I just log in to Netflix and just kept walking back and forth because it was the only way to clear my head from thinking about my ex. Is there any way I can get some sleep?
NotSignal	I saw a comment on here the other night but now I can't find it. It was explaining a technique that could help sleep come easier. Essentially, it was go to bed at 12 am and wake up at 6 am no matter what. If you didn't sleep at all or slept the whole time, just get up. I wanted to reread that comment for more info but since it's seemed to disappear, I was wondering if any of you guys could give advice. thank you!
NotSignal	People are always so shocked if they know I haven't slept for at least 2 days and it always confuses me, insomnia has become such a normal part of my life and I always forget being sleepless for a few days is a really big problem. Does anyone else experience this?
NotSignal	So last night, under emotional, mental and psychological problems, I got so exhausted, I fell asleep around the 11:30 range range, there were moments of waking up but fell back to sleep being so tired. I finally woke up at 1 pm this afternoon. So now another problem: why do i have to have a full 8 hours of sleep then a surplus because of problems going on in my life?
NotSignal	Does anyone else hear every creak in the house when they're trying to get to sleep? I'm constantly terrified someone is breaking in and have to check the noise. I have anxiety but I really don't understand why this is such a thing for me because I've never been burgled in my life.I live with my boyfriend but he's a really deep sleeper so I worry he might not hear. I'm such a light sleeper so it really shouldn't bother me since I would absolutely hear someone breaking in anyway.I honestly think it's got to the point where I'm hallucinating a lot of the sounds.
Signal	I've had insomnia since I was a child. At this point I've gotten used to my weird and terrible "sleep" I get. People who are close to me know I have insomnia, however, they do not understand it at all. They sleep immediately as soon as their head hits the pillow. I know they are trying to "help" because they feel bad but it's slightly annoying. I never asked for help or advice. I get questions like..."Why can't you sleep?" "What are you thinking about?" ...etc... What's worse is when they send me random websites about foods or activities that can help or cure insomnia. I've told them to stop and thankfully SOME of them have.
NotSignal	How togo to work? And tips from you guys? This is common for me but im starting to not cope
Signal	Hi, it's 5am of course and I haven't slept yet. I have insomnia. Sometimes when I try to sleep I will sleep for a bit, then all of the sudden I will hear some annoying sound and I will wake up. It's always sounds I find really really annoying. It's like my brain tries to purposely make me hallucinate the most annoying sound to keep me up.I have a weird problem where continuous repeated sounds feel like torture to me.. I won't go into detail, but it's a result of lifelong trauma.Today I got baby chicks, and I love chicks and all. But they chirp... A lot. So as I keep trying to fall asleep, I keep hearing baby chicks chirping.Idk why I'm posting but I'm just annoyed.On another note, I also tend to sleep walk and my boyfriend said I have been doing it lately and I'm freaked out. He said I got out of bed once and walked over to his side to kneel down on the floor while resting my arms on the bed and stared at him. then made a sound as if I was frustrated and then buried my face into the palms of my hands. Then I go back to laying back down. .... Wtf
Signal	Before May 5th 2020 I rarely if ever had insomnia and if I did the next day it would be business as usual. At the time I was working a seasonal job at whole foods two weeks prior. After the second night of insomnia, I had heart palpitations when I laid in bed. Just trying to sleep in my bed is like I had a gallon of coffee. My mind goes from exhausted to wide awake instantly. sleeping on my air mattress ended up hurting my back. I have sleep onset and I've only been able to get 3-4 hours of sleep at 5am. For the entire week. day and night I have heart palpitations. Working at whole foods with insomnia was a challenge in itself. I was an online shopper and I could not focus on anything. So on the 9th day of, I quit my job and even offered a two weeks notice but was told that wouldn’t be necessary. Then on the 10th day, it just went away. So for a week I’m back to my normal self and happy that’s it finally over.And guess what, it came back out of nowhere. So here I am at 1am writing this and I have never been more miserable in my life. At this point I have researched every single tip to stop insomnia and tried every single one. I created a relaxing sleep schedule, I’ve been exposing myself to sunlight and exercising, eating healthier, taking melatonin, sprayed lavender, drank a combination of chamomile tea and warm milk. The only thing I haven’t done is medication. I feel like my Circadian Rhythm is permanently broken. Yesterday I walked 2 and a half hours and still had insomnia. Even worse than the insomnia is my bible thumping mother. Ever since I stopped believing in the Christian God in 2017, my mom has been making me feel like sh\*t always telling that my life will be in turmoil unless I believe in God. Every piece of advice she gives me is related to the bible. She gets angry at me for not being positive about Insomnia. When I was on Zoloft for OCD and anxiety she kept harassing me about getting off of it, always reminding me that I’m like a Zombie and lethargic. Eventually this year I stopped just to shut her up. And she’s the head nurse at Penn Medicine. And my only friend is a bible thumper too. When I told him about my insomnia, his first response was to blame the devil. And just like my mom, the only advice he’s given me was related to the bible. And speaking of my mom she is so relentless about pushing the bible in my face. She thinks reading scripture and listening to pastors will help me during this time. She even told me that having this insomnia might be God’s way of me seeking him. And my thought is why would a loving God try to destroy my mind and body just to prove a point. But she’s the type of Christian that believes birds sing because they are praising God.Right now I feel hopeless. I’m destroying my mind and there is nothing I can do about it. On the 9th day an hour after I quit Whole Foods, I sat in my tub filled with water and put the toaster in. But it was a newer toaster so it didn’t work. But these kinds of thoughts give me relief because every day my desire to keep fighting dwindles. There are many people that have dealt with insomnia for years. Right now I’m scared because it happened recently and this is the first time it’s lasted this long. I don’t know when or if it will go away because this is new to me. My biggest issue is that this insomnia has spiraled out of control. No amount of positive talk has stopped my mind from being wired at night. No amount of advice I have followed on reddit has stopped my heart palpitations. I forgot to mention that last week I spent $400 on Sleepio, an online CBT.I app and so far it’s having my fill out a sleep diary. No actual lessons yet.I'm sorry this post is so long.
NotSignal	Im curious if any one of you have experienced hallucinations due to sleep deprivation. Can you please tell me more about it. How would you compare it with the ones that you experience on psychedelics?
NotSignal	Yet another night of no sleep whatsoever. I had a good streak of about three or four months where I was sleeping normally, but now I’m back to square one. I get stuck in hypnagogia; I feel my body in that weird transition state from awake to sleeping, but I can’t fully cross over. My stupid, anxious brain has once again convinced me that I have SFI even though I know deep down that’s not the case. I’m so sick of this shit. Why does this always come back? Why me? I’ve tried over the counter sleep aids, kratom, magnesium, hypnotherapy/meditation, regular therapy, and so on. My doctor is no help but she won’t just give me a damn pill. I swear I wish I just had a bottle of chloroform so I could just knock myself out.
Signal	I’ve been struggling with chronic insomnia for 6 years now. It’s ruining my life. I’ll have good times where I can fall asleep ok for like a week straight (with help from pills of course) and then I have weeks like this one where nothing I do is working. I’m going insane. I can’t live like this. Last night I couldn’t fall asleep again, even though I had only slept 2 hours the night before, and was crying to my husband saying how I just wanted to die. I’m so scared I’ll get to a point where I actually do consider taking my life. I feel like it’s not taken seriously enough. People think since it’s not immediately life threatening that it’s fine. Especially since I live in the US, and people here love to brag about how little sleep they got and how many cups of coffee they’ve had. I’m so over it. It’s so fucking hard to deal with.
Signal	20 mg tonight and its only been 30 mins and now I'm ready to pass out. Hopefully I can stay asleep the whole night.
NotSignal	Since I barely get ANY sleep the bags under my eyes are pretty visible. My friends make jokes about it and at first it was funny but it’s hard to look at my face without seeing such dark spots under my eyes. I asked what if I covered up my bags and all of them said something in the lines of “it wouldn’t be you”. It’s nice to know that my personality consists of my issue to sleep. At least raccoons are cute.
Signal	I fall asleep fine, but I wake up several times per night every night (2-3 is normal, 5-7 happens often enough). Sometimes I can fall asleep easily again, sometimes not. I usually remember some tidbit of a dream when I’m waking up. The only relief seems to come when I drink just the right amount before bed — 1-2 drinks, finish them at least 1.5 hours before bed. I know what they say about alcohol harming sleep, so it seems odd this would work better for me than melatonin or a sleep aid.I do have an anxiety disorder and depression. Is that what’s going on? Sleep apnea? I’m in my 30s and female, about 5lbs overweight.What is this? What can I do to just sleep again?
NotSignal	My baby is 4 months old now and wakes once a night. I however wake up usually two hours before her and toss and turn until she wakes up. Any little thing that disrupts my sleep completely wakes me up and I cant fall back to sleep because I'm on high alert for the baby waking up. I also have this mental thing where I have to pee before falling asleep, so that could mean several trips to the bathroom while I'm desperately trying to fall back asleep. I don't even have to pee but my brain makes me feel like I have to go anyway. Anyone going through anything similar and have any tips for conquering this?
Signal	I am now 2 weeks using zoloft and whenever i try to sleep without benzo's i don't sleep at all due to racing thoughts. I am afraid to delevop a benzo addiction so i am really in despair at this point. What would you guys do?
NotSignal	Tomorrow I can finally talk to an endocrinologist to sort out my thyroid issue. I am hoping to get proper meds as soon as possible so i can be able to sleep properly and wake up well rested. This whole insomnia thing has just been an utter nightmare for me and my family both and I'm hoping that whatever iodine medication I'm given does the trick. This will be a new chapter of my life and I'll probably leave this subreddit once the sleeping problems have fully receeded, but I am thankful to all who gave me the advice I needed to keep myself going. Right now my visual snow and tinnitus is still utter garbage but I'm pretty sure It'll be better as soon as I get my shit back on track. Again, thank you guys, see you on the flip side.
NotSignal	I have hyperthyroidism which has given me my horrendous insomnia. My body has aged from it and I need to fix it fast. How do I recover?
Signal	First time posting here. For the past week or so I have not been able to hardly sleep. I have developed anxiety which I think has caused me to be depressed as well. This may be due to quitting nicotine and weed. I was/am addicted to both and would use both everyday. My last real cigarette was 1/30 but have taken a couple puffs off a vape since then. I have quit both basically cold turkey. My last thc was 2/6. I took a dab and got super anxious and had to leave my house due to not feeling safe. ( somewhat suicidal thoughts)Weed used to be my go to for sleep. Now, I get super anxious and even paranoid. As far as sleep, I just cant fall asleep. My mind will not turn off. I lay here every night telling myself I need to sleep but cant. I can rest (not actually sleep) for maybe 20 minutes at a time then wake up and turn over constantly throughout the night. Last night I went and bought a few supplements to hopefully help me but no luck. I took a “sleep aid formula” which contains:25 mg Magnesium100mg L-theanine75mg Valerian extract 75mg Chamomile extract 50mg Gaba 50mg Passionflower extract 50mg Lemon balm 50mg Hops extract 10mg melatonin Had no effect on putting me to sleep. Still tossing and turning all night long not sleeping. I’m not sure what to do at this point. I do have a doctors appointment in a few days so hoping that may help. Just wanted to write this to talk to others and maybe get some advice.
NotSignal	I have recently started working again after a 4 month hiatus and so my sleep schedule has had to shift to waking up much earlier. I have always had issues with sleep and for years I can seem to get by on around 6-7 hours sleep without any problem. However the last week I have developed really horrible insomnia. At first it was not being able to switch off which resulted in two completely sleepless nights. However I begun to practice meditation and listening to calming music and I was able to fall asleep without too much trouble. Now the problem has shifted to I will wake up at maybe 2/3 AM and when I try to go back asleep I can feel myself relaxing and my breathing slowing down but my brain will just wake right back up. This will happen on a continuous loop until my alarm goes off. I have no idea why it's happening. It's not like brain zaps or anything sudden it will literally just feel like a gentle surge of awareness and then I have to start all over again. Has anyone experienced anything similar or have any advice for ways to remedy it?
Signal	my eyes get tired, everything gets tired, but I still feel my brain not shutting down, but I dream a lot, even though I sleep very little
Signal	EVERYONE CAN FUCKING SLEEP EXCEPT ME WTF!!! SOMEONE HELP ME NOW!!! I WILL COMMIT SUICIDE SOON AND I HOPE I GET PERMANENT SLEEP I DONT WANT TO EVER WAKE UP!!!
Signal	Almost daily there are posts along the lines of:1. I tell all my friends and family about my insomnia but they don't realise how bad it is. I'll say something like "i got NO sleep last night". and they'll be like "oh wow so you only got like 6 hours". "No, i got NO sleep, literally none. Like 2 hours."2. i hate it when i tell all my friends and family who i already know don't have insomnia about my insomnia, and they reccomend *insert basic sleeping tips non insomniacs would use*. AS IF I HAVEN'T TRIED *BASIC SLEEPING TIPS* BEFORE. Jeez I'm so angry. I'm so angry that i'm going to bring my insomnia up with other friends and family so i can myself riled up again.3. doesn't it make you so angry how others can fall asleep in like 10 minutes4. hate fakers that struggle to fall a sleep once in a while that think they have insomnia
Signal	Hello everyone! I have a very strange and frustrating sleep pattern that i would like to share with you and maybe get some advice on how to **escape this cycle**.As the title says, the first 2 weeks of this cycle is just a normal and healthy sleep rhythm, its from **2 AM** to **12 PM** (not average i know, but that fits best with me). After that, the next week will be shifting a bit from falling asleep between **2 AM** and **4 AM** and waking up between **12 PM** and **2/3 PM**. The week after that, the 4th week it gets really frustrating, because i cant fall asleep before **4 AM** and shifts to **6/7/8 AM**, which concludes in me having a lot of stress about again not being able to sleep and eventually deciding to skip a night so i could finally have some sleep for at least 2 weeks again -\_-...I'm writing this right now at **7 AM** my time and this was that night for me that i decided to skip again.I'm open to all suggestions and don't mind a conversation because i now have that "short on sleep high" happy feeling. Also please be easy on me and my grammar, i suffer form dyslexia and cant really think straight for obvious reasons :D
NotSignal	I know so many people that love falling asleep to the sound of rain, but I don't find it relaxing at all. To me it's erratic and loud, and can actually keep me awake even longer.
Signal	This has been going on for years. Should I pull an all-nighter and try to sleep at a decent time the following day? Should I just take a quick nap for sleep and then force myself up so that Im tired enough to fall asleep during a decent time? Ive tried laying down and forcing myself to sleep but end up I just laying there for hours which creates anxiety and all I can think of is whatever is stressing me out. Any advice?
Signal	Hello there! Like many of you - I've struggled with insomnia for years. As some of you have mentioned in your posts, a night without the help of a prescription sleep aid looks like this: I turn off all electronics by 10, brush my teeth/wash my face, stretch, journal my thoughts/anxieties, and then read until I feel sleepy. Once I feel sleepy, I crawl under the covers and try to go to sleep by focusing on my breathing (4-7-8 method, etc), even using guided meditation and then sleep never comes - no matter how tired I am. No matter how exhausted I am. I exercise regularly, more than one hour every day and that doesn't even help. It's not so much my life worries that keep me up - my brain just thinks of dumb shit and won't stop. I've tried listening to podcasts, boring audiobooks, ASMR youtube videos, classical piano, ambient noise and nothing helps. Melatonin doesn't work, nor does smoking weed (Indica) or masturbating. Even when I get up and read and then try and go back to sleep my mind still trails on and on. Suddenly, it's 3 am and I'm stressed about not being able to function at my high-performing and demanding job. It really frustrates me because I didn't grow up with sleeping problems. They just started during the transition to grad school and stayed with me through my job. I want to get back to a place where I can get tired, lay down and fall asleep. Beyond the approaches I have already laid out that I have tried - there are specific responses I'm looking for (that I hope helps everyone else!): 1) What is your full wind-down routine?2) What have I not tried that you would recommend to calm my mind down and stop stressing about sleep? 3) Do you have a sleep mantra that you find particularly soothing and useful? If so - what is it and how many times do you repeat it when you lie down? Thank you in advance for any suggestions and for reading my post! I hope this helps many more people than just myself - so give it all you've got :)
NotSignal	I'm not sure if this goes here, but for the past 1.5 months I've been waking up for a few seconds which causes me to be aware that I'm awake before going back to sleep. When I wake up I often go to the bathroom and my brain feela oddly alert during that time. Is this considered insomnia? It really making me extremely tired during the day and I don't know what to do about it.
NotSignal	Sometimes I imagine having to get up in 2 minutes. I feel blessed that I don't have to do so and it gives me a little bit of relaxation and comfort. 
NotSignal	Can you become an insomniac over night? Last Wednesday I could not sleep thinking of things I had to do for work that week. The next two days I only got about 3 hours of crappy sleep, followed by another all nighter. I’m currently sitting on my second day of no sleep and it’s frustrating. Yesterday I had a video visit with an adult medicine doctor and she recommended me to start drink magnesium at night alongside the melatonin I started drinking on Sunday. While I do know not sleeping is not ideal I was worried of not sleeping for many days and asked her what to do if I wasn’t able to fall asleep again (silly thoughts maybe) and she said not to worry that nothing was going to happen - just to avoid driving etc. I have seen people here go for days without sleep so that gives me a bit of (weird) hope that at least I’ll be ok. Sometimes I “think” I sleep but I feel like I just lay there. Like I’m in a weird state of very light sleep in and out. At one point during the night I opened my eyes and remember dreaming something, but I did not feel like I was in a deep sleep. I’m tired all day and yawning which I don’t understand why staying up all night happens. I don’t feel like I’m going to fall asleep anywhere though, just sensitive to light mostly, no headaches. Sending some positive vibes and hope for those going through the same for years, and those who are here due to the quarantine.
NotSignal	I was trying to sleep since 4:30AM last night and finally did at 6AM (after mosquito troubles, lol).. only to be woken up again by my parents at 9AM. Me being all sleepy, dozed off again only to wake up at 2PM.So, yeah, I pretty much got scolded. Hard. P.s. - I also slept yesterday in the day from 1PM to 4PM. I don't know where I'm going wrong. I try to wake up early every day which I was pretty good at for the previous 3 days. (Had been waking up at 8AM without any alarm). But due to this lockdown thing and exam getting postponed and having nothing to do, I tend to doze off. Help. Suggestions please!
Signal	It’s a well known fact I have intense insomnia. I panic when I’m about to fall asleep — and when I finally sleep (around 4am) three to four times a night I wake up screaming and thinking I’m about to die. Sometimes I wake up running in the hallway, not knowing how I got there.My sister can’t get a hold of me until around 3pm— when I visit my parents I can’t wake up in the morning.I’ve had this problem since I was a teen and now I’m almost 30 and still have awful problems— it’s actually gotten better thanks to meds but it’s still impossible for me to not go to be able to sleep until the early morning— and sometimes I don’t even sleep at all. The panic is still there no matter what I do.My mom refuses to let me tell my sister I have sleep problems. I don’t want to tell her all the gruesome details, all I want to tell her is I don’t sleep like ‘normal’ people do. She is almost 10 and she tells everyone that her sister is lazy— it’s kind of disheartening since I’ve been really present in her life despite living in another state— I visit a lot and play video games with her long distance. I try really hard to push through all this. I just wake up late!It just sucks. I don’t want to be like this at all. I’m exhausted all the time— but I’m trying!
NotSignal	Literally I should go to bed and feel tired but I don’t wtf
Signal	I tried so damn hard to sleep, I only got at most an hour of sleep, I thought I cured my insomnia, apparently I didnt, it was mixed in with my sleep paralysis and I'm fricken exhasted, do you know any good medications, or anything I can try at all, I have a test soon.
NotSignal	Does it still count as hours of sleep if you wake up during the night? Example last night I slept at 11:30pm woke up at 1:14 then tossed and turned for like 5 or 10 mins then woke up at 4:20 then slept and woke up at 5:40 and slept and final awakening 7:20
Signal	I've had insomnia since I was 13. I'm 24 now. Not every night but most nights, leading to me sleeping between 5 and 10-3pm. I can only sleep when I'm exhausted beyond belief and pass out. In order to get a sleep routine going, I usually have to do an all nighter til the next night. Once I have that, I have enough sleep debt to keep a routine going for a week or two, three if I'm lucky, but after that initial sleep debt is caught up, I'm back to being just a normal amount of tired at bed time and that is no where near enough to battle my insomnia and anxiety/ somniphobia. My question is, how do I keep that routine going?To add, I have fibromyalgia, which means extreme fatigue and allodynia (sensitive to pain) and pain after exercise. Add that to quarantine and that means I can't really "tire myself out" in the gentle way I used to (volunteering in an active job once a week and picking my partner up from work). Is there any other way? I've tried mindfulness but it doesn't really affect my insomnia and I've been on trazodone which did help but after a week of use it would give me severe ptsd nightmares which meant I'd have to stop it and the insomnia would kick in again (plus I don't think I can use it with my current medication). It's been so long i don't know if my body even knows how to sleep properly anymore without passing out at night. Any tips on things I'm missing or not thought of? Tia
Signal	I want to start CBTI but i’m not sure if it would be helpful in my case? What triggered my insomnia is that i suddenly started to worry about my sleep like how much time I would get and i’m worried about all the damages that sleep deprivation causes to your body. Most of the time I fall asleep easily but I wake up an hour later and after that I struggle to go back to sleep. Other than that i’m not really anxious about anything else. Would CBTI be effective on me or should I look more into CBT instead? Thanks
NotSignal	I'm so focused on my heart right now and I can't seem to sleep because of it. It seems to beat super slow and I can't stop checking my pulse. I have a 9 am exam tomorrow and am stressed about not getting enough sleep for it. I just feel tortured right now and want to cry.
Signal	Hi guys. I usually lurk more than post on reddit, but this has me kind of worried and I guess I want to know if this is normal.Basically, I used to be able to sleep for most days out of the week, but I’d always have 1 or 2 off days where I couldn’t sleep at night until around 3-4am. I could handle that. Last year, there was one night I remember where I couldn’t sleep at all and literally pulled an all nighter because I couldn’t sleep no matter how hard I tried. Granted, the next day was a fun vacation and I was probably just very excited. I kind of shrugged that one off. I moved to a state where marijuana is legal and recreational, so I started smoking it every day and I didn’t have trouble falling asleep at all after that. I’ve noticed some negative side effects of smoking every day like brain fog and memory problems so I decided to quit. This was a few days ago. The concerning part is that a few days ago when I quit, I started having sleepless night again. I have major health anxiety and OCD so I’ve been worrying a lot on and off for the last 6+ months about developing some crazy mental illness. I want to believe it’s linked to anxiety, or even quitting MJ. However, I couldn’t sleep 3-4 days ago, and I couldn’t stop playing songs in my head no matter how hard I tried. I literally couldn’t “shut off” my thoughts. I smoked weed one time this weekend on Saturday and slept great! Then, this happened again just tonight where I couldn’t sleep and the music in my head wouldn’t go away. I have a job interview today and sadly am going to have to go with no sleep. I’m still very new to this so I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone else has experienced something similar and what you do in general to fall asleep?Edit: Also would like to add that it’s been very common for years for me to wake up in the middle of the night multiple times — weed let me sleep all night though which is the main reason why I started using.
Signal	I delay trying to go to sleep as much as possible because I’m scared I’ll just lay in bed the whole night beating myself up for not being able to fall asleep. I’m weirdly conscious about my heart rate increasing when I’m trying to sleep, which keeps me up even if I’ve taken a zopiclone or lorazepam. It’s weird to say but I don’t even know how to fall asleep anymore. I’ve been to my doctor a few times about it and she’s prescribed me different pills on each occasion. I’m just really feeling frustrated with myself and why I can’t seem to ever fall asleep when everyone else in my family knocks out as soon as their head hits the pillow. I think this post is just a stream of consciousness but does anyone have any advice or maybe something that’s helped you calm down before falling asleep?
NotSignal	Does anyone have a sleep med that they inject into themselves?I have issues digesting medication and am starting down the path with my doctor of injections.Any advice would be great
NotSignal	All I can think about every minute of the day and night is how bad of a person I am. I don't have dreams or nightmares when I do sleep maybe an hour or two each night, and then one day a month I'll knock out for 14 hours without dreaming or nightmaring. Only to wake up in my disgusting waste of space called a body (which is absolutely pathetic and scrawney). That 14 hours of sleep I do get at varying times of day once a month feels like I blinked. Sometimes if I don't sleep for a couple days I get suicidal thoughts too.
Signal	I have been with insomnia for seven years. I went to the doctor earlier this year (first time for insomnia) and he has sent me melatonin 3 mg each pill with herbs (linden, valerian and passiflora). I took two pills every night but it didn't work.In my country we are little more than a month in quarantine and that has worsened my nights. I really don't know what to do anymore.
Signal	I feel sleepy everyday at around 4pm because of my poor night's sleep. I usually sleep for around **1- 1.5 hrs in the noon** which helps me feel energised in the gym later on at 6 pm.. However I have noticed that it is affecting my night's sleep.. I feel alert at 11 pm which sucks. What can I do to have a proper night sleep? - stop sleeping in the noon, Reduce technology exposure, reduce jerking off (almost once daily), increase sun exposure ( I was diagnosed with **vitamin-D at 8 ng/ml** a year ago), reduce intensity in the gym or maybe eat more??I usually feel sleepy at 1 AM but see today also I woke up at around 5 AM. These 4 hour sleep cycles affecting my ability to enjoy the next day. What's going to help? Please please suggest few tips.. Waking up in the morning and feeling like a old man sucks.. Because of this I also got tested for **Testosterone** without any prescription. It came in the higher range at **1001 ng/dl.**
NotSignal	I have seen multiple councillors who have all told me to just exercise and I'll be able to sleep but that doesn't stop the anxiety and i can exercise for long because of my asthma so it does nothing. I have tried a routine, breathing exercises, staying up all night to "reset" which made it worse and she said that medication doesn't help at all so she won't even try it. I don't sleep at night and i can only sleep for an hour in the late afternoon when i pass out but i can't even do that anymore because of the new compulsory live lessons from school. I can't live like this anymore i even tried not eating because then i would have literally no fuel in my body but it didn't work i just felt sick. I am starting to see things and I'm terrified. I can't go to a doctor because my practice doesn't do phone appointments and going to the building would expose me to covid. Please help me I'm falling apart.
Signal	hi. hello. what’s up.i’ve been barely sleeping recently. i fall asleep at 11, wake up at 12, stay awake until 2, fall asleep until 7, or just fall asleep at 12:30 and wake up at 6. either way i have a fitbit that tracks my sleep and it says my average is around 3-5 hours of sleep. at my age i’m supposed to be getting 9/10 hours. i’m getting less than half every day.My biggest problem is racing thoughts. i can’t sleep because my brain won’t shut up. if i do fall asleep, i’ll wake up a few hours later and my head with still be going on about something dumb. i can’t stop thinking. melatonin isn’t helping, and no matter how tired i am it’s like i just can’t sleep. i have anxiety and the thought of not sleeping at all makes it worse. if anyone has tips i’d really appreciate it!
Signal	My only real night off and nope... It hurts my eyes. Relentlessly impossible prison of insomnia. Gonna take .5 mg of klonopin maybe that'll work.
Signal	So it is now 5:30am and I have to sleep, and I always do end up falling asleep. But then it’s so hard to get up when I’m actually supposed to. Like today I need to be up early, like 10am to study for my chemistry final. I’m so anxious about my exam. Like I have to spend the whole day tomorrow to study. But lately I have been waking up at like 1pm because I haven’t been able to sleep properly! I just took my animal behavior final at 8:00pm yesterday and it was extremely difficult for a class that literally all we had given was online PowerPoints with no lecture material. So basically had to teach myself everything and just the questions were so tricky and difficult. I’m so nervous about my grades suffering because of this pandemic and it’s keeping me awake. Also this guy has been randomly adding me on Snapchat once in a while and then unadding me because he’s horny or whatever is keeping me up because I’m thinking about him for no good reason lol.
NotSignal	I love Cryaotic, but I'm running out of quieter stuff from him. Looking for people who play quieter games (bigger/old titles are best, that way I won't be too engrossed) and don't scream a lot. Any suggestions? I say game channels, but I'm open to anything that isn't ASMR (too creepy) or learning/exploring (too interesting). Thanks for the help!
Signal	I have had a vast array of terrible neurological issues ever since I was a kid. It started slow and has ramped up as I got older.For some backstory I've always been a healthy weight, exercised regularly, and eaten pretty decent. I do what I can to be healthy.The first symptom was the tinnitus, I've had it for as long as I can remember. It used to be one note, constant, and very high pitched. I went to multiple doctors, all of whom said I was fine and "some people just have tinnitus". When I was around 11-12 middle School age, another note was added in. It was more of a middle frequency hum. Much louder but only in dead quiet environments. Around the same time I started to experience sciatic nerve pain and, strangely enough for my age, nightmares. Even when I was awake I would feel an "evil presence" in my bedroom. To this day I still feel it once in a while, but it was worst in my childhood bedroom. Even just moving from one bedroom to the other helped immensely. But not completely.Not regular nightmares, but the recurring kind, where I knew I was dreaming, but the same demons would visit and torment me. It was different each time but it was always the same setting and characters. I was even sent to a psychiatrist who said that, even though it was strange at my age, "some people just have nightmares".Around high school age I developed a third pitch, even more high pitched, but it would randomly kick in throughout the day. Being very loud for a moment, drowning out everything for a minute until it passed. They explained this to me somehow, apparently "some people just get this random deafening ringing throughout the day". This is also when people started to have to repeat themselves a lot. But for a different reason. I was told that I was a bad listener. But I still managed to take hard classes and get good grades.Also in high school I developed migraines. Every September like clockwork I would get (and still get until recently - but we'll get to that) a neurological (as opposed to tension) migraine with the zigzag aura. I didn't know what it was at first but I couldn't see out of half my field of view for an hour at school and then as soon as my vision came back the pain came to match it. "There are preventative medications but some people just get migraines". Whatever, it's only once a year right?It started to accelerate around college time. Pretty much as soon as college started, I would have one night a month where I would not sleep at all. It didn't really bug me but it seemed strange. Again, more doctors, "some people just have insomnia once in a while".Since things seemed to be accelerating (but still too slowly at the time for me to tell), and within a year of the insomnia I was at about once every two weeks I'd be awake all night. It was slow enough I didn't really notice. But definitely progressing. Right at this time my least favorite symptom ever began. The muscle twitching. Rapid, hard thumpers in any given muscle randomly. Like the eyelid twitch everyone gets but in every muscle and much more intrusive (after all, a lat motor unit is way bigger than an eyelid one). Since then it's been every single day for four years as of three days ago. It got progressively worse but kinda plateaued after a while.For this I even got as far as mayo clinic. They basically had me drive all the way in just so they could sit me down and tell me "some people just twitch, it's benign, don't worry about it". I'm not worried about some horrible nerve degeneration, I just don't want to twitch anymore. It sucks.It seemed unrelated at the time, but a year after this started I crashed my car. I was driving up north to go mountain biking, well rested and having a relatively not twitchy day. It was fishing opener so I was in mild traffic on rural roads, but to this day I cannot remember everyone stopping. Suddenly everyone was stopped but me, and thankfully we were all moving very slow, but I did not stop with the rest of them. This will be important later.About a year ago it got bad. By last March I was at once a week I would not fall asleep, no matter how tired I was. Keep in mind that I had not been taking anything up to this point, benzos or otherwise. (Only allergy medications that I had always been taking. I've had three sinus surgeries after all). But I noticed a very scary pattern quickly. It was always Sunday-to-Mobday night that was my sleepless one. But one week it was Saturday night. The week after it was Friday, then Thursday, then Wednesday, then Monday, then Saturday, Monday again just days later, and then I was up for two nights in a row, slept one night, up for two nights, slept for one. You get the picture. Unrelated to the twitching, tinnitus, stress, etc. (At this point I was graduating in a month from college and was taking only the easy classes, the hard work was done).I was put on a high dose of ambien for the foreseeable future by a psychiatrist. He said that even though it was intended for short term, the risk of me not taking it was worse than the risk of me taking it. I was sick of driving home from work at night thinking that stopsigns were people because I was so tired.Ambien helped for a while but still failed to knock me out once every few weeks. Whatever, it's better than what has been going on. I'm pretty much tolerant to it now so I'm going to be looking for other options.This last September it was September 28 and I had not gotten my migraine. I thought maybe I was in the clear since it was two weeks late compared to every previous year. But while I was a groomsman at my best friend's wedding, I noticed VERY RAPIDLY that my vision was very bad, and my hearing was gone, and I felt terrible. This only lasted five seconds or so, but the bad part is that I woke up on the ground - tuxedo and all - six whole minutes later. I had a full grand mal seizure. Unprovoked, no drug withdrawal, well rested, and no alcohol ever (our religion forbids it).The neurologist took an EEG and MRI. Came back normal except for chiari malformation (which has to be the cause of all this - so many symptoms match), but my doctor said chiari is almost never symptomatic "so you're fine". And on top of this, "Some people just have seizures" even without epilepsy.But a month later I had the aura again. It didn't turn into a grand mal thankfully, but it was definitely a focal seizure. I will never forget that feeling, so when it happened again I was certain. And a month later it happened again. I was referred to an epileptologist, and this week I'm going to hear the results of a longer sleep deprived EEG.Since that first grand mal event I've had these episodes where I'll catch myself zoning and realize that I have no memory of the last few minutes or seconds. I have to bus everywhere I go. Sometimes I'll "zone in" earlier than usual, but it'll be like I'm stuck and unable to respond. "Just turn your head, just move your arm" I'll tell myself. But I can't. After a few seconds I'll move my fingertips and be able to move my way back to full motion. It isn't panic inducing or anything. But definitely noteworthy.I've realized since then that this has always happened. At least since my car crash. Even while I had been driving. I remember having moments in the car on the freeway where I literally think to myself "this would suck if I had to slow down quickly". But it was like my emotional state was altered during these seconds-long events. Like I figured I "could" snap myself out of it if I had to. I've only recently been realizing that I could not. And only because my epileptologist has pointed out that these themselves may even be small seizures (which can alter movement ability, emotional state ( involuntarily rationalizing it to myself), and memory). I have not been put on anything yet, since my doctor wants to either see something on EEG or have another grand mal before medication is justified. I'll happen. But not yet.And that's where we are now. It's 3:30AM and I don't even feel tired. Haven't slept in 22 hours, which isn't a huge deal. I've gone longer. Ambien didn't work last night so I guess that bandage has been removed prematurely. Insomnia triggers what I know to be (and what my epileptologist has suspected to be) focal seizures. I almost hope that it does generalize into another grand mal so that I can be put on medication. The emotional strain of knowing it's coming but now knowing when is starting to get to me. Walking down the street when I get a small aura, or even just a little lightheaded, turns into full on panic. Six minutes is a long time for a seizure and caused brain damage before, so it will again. And this time with an even bigger audience (all of downtown Minneapolis).I have a good job that I worked very hard for. Architecture school is just about the hardest, most greuling major there is. But all the band-aid sleep medications I've been put on are all too well tolerated now and "I cant sleep" isn't a valid reason to miss work. Even if it is for days on end.But tonight the twitching is too distracting, my ears are ringing too loudly even with my fan on hurricane mode. And on top of it my mind just ain't in the mood to sleep.There are so many things wrong that every day is torture. I'm constantly dizzy and tired and can't even go into a grocery store because the weird lighting triggers auras.I guess the "good" news is that a long time ago I somehow had anxiety added to my chart. I mean years ago - middle School era. Probably because I mentioned I have a fear of public speaking, just like everyone else. So doctors always have a copout. No matter what symptom it is, whether it be tinnitus, twitching, migraines, insomnia, seizures, or whatever else, "it's just anxiety".And despite all this, I look fine on the outside. So it doesn't matter anyway.
Signal	They work for me half the time and the other half they give me a racing heart. I am dealing with my first insomnia episode since last year and am trying to go the natural route: meditation, exercise, not laying in bed for more than 30 minutes, etc. It seems busy and hasn't helped yet really. Do I roll the dice and try medication again? I read somewhere where you should do your sleep medication for a week and then it should be more reliable. Is that the case? Thank you!
NotSignal	I am anxious and hypochondriac by nature, for the past few weeks I have no longer had a panic attack and I managed to bring down the anxiety increases with breathing exercises and daily meditation. For a few days of very bad nights (because of my cat ...) and I know that the lack of sleep promotes anxiety in me. For 3 nights I also wake up because my throat hurts, nothing serious and that night my hypochondriac nature took over! I started to focus on my sore throat and stress, I tried to get back down and I succeeded but it was fragile ... I fell asleep again around 4 am listening to a meditation app. I'm not sure what I'm asking here but this group really helps me and I needed to say my tired of these moments when I lose control ...
NotSignal	I just pulled an all nighter and if I fall asleep now, I'm not gonna get up and I'm gonna get yelled at....why does this happen??
NotSignal	Is it a sign?Ok so I want to preface with the fact that I just want to find some people who understand what I’m saying. I have always felt like I wouldn’t become old and most of my dreams are really scary ways of me either dying or being killed. When they aren’t those scenarios my dreams are wear in ways where I don’t have control over my body or the situation I am in. I just want to know if there is at least one person who can relate to what I’m talking about or if I am truly crazy. I hate sleeping because of the shit I see
Signal	Its currently 12:40am in Australia (where I live). Not even that late for my standards. In Aus, since the coronavirus is basically eradicated, I have school and have to be there by 8. I have to wake up at 4:30am and know full well that I won't make it through the day. I just can't sleep. My parents think that yelling at me will fix it but they don't understand that if I were to lay down and close my eyes, nothing would happen. I don't get tired until the sun comes up, which is inconvenient to say the least. I tried melatonin but i stayed up until the effect wore off. My parents typically take my laptop away for nighttime, but forgot to tonight. When I don't have it is the worst. I pile all of my blankets into a corner and just sit with my depressive thoughts. what can i do.Sorry if this makes literally no sense- I feel crazy rn
NotSignal	Hypnic jerk has ruined my sleep for a long time. Does anybody know how to deal with it or make it go away?
NotSignal	Hi guys I’m a teenager and I can get to sleep pretty easily I have a dark room cold room and no technology 1 hour before bed yet for some reason I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep at all. In the morning my breath is super dry even though I drink 2 litres + of water everydayAny advice please except melatonin
Signal	title.I just want to be able to sleep normally is that too much to ask for ;_; im so jealous of my friends istgand fuckkk i have an exam today omg kill me please
NotSignal	Been trying to kick insomnia for a while, but I need a doc to help me out with it. Does anyone know of any reputed CBT-I practitioners in India? No luck on google. Already went to a regular psychologist and psychiatrist to no avail. Thanks.
NotSignal	Like the title says I keep waking up after 1 hour of sleep and can't go back. I had really bad Insomnia some months ago, in which I just couldn't fall asleep for days on end. For some reason it got better and I slept normally again even 10 hours on some Days. Now I keep falling asleep at 1 am without any problems and wake up at the exact same time at 2 am for no reason at all. This is insanely frustrating. Of course my Mind won't let me go to sleep again and even if I happen to fall back to sleep I get really weird lucid dreams and sleep paralysis.
Signal	If I don’t sleep, I can still survive and have a mostly satisfying life. The only thing holding me back are negative bullshit thoughts about sleep and functioning.I felt tired last night and I’m trying to sleep restrict to condense my sleep. I was tired from the relatively sleepless night before, and was dozing off on my couch at 8:00 pm. My scheduled bed time is 11:30 pm. My wife and kiddo went to bed around that time. Instead of sitting on my couch, trying to fight sleep as I was reading, I drove to the nearest Starbucks, which was buzzing; I had to wait for a seat. I was able to sit in public and read, rather than sit in my living room in isolation, worrying about sleep and trying to fight the temptation for early bedtime. I was tired but I enjoyed myself and was even able to go to the store to pick up a few things I needed. Kinda cool that I used those extra hours of the day for enjoyment. I slept about 4 hours last night, with a nice solid stretch of deep sleep, and woke feeling pretty good. I slept a bit more the night before and didn’t get deep sleep and felt relatively shitty. My entire belief system about sleep is definitely shifting. For the first time in a decade, I’m starting to face (and diminish) my fears regarding sleep and insomnia.
Signal	it's been going on for a few years now but these past few months have been much worse than before like my sleeping schedule is such a mess i really can't sleep at night and id end up sleeping late in the day..... ive tried taking sleeping pills but it doesn't work what can i do?? i have to do school work during the day and to do that i should sleep at night
NotSignal	Am I going to sleep? No absolutely not but it helps to just not be upright for a bit and it makes me feel like I am relaxing. The longer I go without sleep the more I just want to l want to lie down I don't even try to sleep just kind of rest from a long day.
NotSignal	I have never been the type to have trouble sleeping but recently over the past week I’ve felt this weird pinch in my chest and it bothers me mainly at night. After a few days the pinching started to deteriorate but I could still not sleep. I am on the brink of knocking out when I suddenly feel suffocated and I need to move into a different position but even then it happens again with whatever position I’m in. I’ve also had problems with intense muscle spasms mostly in my legs where I am about to fall asleep and my legs kick intensely, it’s not your average twitch. I’ve also had my fingers feel like they ache at night and I have a need to crack them or massage them to make them feel better. Lastly, when I wake up I sometimes wake up in a state of confusion. I usually sleep at 12 am but recently I haven’t been able to sleep until 4 am. Any ideas or suggestions?
NotSignal	anyone else get like this? I have PMDD and PCOS so my periods are very infrequent but destructively intense when they happen. for all of January I've gotten 2-3 hours a night. way to start the new year, huh? I know this has to do with estrogen levels and progesterone or whatever but god, if being trans wasnt catalyst enough to want to yeet my entire reproductive system, then all this would be by itself. nothing helps, in case you're wondering. I've opened the windows and turned down the heat to accommodate the natural rise in temperature that happens while menstruating. I've limited caffeine to early mornings/none at all. I meditate, as usual. even if I take the stupid Tylenol PM knock-offs my Dr perscribes me, it'd do nothing as usual.if PMDD didn't make me wanna kill myself, then this insomnia would.
NotSignal	It seems like insomnia can be caused by a lot of things (including anxiety, etc). But I don’t feel anxious. But every night I do feel like I drank 4 shots of espresso at 10pm. My blood pressure also goes up at night too.Anyone else feel this way without feeling anxious, etc.? Wondering if this feeling is common for primary insomnia?
Signal	I’ve been taking zopiclone quite regularly for the past year but my doctor’s trying to prescribe alternatives as he’s afraid of dependency. I’ve tried amitriptyline and quetiapine but both have done nothing to help me sleep. Amitriptyline makes me feel like an absolute zombie while quetiapine didn’t have any effect whatsoever. Has anyone had luck with other sleep medications that can knock you out like zopiclone does? Xanax helps but it’s not available in my country anymore. TIA!
NotSignal	I know there aren't mosquitos in my room or mite or whatever in my bed. I'm clean, I scrubbed, I got fresh sheets. So WHY the FUCK does it feel like there's 20 bugs in my bed playing whack-a-mole with me?? Everytime I scratch or rub a spot, it gets worse somewhere else. It's infuriating, I'm already not sleepy but I'm fucking tired and I don't have the energy to get angry over this but it's so FRUSTRATING. I wanna crawl out of my skin and toss the meat and be a skeleton so I can just stop feeling the prickling sensations everywhere.
NotSignal	Dont read this subreddit when trying to fall asleep. Seriously.Now's not the time to solve this problem.
Signal	So I always have been a bad sleeper since a child. I have anxiety, and would spent some nights here and there totally awake, until I would fall asleep at 5/6 a.m. But it wasn't very frequent and I would sleep normal on the rest of the nights, although always waking at least one time per night.On 31st October 2019 I didn't a single minute. For the first time ever I actually didn't sleep a single minute. After that it has been downfall.I have insomnia every single night since that day. Every. Either I can't maintain my sleep, waking 4 to 5 times or I can't fall sleep at all. I've been to a neurologist and she gave medication to my anxiety. It didn't work. I started 4 days a new one, which puted my to sleep but failed to do so today.I did a CT scan and everything was right. My neurologist believes my anxiety is out of control and is the reason for my insomnia. She asked me to do a MRI to make sure everything is 100% right. I discovered the disease fatal insomnia and I'm so scared I have it. I know it very rare but still I can't sleep well a single night.As anyone been through this?
NotSignal	(you can skip this part) The easiest thing for me to imagine and dream about is sound. There are dreams I have that are completely black but with very vivid sounds, and every time I start to fall asleep I hear my dreams before I'm fully asleep, if that makes sense. And my dreams usually contain people yelling at me or at each other which feels like someone screaming into my brain, people saying the same thing over and over again which drive me nuts, or just saying things that really disturb me. I used to try and think about music and focus on that, but usually when I'm almost fully asleep i suddenly can hear the music really loudly and it wakes me up again. It usually takes me hours to fall asleep and my parents don't take my sleeping problem seriously even though I had it since I was 12, and it just got worse and worse.So my point is, I need something that isn't my imagination to focus on when I'm trying to sleep, but I'm very picky and a lot of videos I found on YouTube just made is harder and made my head hurt as well.I need something with a preety constant volume, no high pitch sounds and no background sounds or static sounds. I found a piano music that helped one, but the right hand parts were louder then the left hand, so it was kinda hard focusing on that. I also have problems with something that just repeat itself every few minutes.Do you guys know about something that can help me? (Hope it's the right sub for that kinda stuff, reddit still confuses me)
Signal	My insomnia has been getting worse since I was 10 and I have tried literally everything. Been tested for just about anything and everything that could cause chronic insomnia. Tried waking up early every single day. Tried every other sleep aid pill or tea or whatever under the sun. Some of them worked at first, but after a while, I develop a complete immunity to all sleep aids.I've gone about 120 hours (5 days) without sleep before, twice.Does anyone have any advice?
NotSignal	It’s a constant cycle of not getting sleep. When I do get sleep it’s during the day or only 2 hrs at night.
Signal	For the last 3-4 months I am trying to fix my sleep everyday but it keeps getting worse and my anxiety too.I don't sleep to fix my sleep and then I get cold and sick and fall asleep or if I can survive the next day I sleep but the other day my sleep fucks up again It never gets normalI don't sleep or I sleep for 18 hoursI can't do my daily stuff because I always think about this or I am usually sick and tired so I don't have the energyI am a student and I have to study for my exams but I can't I have to fix this thing any tips?
NotSignal	Friday night sleep 4:00 AM - 9:55 AM. (No bathroom breaks) but it was hard and took me approx 25 min to fall asleep. Tossing and turning. (1 nap in the afternoon for 1 hour)&#x200B;Saturday night sleep 12:55 AM - 7:00 AM (2 hour nap midday)&#x200B;Sunday night sleep 2:00 AM - 6:10 AM, 6:50 AM - 10:30 AM.&#x200B;Monday night sleep: 2:00 AM - 10:30 AM, (one bathroom break) (possible nap? day not concluded yet)This is based on the Australian Eastern Daylight Time
Signal	I have a problem staying asleep at night. My doctor says my testosterone is low so he prescribed a testosterone topical gel.Has anyone else here seen their insomnia improve after having low-testosterone and taking testosterone to fix the issue?Thanks!
Signal	I’m tired but I’m just staring at the ceiling and thinking, I barely sleep at this point because I’m to busy thinking about practically nothing and my average sleep on weekdays is about 10 hours all together. The lack of sleep is making me less motivated and the lack of motivation makes me wanna stay in my room and feel sorry for myself and sleep during the day. I wanna slam my head into dry wood
NotSignal	Posted last night, slept around 3 hours, decided to work out to worn my self out now I feel really dizzy and my head is pounding, should I tell someone or ask for help? Or is it ok if I just lay down for a while? I was gonna take a shower but I am afraid I'll pass out and get hurt
NotSignal	I would do fucking anything to get a wink of sleep at this point
Signal	I found myself writing paragraphs explaining my entire history with insomnia earlier, but as it continued to go on and on, I realized what I really wanted to do was just express my frustration that the ONLY cure to ever really work for my insomnia, antidepressants, specifically trazodone and Amitriptyline and to a lesser effect Zoloft, just turn me into an absolute zombie, utterly dependent on getting at least 9 hours of sleep to stay awake during the day. I remember when I tried trazodone for the first time, within days the daytime sleepiness had built to where after getting "only" 6 hours of sleep found myself being unable to stay awake during class, went out to my car and slept through the next class until my test later. When I realized I felt less emotion and affection for my fiancee at the time I stopped taking it. Amitriptyline was even worse, after sleeping 9 and a half hours and falling asleep during work I took an early lunch break and found myself being pulled over after fighting the urge to fall asleep on the drive back to work. It completely overwhelmed any effect my prescribed adderall might have had to where I once took one after waking up only to fall back to sleep for another 3 hours. I can stop taking the adderall, I can cut out all caffeine, but my sleep doesn't improve, I've taken ambien only for the highest prescribed dose to stop working after a couple days, I stopped drinking every night in an attempt to get the minimum few hours I needed to function and through numerous other ways managed to improve my sleep enough so I have hope now, but when it strikes, nothing else can truly stop it. When the insomnia gets bad enough for desperation to set in, it still sometimes find myself telling myself yet again that the exhaustion they make me feel can't possibly be as bad as the sleep deprivation I was facing and yet it always is. While I'm sure some people envy that I have any "cure" at all, or may have such severe insomnia that the way those medications effect me would still be preferably, for me, they're still not solution at all, and it is unbelievably frustrating sometimes.
Signal	Is this an efficient combo? My doctor said it was ok, but I’m worried about being woken up by vivid dreams. I take clonidine at night too. Been on trazodone for years, unfortunately. Lately I’ve been struggling to get past 6/6.5 hours of sleep no matter what.
Signal	Hey everyone, first time posting here. I've suffered from insomnia for many years now, probably as a result of depression and anxiety. The usual issue is that I can get to sleep just fine but I'll wake up 3-5 times throughout the night. Lately however, I've had trouble falling and staying asleep. I'm on meds for depression and anxiety but I do not feel as though I'm staying awake because I'm anxious or stressed about anything. I just don't know why.Anyways, for the last 2 weeks this has come to impact my work. I have found myself so exhausted in the morning that I am taking sneaky micro naps in my cubicle from 8 to about 10 and still not rested. I am living in a fog and driving is becoming dangerous. This makes me feel as though I should quit. I am fortunate enough that I can technically do so without any huge financial impacts (thanks savings and family). The only hitch is I need to be able to support my husband when we begin our lawyer immigration process.Sorry for the long post but I want to know others' perspectives and experiences with this. Should I quit? What have you done in this situations? TIA.
NotSignal	I enrolled in CBT-I and am having no results. I mean none - if anything things are actually worse. I am even on medication and that’s doing nothing. Is there anyone out there who this didn’t work for? I feel this was my last line of hope and I seriously want to cry and break down.
Signal	Hello all, Sorry for the long post but would really appreciate any insight on my situation.I've had occasional episodes of insomnia on and off for just over a year. It started off with me being stressed out about an exam, but then started happening more frequently after that (it happened once before that too but not to the same extent). I have tried CBD oil, gone through CBT therapy, and am currently taking 25 mg zoloft for over a month (probably upping to 50 mg today). What I find very interesting about zoloft is i am really thinking more clearly about this sleeping issue. Rather, it's an occasional heartrate issue which maybe makes me think too much about this problem (anxiety?)Basically, my resting heart rate normally is between 58-65 bpm. That's my "ideal" resting heart rate where I'm practically guaranteed to sleep well. However, some days it's at 73-80 when im ready to go to bed. During the bad insomnia times, the heartrate is probably ranging from 78-89 bpm, but i dont think it ever goes higher than that. I understand that the "normal" heartrate is been 60-100, but for some reason when my heart rate is high 70's or higher, that affects my sleep. There are several things that I have noticed speed up my heart rate. First, eating sugar and salty foods close to bed. This increases my heart rate by at least 15 bpm. Likewise, eating large meals after 8 or 9 usually causes my heart rate to increase. I don't think it's unusual that heart rate goes up after large meals, but why so much? Second, is stressful things like Tinder. This makes me excited, presumably raising my heartbeat. It's weird but when i was younger i used to fall asleep thinking about sex, but now if i think about sex that late my heart rate goes up. I have no idea why this is different now. Third, doing running activities close to bed. Over time this got better because I played soccer late last year in the evenings on Fridays, I had a "prolonged" heartbeat but this went down with time and was able to sleep even after this. I'm not certain whether this is all is caused by OCD, which I definitely have. I'm superstitious and this creates a self fullfilling prophesy "E.g. do this or you wont sleep". But I'm also not sure if maybe i have an underlying heart/nervous/anxiety condition? I went for a heart ultrasound and got a holter put on me last fall and the results were normal, apparently i have a very strong heart. Also, when i was younger i used to play lots of soccer, even late at night and never had an issue falling asleep. Was my heart stronger then in which maybe my BPM was between 45-55 when i was resting? meaning i didnt notice the heart beat so much. Is the solution literally just to do more sprints and cardio, which would reduce my heartrate even further? I do go to the gym and have been working out in the past year. Although when all this started last year I was not physically active. Since I was younger \*18-19) I have probably put on 30-40 pounds, I'm 5 ft 9, Male, 22 and 190 lbs if that makes any difference. Should I hop off zoloft and talk to my doc about taking a beta blocker like propanolol? Only thing is my heart beat is still relatively low, it's not like its in the 130's where a beta blocker would be given.Again, thanks so much for reading and I'd appreciate any insight.
NotSignal	Every now and then when I go to sleep without drinking or smoking I find it super hard to go to sleep and stay asleep. I almost always wake up from nightmares and sleep paralysis and it’s near impossible to get back to sleep. Is this problem normal?
NotSignal	How can it be so easy to nod off on a long motorway journey, doing 70mph, with music on, windows open, danger everywhere but as soon as you're home in a comfy warm bed, it's impossible. Note: when I say fall asleep on the motorway I mean feel yourself going, not actually taking a snooze!
NotSignal	My dad is having neurosurgery tmrw at an ungodly early time but obviously my m sis and I will be there for pre-op. His response was “no no I have to have my head shaved and given goofy drugs and it’s very early. Stay home. Get a good nights sleep” HAHAHAHAHA omg dad I had no idea how hilarious you are.
NotSignal	Am I correct to say we can't sleep because of anxiety? What exactly are you anxious about?
NotSignal	The last 6 days I’ve *barely* gotten 4 hours of sleep each night. Now tonight I was able to fall asleep around 2am with no medication, just to be rudely awoken by 2 family members arguing and yelling at each other and then my mom slamming her door. I texted her about how she just caused me to probably only get 2 hours of sleep tonight on top of the last extra shitty 6 days I’ve already gotten. She responded by saying “fuck you!” Classy. I’ll be lucky if I fall back asleep.
Signal	My insomnia became unmanageable more than 3 years ago and since then I was prescribed Trazodone. It's been very helpful even at 50-100mg a night and I don't have much issue sleeping now. But, my latest doctor seemed worried that I might develop a dependency and a tolerance. I've obviously emailed him with these questions, but am curious what others think:Should I wean off? It's working and it's a very low dosage so maybe it's no big deal. I'm probably making a big deal out of literally nothing.Should it feel urgent to wean off? I am graduating college soon and am worried that once I start working I would need it even more, so now feels like my only chanceHow should I wean off? I've tried not taking it but I end up giving up at 3am and taking it anyways.
Signal	For some months now I’ve been on this combination of antidepressants that works really well for my anxiety and depression, but causes some sleep issues as a side effect. I take 200mg Zoloft and 150mg Wellbutrin, which are both known to be quite activating. Nevertheless due to having tapered them up very carefully and allowed my body to readjust to the different dosages I had been able to manage the mild insomnia quite well until now.However recently I’ve been experiencing some of that stress inherent to moving out as I’ll be going off to college very soon. And said anxiety and just generally feeling quite overwhelmed by the incoming changes and responsabilities paired with the aforementioned pre-existing issues has made it very very difficult to get any rest. I am exhausted, my brain is mush atm tbh - I’ve been consistently getting less then 4-5 hours a night - yet it’s 6am and I still haven’t been able to catch any zzzzz’s tonight :((
Signal	I'm having another night of getting little sleep. The past 3 weeks I've been sleeping during the day and staying up at night. I've had enough of this because I'm missing out on important things I need to do during the day. Yesterday, I had only 4 hours of sleep (from 4 am to 8 am), I was still sleepy from only getting 4 hours. I decided instead of sleeping in the afternoon, I would wait until night to sleep. I went to bed at 9pm and some idiot in my house thought it was a good idea to vacuum at night. This woke me up and I haven't been able to sleep since at least 1 am. I tried taking valerian tea and chamomile tea, reading a book, and watching a movie but I still can't sleep. I'm stressed about not sleeping which is also making it hard to sleep. Now it's 7 am What should I do?
Signal	After a few months of at least getting some sleep every night, I messed up and decided to drink too much on NYE. Because of this, I ended up nauseous and ended up getting no sleep whatsoever. Now my nausea is pretty much gone, but my lack of sleep has resulted in pretty bad anxiety. Waiting for the night to come is literal torture (I’m waiting until the night to go to sleep so that my sleep schedule doesn’t get messed up). I’ll probably have to use Ambien that my doctor prescribed a couple months ago. Everything will be ok, right?
Signal	I have been having anxiety related insomnia for the past 2 weeks like manic spin of fear and confusion with days of not sleeping. My doc gave me trazadone and it made my nose stuffy and I didn't sleep on it plus I am taking buspurine. Today just 2 days later I called and explained I still didn't sleep and they gave me short term low dose Seroquel for sleep and anxiety. It seems to have a lot of mixed reviews and bad research stats. Does anyone have experience with this? I just need a few nights of sleep to stop the spin and get back on track the whole coronavirus bs really set me into a dark pit of anxiety and insomnia. Also I'm sober and can't really take benzos so I just am looking to see if anyone has information or experience for it working for them?
NotSignal	None of the dreams are related to each other except for the fact that they’re nightmares. I’ve been into lucid dreaming for years and have gotten used to what it feels like to be dreaming, and I’d say in almost every dream I have, I’m aware to some extent it’s not real, and I have control over the dreams. Sometimes I play along, but I know that I’m not awake. In this past week though, weird shits been going on when I sleep. I wake up intermittently throughout the night (5 or 6 times) with EXTREMELY vivid dreams that are incredibly realistic, to the point I’m confused about why I’m in bed. I’m writing this post after the most intense one just happened. I seriously fell asleep 20 minutes ago for the night, and just had a full dream that took me all throughout my home town, and was extremely intricate and vivid. A really long dream and I can recollect the whole thing. It’s like I’m immediately just thrown into these dreams now, I thought you could only dream during REM sleep? None of this has ever happened to me before and it’s kind of startling. To make matters worse, they’re nightmares. I barely ever have had nightmares in the past, and they were extremely uncommon. Now, in these sort of chain type things, I have incredibly vivid, realistic nightmares that feel like they go on for hours, then I’ll wake up and it’s been 15-20 minutes. Then I’ll fall back asleep and it’ll happen again. All throughout the night. It’s seriously starting to take a toll on me and I don’t know what the fuck is going on. This last one that just woke me up was so bad that it seriously almost left me crying by the time it was over out of fear. They feel SO real. Is this at all normal? I am on vacation right now so my sleep schedule is a bit out of wack due to time zone changes and what not, but besides that it’s the only change I’ve made to my sleep and I’m still getting ~8 hours a night.
NotSignal	How do I fix my sleeping time, In the past couple weeks when my school got suspended and no reason to wake up early, I always ended up sleeping 2-3 am and wake up 7-8 am and take a nap at afternoon for like 2-3 hours.
NotSignal	How does being exhausted seem to affect your guys mind socializing? Obviously you’re tired and can’t muster up the energy to talk but like how does it effect conversation and speaking with others? Do you move and walk more slowly?
Signal	Went to bed at 10 pm, fell asleep fine, but woke up randomly at 2 am, then fell back asleep at 3 am, woke up at 5 am and since then I haven't been able to sleep. I feel like I've had all the energy sucked from me and I literally feel sick.Shit part is I have school tomorrow and need to get shit done. :/
NotSignal	I finally slept for 7 hours a night for the first time this year. Last week I slept over 6 hours a night every night and I just feel so relieved! CBT-I really is working miracles for me. Ever since I lost my job earlier in the year, I was averaging only about 4 hours a night with some nights of complete sleeplessness. Reading posts here kept me sane and the one kind user here that suggested CBT-I and recommended an app is an angel <3
Signal	Hello everyone,I am a long time ambien user and insomniac.For the past 2 or 3 months I've been taking 20 mg per night.Helps with falling asleep initially.Around 11 am.But I always, ALWAYS wake up at 1 am, go to the kitchen and end up EATING!BINGE EATING, to be precise.It's horrible.This drug takes away ALL self control.In an ambien-induced stupor I have often consumed around 3,000 to 4,000 calories in one sitting.Usually carbs or fat-laden foods like:Tubs of butter,Loaves of bread,Jam,Peanut butter,Bananas,Yoghurt,Tubs of Soup,Chocolate protein bars,Cereal,... More chocolate protein bars,All washed down with gallons of milk!Feels awful the next day as you can imagine.I know ...There's another sub-Reddit for this type of thing ... (Night eating / binge eating)... but I'm SICK of ambien ... I hate the nasty, unpredictable side effects ...... one of which is 'night eating'.I have even driven the car are to the nearest store for treats.... So I ticked all the boxesAmbien is cunning, baffling and powerful. (As they might say in 12 Step literature)I CAN'T sleep without it having developed an awful dependency.I need to quit.Any advice on going how to taper?... Or go cold turkey?I've quit zopiclone before (high doses)But Ambien is a different beast.In my opinion.Ps. I also take MELATONIN, VALERIAN, L-TRYPTOPHAN, B6, MAGNESIUM at night ...Helps anxiety.But doesn't quite have the 'sledgehammer' effect of a Z Drug like Ambien.I want to be free of sleeping pills completely ---- at least while in quarantine.It's a great opportunity.Any advice appreciated.Thanks.
NotSignal	So I have a really hard time falling asleep and it seems like when I do it’s really hard for me to fall into deep sleep? I always have these really weird dreams that are connected to real life. And somehow these dreams are connected (time wise) because it’s a little like living what happened again in your life. Occasionally if I have a nightmare there’s always another part ii the next night or something like that. Anyone else experienced this? Sorry for my poor explanation. It’s hard to describe the situation.
NotSignal	I have an overactive immune system (autoimmune diseases) that usually prevents me from getting sick. It's been several years since I've had a cold last for more than a day and a half. I'm still feeling the effects of this one a week and a half later. I rode my bike when it was especially cold out. I didn't wear much because I wanted to expose myself to the cold, but it ended up getting much colder than I expected. The next day I started to get sick and I'm still recovering from it. The weird thing is I've had absolutely no trouble getting to sleep since I got sick. Within an hour or two of getting to bed, I'm asleep. So go out and do naked snow angels. French kiss a dirty hobo. Get yourself some sick and maybe you'll get good sleep, too.
Signal	I haven't slept well for almost 2 years now, everytime I do fall asleep I wake up again after a few hours and It always takes me hours to go to sleep even if I don't go online, close my eyes, drink milk, etc, does anyone get this? I've never been diagnosed because I don't talk to anyone about it but I probably do have insomnia. What about you guys?
Signal	I hope this is okay here. I don’t have a diagnosed sleep disorder but I do have GAD and it affects my sleep in a really bad way sometimes. I sort of go through phases. The last couple of months I’ve been really extremely high anxiety and I haven’t been able to sleep. The last two weeks especially. I do everything right. Meditate, exercise, little caffeine, eat right. Yet every single night I am up tossing and turning and in extreme pain and unable to sleep. It’s 4 am and I’m just laying here. I can’t shut my brain off. I have so much to do tomorrow and I’m just going to be exhausted. I’ve been in bed for five hours. I want to cry and scream and throw things. But mostly I just want to sleep.
Signal	I've told my family that if I become worse like a vegetable unable to sleep again they should find a way to put me down. I can't afford any doctors to check if I have sfi or anything else that is causing my insomnia. All I know im losing weight with every sleepless night, I sweat profusely and have memory and thinking problems because of lack of sleep. But even before when I was getting 10 h sleep I had concentration problems don't know why because this pandemic started and clinics shut down. If my brain doesn't want to sleep im going to sleep permanently with a noose. I hope if there is a god he forgives me.
NotSignal	Noticed a weird phenomenon,my laptop charger broke recently but previously playing video games on my laptop for about 15 minutes during an insomnia episode, I was continually able to sleep through the night,I have no idea why,my phone doesn’t have the same effect,reading doesn’t have the same effect,nor does talking to someone.
Signal	I have huge anxiety to sleep, both getting to sleep aswell as when I wake up in the night (always at the same time) and I can therefore never get more than 4 or 5 hours of sleep. I believe the waking up is middle Insomnia or something, caused by anxiety. Can fluoxetine help reduce that, so that I can stay asleep and not wake up, which has been going on for weeks now.
Signal	workout dailylimiting coffeemelatonin before bed...going to bed at the same time daily&#x200B;no progress. i don't know what else to do. i just lay in bed non stop.
NotSignal	Its 3 in morning and I'm awake again,Sitting up in my bed trying to pretend.That I'm in the mountains, on a white snowy day.Where all of my problems are so far away.But it doesn't matter where I may be,The problems arise, because I am the problem you see. Why do I make things hard in my life? Why do I ruin anything that's alright. I dont understand what is the matter, with my stupid mind that cant stop its chatter. It thinks when it shouldn't and not when it should. It thinks only the bad, but never the good. It keeps me awake all through the night, it keeps telling me I'm never right. Day by day... night by night my mind is slowly winning it's own fight. The only way I can combat the noise is to numb my mind from feelings with things it enjoys. Having nothing to feel, my mind is not cheerful. Its not sad, it's not mad, it's not anxious or fearful. It is but a mind, all alone all the time, with no one to talk to, it just writes in rhyme. Maybe writing some words may slow my mind down, maybe these words wont make it sound like a clown. Iv chosen it's better to keep my mind quiet rather than try, to keep up with the speed that it goes, and to think about all of the woes that it knows. I hope that one day it may find focus and balance, without needing me feeding its allowance. There will be bad days, as well as good, as long as I know my minds likelyhood, to tell me I can not, when I know that I can. That feeling these feelings isn't for me man. I just need to tell it that with sadness comes cheer, and that feelings come and they go, and they are nothing to fear. I just need to be careful as my mind has many tricks to make think it needs to be fixed. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but I cant know for sure by keeping it quite. I must let my mind start to feel all of the things that connect it to others. other minds other people where it can release all the noise that I try so hard to keep at peace. If I surpress it forever, I will never have anyone, I will have kept my mind quiet and it will have won.
Signal	I have ADHD and Anxiety I have a bad sleep schedule tried Melatonin and zzzquil for a bit and it helps me sleep but not get a full 8 hours and i its been weeks since Ive got a full nights rest i usually get 2-5 hours of sleep at max and often i cant tell if i have sleep I Need Help or advice im 17 and 147 pounds and im a male
NotSignal	So I usually listen to mildly interesting YouTube videos in order to fall asleep to keep my brain occupied yet still be able to close my eyes and relax. Do you guys do this or something similar? If so, what do you listen to? I’m open to a wide variety of media (podcasts, tv, etc) & topics as I’m a nerd who loves to learn. I can’t stand the whispering in ASMR though. I really like LGR, Barely sociable, Jon Solo, Nexapro & Trey the explainer.
NotSignal	I normally get 8-10 hours each night simply due to how i have slept everynight for the last 8 years. But last night (jan 4th leading into 5th) i was unable to fall asleep all boght. And after going through the day without so much as a yawn, i feel that i will mot be falling alseep to ight either. Is it safe to assume this is insomnia? And if yes, why has my body suddenly decided that it thinks it can go 48hours without sleep.
Signal	I've had difficulty getting to sleep my entire life, on a perfect night it generally takes me an hour of lying there to get to sleep, but often it's closer to 2 hours. It's something that I've just learned to deal with, I go to bed earlier and I'm fine.But starting 4 months ago I had started having a new problem of waking up too early. I'd wake up consistently after 6 hours of sleep, which definitely isn't enough for me. I've been in a constant state of cranky exhaustion since. I've tried a number of sleeping pills, which tended to work for a week or 2 and then I'd be right back to waking up after 6 hours of sleep.I started seeing a CBTi therapist a week ago, I just finished my observation week and had my 2nd appointment. But here's the thing, I actually had a great week of sleep during the observation period, which was new. I had 5 nights where I slept 7-8 hours, and 2 where I woke up early. I told her this definitely hasn't been normal and she recommended we start sleep restriction therapy. I have a pretty long drive I have to make tomorrow night, so I've been waiting to start until after that. And again, I had some good nights of sleep.So I'm conflicted. On one hand, I've been dealing with this so long I want to be proactive and do something. I actually quit my job over it, I had some what of a nervous break down because I didn't understand what was going on. And the anxiety of if it's going to happen again is horrible. On the other hand I'm worried if I start this it's going to retrain my brain to start waking up early, the time I'm supposed to get up at isn't far off from what I was waking up at in the first place.What should I do? Is sleep restrictive therapy any good for early morning awakenings? I'm not finding much about it online.
Signal	I was on a really good sleeping streak, but now it’s all gone to shit. Before al of this, I was falling asleep at half-ten ish and waking up every morning at 7. I’ve been an insomniac since I was a newborn baby, and the sleeping pattern I had before the lockdown was the best one I’ve ever had.My depression was gone. My acne was gone. My heart-palpitations, anxiety attacks and hallucinations were gone.But now, I might as well have never slept in my life. It’s like I forgot how to fall asleep allover again. I do the breathing and muscle techniques, I leave my phone, laptop, and even my goddamn 3ds in the kitchen before I go to bed.Last night, I got so desperate that I tried to make myself pass out, just so I could be unconscious for a few minutes. Obviously, it didn’t work, I just got too scared as soon as my vision started fading, and boom. I was wide-awake again.It’s ridiculous. The lack of sleep is making me go crazy. Making me do crazy things.How is everyone else coping? I see other people on this subreddit saying their sleep has actually improved because of the lockdown. If you’re one of those people, please give me some advice. I’m desperate.
Signal	Preface: I’m seeing a private doctor on Monday because this is getting bad for me but I’ve been contemplating the ER again. (I say again, read below). I’ve been having issues with broken sleep for a few months now but I’ve always been able to get at least 6-7 hours most nights, albeit broken, but I was still refreshed enough in the morning to go about my day. I chalked it up mostly to my “ibs” and anxiety as when my gut was upset so was my sleep. I had a few episodes of feeling like my heart stopped or something as I went to fall asleep and this would have me grabbing my pulse ox to check and then I’d switch on the tv for a bit I eventually started sleeping on the downstairs couch for a bit as a change of scenery and because Netflix was downstairs. This worked for a while and so I alternated between couch and bed depending on how upset my gut and how high my anxiety was. Hasn’t been the best few months but I was getting my hours of sleep in and my weight was stable at 9 st 5 lbs since the end of last year. However last Sunday night when we had the hot weather come in (UK, 30 degrees Celsius), all hell has broken loose and I’m scared as hell. I woke Monday morning with full on Diarrhoea and absolutely no sleep the night before. I felt rotten but forced myself to eat food during the day. Monday night, maybe a couple hours of sleep, didn’t feel like I slept at all. Tuesday I was dehydrated so admitted myself to the ER and they gave me fluids and ran a CBC, liver and kidney function, and inflammation and infection markers, nothing. Was discharged after my fluids. Felt angry because they dismissed my horrendous bowel discomfort and lack of sleep. But I get it, they’re the ER. They just want to make sure you’re not dyingBut following Tuesday. Holy shit I feel rotten (I’m guessing because of the sleep deprivation. My appetite was diminished anyway because of these gut issues, but I was eating enough to sustain my weight without too much trouble. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday it feels like I’ve barely slept, and will probably be the same tonight. I try not to think about it but it probably will happen. I’ve dropped from 9st 5 pounds in the morning to just over 9 this week alone, once the day is done I’m around 9:4 on the scales after what food and fluids I can manage. I’m not dehydrated (peeing almost clear) The disorientation and brain fog is horrendous, I feel like I’m not breathing properly, vision not focusing properly when I’m out on a short walk. My heart is racing super fast doing almost nothing and the nausea is horrific. Forcing myself to eat at this point. I’ve no idea what has triggered my sleep to become so piss poor and I’m so scared. This week has been the longest week of my life. Time goes by sooooooo slowly now, feels like a matter of time before something has got to give
NotSignal	While it has never occurred twice in a row, thankfully, but it is occurring more and more. It often happens when I go and attempt to sleep at a later time, such as 4 AM.
Signal	Every day erects the same process, I lay in bed and immediately start thinking everything because I am not a constant state of foing anything else. I can't stop thinking and I am not able to focus on falling asleep, I just lay there in bed and try to augment my brain to go to bed but all is futile as I start thinking about something else. The best way I found to help me was to mentally tire myself out by doing and loading multiple mental tasks and exercises at one, to the point where my brain becomes fatigued, but that technique hasnt worked anymore, simply because I myself cant allocate my focus for it. Any suggestions?
Signal	I haven't slept since Sunday. I don't mean I've had broken sleep, but the last time I actually slept was Sunday night. Tried to nap Monday, nothing. Tried to sleep last night, nothing. Tried to sleep twice today, nothing.I have occasional bouts of insomnia, but this time is different because I'm not the least bit tired - a little fatigued, but not sleepy. Which is weird because I've been yawning for the last 24 hours, but my body just won't sleep. And I haven't had any coffee or drugs or any other stimulants. I've never had this happen before.I don't know if I should be worried about this or not. I've tried over the counter sleep aids like melatonin and Benadryl as well as breathing exercises and all that. Never helped before and isn't helping now. I figure eventually I'll get tired, but it's kind of unsettling to feel this way.
Signal	Last night was my first true fight with insomnia. I've always had issues getting to sleep then staying asleep once the dark room consumed me. New medication has mixed effect of drowsiness in the day time and insomnia at night. Terrible combination in all reality. In total, I had roughly 2 hours of actually sleep broken apart like the remnants of a forgotten bastion by constantly feeling nauseous. Hopefully it passes as my body regulates to the medication. Like a beaten but far from defeated pugilist, I carry on still.
Signal	Tried sleeping at 1 am today when I normally sleep at 4-5 am and it’s now 3:20 am and I still can’t sleep. Need to wake up early and I already know my day of productiveness is completely ruined. I just can’t bring myself to sleep and I’m frustrated I can’t sleep on time anymore. Any tips on sleeping better?
NotSignal	Just wanted to share – as we know, part of what makes insomnia self-fulfilling is the anxiety about how long it's going to take you to sleep / whether or not you will even fall asleep. What I've been doing the past few months is counting backwards from 1000 in my head. If I get distracted, I start back from 1000. I rarely get past 960 before falling asleep. Hope it helps some of you too. Now I just need to figure out how to _stay_ asleep.
NotSignal	For the last 3 nights when I lay down to go to sleep my body just goes numb and I feel a burning sensation everywhere. Idk what’s causing this. I don’t know if it’s because my sleep schedule is shit rn. I’ve been going to sleep after 5 the entire quarantine and I’ve been feeling tired throughout the day. Idk if it’s finally catching up or what. Anybody else experiencing or have experienced something like this?
Signal	Long story short, I've been a chronic insomniac for most of my life and have been completely dependent on medication to sleep for nearly 20 years. Not surprisingly, I suffer from anxiety too. I literally do not fall asleep unless I take an Ambien (current dose 12.5mg) and possibly other drugs as well. That currently includes quetiapine, klonopin, and over-the-counters; I have tried literally over a dozen drugs since 2001. It's been so many years since I've "fallen asleep" on my own, I don't even remember what that's like. Even with the drugs, I'm barely getting by. I have a job and little kids at home and my schedule is bananas. In every other way I'm a health nut and I exercise a ton. I stay active socially, etc. I'm completely functional for work and social purposes, but psychologically I'm struggling hard right now. &#x200B;I started seeing a sleep therapist for CBT-i (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) a couple months ago but somehow just can't seem to commit to the program. I know it's my own fault that I'm not gaining any traction because I'm afraid to change some deeply-ingrained behaviors and give up some things that are important to me. This isn't my first rodeo. My therapist says that things can change and people DO get better, but I'm feeling kind of hopeless and defeated. &#x200B;I've never met anyone who's situation is as long-standing as mine. I'm hoping to hear from someone(s) who can relate or maybe find even an accountability partner for therapy. Kind words of all types are appreciated.
NotSignal	I've had insomnia for as long as i can remember, is it normal to feel pain during the day through many parts of the body?
Signal	Hi ! In the past 2 years I've been suffering from depression. I would sit all day on the computer or on the bed and do nothing besides smoke weed and watch pointless stuff or play games. My sleep schedule was completely messed up. I used to go to sleep after 12 at noon and wake up at 7-8 o clock at night. Lately I am trying to fight my depression, I started wokring out again and trying to find a job. The problem is, I cannot sleep more than 2-3 hours without waking up. My quality of sleep is really poor. I assume it's because my sleep hours where like so messed up that now that I'm trying to sleep more reasonable hours my body simply just can't. This is so annoying and it makes me feel like a zombie all day. If it continiues like this I think my depression will relapse. I've tried sleep meds in the past but they give me lots of side effects and still don't feel refreshed after a pill sleep. Anybody got any ideas how to fight this or any motivational stories because I'm starting to lose my sanity here... Thanks a lot for your time.
NotSignal	1. I couldn’t sleep at all last night, how do I stay awake until the desired bed time?2. I somehow ended up staying up pretty late. How do I sleep without oversleeping?3. After getting little to no sleep, I ended up sleeping through most of or a good chunk of the day. What do I do now?That’s all I can think of for now, but I’ll edit the post if more come to mind.
NotSignal	For most of my life I have been a good sleeper. I would have rare bouts where I didn’t sleep due to excitement, anxious about the next day of work school etc. Tonight I was up at my family’s cottage and I was worried everyone would fall asleep before me and seeing them sleep would make my anxiety about sleep worse. I didn’t sleep till about 430 am and woke up at 830. I hope I did not lose my ability to sleep.
NotSignal	Why is this not a thing yet?I think it would be atleast comforting to be chatting to fellow insomaniacs who can understand every bit of what we’re going through which the vanilla world obviously can’t
Signal	Haven't had a normal rest in a week, I'm able to sleep 3hrs tops, and even if I managed to sleep all night I still feel like shit.Not only insomnia, but I have anxiety attacks, both during day and night.Add to that emotional fragility that stems from lack of sleep. I feel like I'm at verge of madness.I have an appointment with psyhiatrist on friday and it's the only thing that keeps me going.
Signal	I don’t know what’s going on but it’s been 8 months now dealing with non restorative sleep.I feel like I’m awake all night and have the hardest time drifting off.Im restless throughout the night and wake up anywhere from 20-25 times.Anyone experience sticky skin due to lack of sleep?I feel like I’m dying because of this but hope I’m notI just want to sleep a solid 12 hours and reset my body but I don’t know how to
NotSignal	I know there are others here that have it worse but I've been awake for over 30 hours and I just want to pass out. It's not that I feel terrible. Oddly I don't feel as bad as I usually do when I can't sleep. It's just the stress over not sleeping. I feel like I have a knot in my stomach. Not sure if it's the stress or because I ate too much. I'm on the living room couch hoping I'll have better luck sleeping here.
NotSignal	Is there anyone here in the UK who relies on CBD products to sleep? I've certainly heard a lot recently about how much it helps people. I'd love to give it a try but I'm so utterly put off by the crazy prices (£70 for a bottle of gummies!).I'm hesitant to try it out because I've tried herbal things before and they've done literally nothing.I'm also trying to get the right stuff. Certainly you can find "CBD" products on Amazon but when you look closer all of it seems to be hemp oil and not proper CBD oil (despite what the label says).Can anyone recommend a trustworthy place to buy CBD products that doesn't cost a crazy amount to try it out?Thanks.
Signal	Most of the time i try to sleep early coz I'm usually tired the next day I used to sleep at about 11pm and wake up at 5am. In winter it's usually really easy to get to sleep than other seasons. Sleep early, wake up early that was my motto.Nowadays I get tired at 7pm,fall asleep at 9pm and sleep gone at 2am. Fall back to sleep at 4am and have to wake up at 5:30am.Im really tired of this
NotSignal	Hey,i have a quick question for you.How long have you been without sleep?For me is 5 days
NotSignal	I love staying up for ≈30 hours because it's so satisfying to get in bed and fall asleep in like 15\~30 minutes instead of 2 hours.
Signal	I think it started as me just wanting to stay up to watch more of a show, I could because of quarantine. It started getting to the point where I couldn’t go to sleep any earlier than 4:00. Around this time I also started becoming extremely depressive and I think the irregular sleep hasn’t helped. I tried taking Valerian Root, laying in the dark for hours. I got someone to wake me up early consistently, but my body refused to go to sleep any earlier. I also think it may have something to do with the fact my body is very used to me spending all day working physically and mentally, and I can’t do that to the same regard with quarantine and school being over. Does anyone have any ideas?Edit: I naturally wake up at 12:00-2:00 with this sleep pattern, no alarm will wake me up properly
Signal	If you search for insomnia medication, Pregabalin rarely comes up. But if you look at Pregabalin research, it's positive effect on sleep is mentioned a lot, and unlike hypnotics, you don't build up a tolerance to it. Is this a forgotten medication when it comes to insomnia?I got onto Pregabalin as I suffer generalised anxiety. I tried SSRIs and they reduced my anxiety but made my sleep worse, so I was moved onto Pregabalin which improved my anxiety and my sleep.
NotSignal	Not sure how to describe the feeling other than strange death like. I get this strange feeling like if I don't move my body to a different position something bad will happen. The feeling usually starts in my lower body and travels up my stomach to chest. There's some anxiety with it and a little panic although I'm used to it now it doesn't bother me much anymore. What's interesting is I almost look forward to the feeling now as after it happens I typically fall asleep quickly after. Does anyone else experience something similar?
NotSignal	Does anyone have insomnia hobbies? Like things that seem super boring/dumb to you right now, but the second it’s 12am and you can’t sleep, it’s suddenly the most interesting thing in the world. For me it’s painting haha
NotSignal	And then my boyfriend picked up his roommate from the airport. They were using power tools at fucking 3 am. It’s now 4 am and they’re blasting music, completely oblivious to the fact I’m in a murderous mood toward them right now.I left to go to the gas station for some food, but I’m genuinely thinking of not going back. The relationship is relatively new, but this is a borderline deal breaker. I know I’m being dramatic but fuck, I’m so tired. I’ve been through hell the last few weeks, and I just drifted off into sleep when they came crashing through the door. I dint have to work tomorrow but I have to be “awake” in 3 hours for some other adulting duties. Sorry for the vent, but I’m tired and lonely and pissed.
Signal	I get insomnia, inertia lack of motivation for such a shit dead end job and they know that but they’re all about their terms and conditions. They kinda set me up as well but either way I say honesty is best policy. I hate lying anymore so I just don’t do it. There were some inconsistencies in what I said about going to the doctors and them still being available if I really cared about fixing etc. I just don’t know how to stop the pressure of being late :/
NotSignal	I doze during the day, fibromyalgia fatigue, but am often awake half the night. Lucky for me I am retired. I enjoy the night instead of worrying and counting the hours of sleep I am not getting. Watch a bit of Netflix, Reddit tales on You Tube, knitting, sometimes bake cookies at two in the morning! Today I am still awake at dawn! I did doze off a bit. I have a recliner chair and a whole lot of cushions so I can have my feet up and support where my hurty bits are. It is now five am and I am drinking coffee, taking my meds and have just sat outside to watch the sky slowly lightening up. I recorded the dawn chorus of the birds in my garden. My family get cross with me for my weird sleep habits but, like I said, I’m lucky as I don’t have to worry about work. I do get my husbands breakfast around eight am before he shuts himself in our home office to work. !!!!
Signal	I don’t know how many hours I have gone without sleeping but I am sure it’s close to 35 or more. I took a shower earlier this morning and felt my eyes drift back and I felt like I lost all sense of consciousness for a split second. I’m currently at work crying just wanting to home so I can try to fucking sleep bc this is making me paranoid as all hell
Signal	Every night I do the same routine. I get in bed around 10 ish, play a video game for a bit, then put on some youtube since it soothes me and take melatonin. If the melatonin isn't working I go for something slightly stronger like Trazodone. I'm trying to fall asleep by 11:30 pm but end up tossing and turning for hours, sometimes till 2 am. It's like I have trouble finding a comfortable position, and I will continuously flip my pillow trying to find a cold side I guess. Last night it took me till 2 am again, and I finally stopped tossing and turning when I brought the weighted blanket on the bed and fell asleep 30 minutes later. The thing is I don't feel too stressed, and thoughts will try to come into my mind but I can generally block them.
NotSignal	So I suffer from intermittent bouts of insomnia, usually as a result of stressing about money (trying to raise three kids on one income). I’d stay up all night worrying, trying to plan, putting things on craigslist etc. sometimes for days or weeks on end. I found a solution that’s free and works 100% of the time for me.Hogan’s Heroes. The TV show. I can turn it on at bedtime and watch it (I actually really enjoy it) and when I’m ready to sleep it just knocks me right out. Literally out in 2-3 mins when I decide it’s time to call it quits. I’ve never had luck watching TV to sleep before. It’s incredibly calming, I’m not sure if it’s the content or the sound it makes or what but man does it work for me. Give it a try, maybe it’ll help someone else.
Signal	Sorry if this post is a bit of a mess. I'm exhausted right now but the moment I turn out the lights I get wide awake. I've had severe sleep problems my entire life, but before a certain age it was more manageable. I used to have something similar to mild traditional insomnia. Over the past few years, I've lost control. My sleep issues have gotten worse.I'm utterly exhausted for days. The daytime lethargy has been going on for about 4 years. It's been disabling. I don't really have 24 hour insomnia as I can easily sleep in the morning to the afternoon despite, but I feel horrible doing this. I can force myself to sleep at night by taking melatonin despite being tired the entire day afterwards.Based on recommendation, I have also tried to fix my sleep schedule by staying up all night and the whole next day (which I've had recommended as a solution), but not only does it not work, I end up developing mania as I have a mood disorder, which then causes more severe insomnia. Even if my schedule temporarily fixes itself, which sometimes occurs, it will just shift back to the daytime within a few days. I also just found out that I misread the bottle and I was taking double the recommended dose of melatonin for months, and I can't go to sleep at night without it, but I think my excessive use is causing various physical problems. I have vivid dreams/nightmares at night. Additionally, I've been taking it for years, almost every single day. I did this with full assurance that there are no side effects and no ability to accidentally overdose.It feels like the sun causes tiredness and darkness causes wakefulness. Any advice, not for the mania of course, but just a possible diagnosis or similar experiences? Does melatonin actually have this effect? I'm really convinced a lot of my mental disorders are caused by very long term sleep deprivation going back years.
Signal	Im already on a cocktail of medication for multiple things, sleeping pills dont work very well except make me drowsy but i cant fall asleep. Iv been trying to get a healthy sleep schedule but its very difficult when Im up for days at a time and only sleep 3hrs max, then I finally crash atleast once a week and have a 12+hr sleep.I feel like my sleep will never be normal and it worries me as I realise how important sleep is.Did any natural ways help you sleep such as routines or products? That I could possibly try.
NotSignal	It feels like all I do at this point is do research and go to doctors and try different lifestyles, diets, and medications. It's become all consuming I feel like I piss people off when I bring it up at this point. I'm dreading the fact that my uni starts up in less than 2 weeks. The exhaustion from last semester really made me want to drop out or hurt myself. I just feel like there's no solution for me, like I'm just meant to be up for a painful amount of time before I drop from the exhaustion.
Signal	I've been prescribed zopiclone to help me sleep, but have been experiencing strange side effects. The worst is auditory hallucinations. I hear people trying to wake me up, people muttering, and my husband having conversations in different rooms of the condo. Does anyone else have these issues? Do they go away? Should I just stop the medication?
NotSignal	Sometimes when I'm in a nightmare, I realize it's a dream so I start hitting myself or pulling my hair to wake myself up. I don't actually know if I'm hitting myself/pulling my hair irl. Then, I wake up. My eyes just jolt open. I don't sleep with anyone so I can't know if I'm actually hurting myself or not.Sometimes It feels like I pulled my hair, but, I can't be sure. What is this? It only happens when I'm in a bad dream and trying to get out.
NotSignal	Everyday, since the start of our Christmast break I started to sleep at 5-7 am and woke up from 1pm to almost 5 pm like I'm a night guard or something. Class is closing in on Jan 7. Yet All I do is procrastinate every damn time and not even try…
Signal	F / 26 / For some background, I've dealt with moderate and occasional sleeplessness my whole life - I'd guess my habits are probably slightly worse than the average person's, but usually not completely debilitating. I have anxiety/PTSD that can keep me up late - but not always. For years I abused alcohol in order to sleep (no longer - now I barely drink) and I have been prescribed various sleep meds, with moderate success.For a while, last winter/spring I finally reached a happy place with sleep - I could sleep well with just a CBD tincture, or often with no help at all. Then, after the death of my stepmother in June, I began taking hydroxyzine for sleep again - just 5 - 10 mg did the trick. I feel like I have never really regained control of my sleep since then, and my tolerance for the drug has only increased and increased. For the past two weeks, my sleep has been extremely disturbed, resulting in multiple all nighters and one miserable 48 hour stint awake. Hydroxyzine doesn't seem to be working anymore, even when I take a higher dosage of 30 - 50mg. I am currently exhausted and honestly dreading the idea of going to bed at night. However, my real question/issue is regarding my schedule, which I think is a big part of my issues. I work a food/beverage service job with wildly different hours every day. Some days I have to be up at 5am, and others I don't get home until 11pm. I think one of my major issues with sleep is not being able to create a regular routine for myself. I'm always going to bed or waking up at different times because of work. I suspect this is part of the reason I've been struggling the past few weeks/in general. I have a baseline sleep time of around 1030pm - 730am, but this inevitably gets thrown off due to having to get up earlier or stay up later. Does anyone work under similar circumstances or have any tips on creating a regular-ish routine in the face of an irregular schedule? (Other than getting a new job - which I am also considering.)Sorry if this is rambly - I've only slept a few hours in as many days. And thank you in advance!
Signal	I generally have issues getting wet during sex, always have. I noticed its even worse when im exhausted after having a series of insomnia episodes, Ive had insomnia since i was 5, theres always atleast one night a week i dont sleep and stay up for 2 days, this past week was 4 episodes back to back, so draining. does any oother women experience this and do you have any tips or tricks to help? I was thinking i should just start putting aloe up there every time prior to seeing my boyfriend? idk
Signal	I just want to rant and bitch and flail my arms for a little bit. No need to read this or even reply to it. I’m moving, I’m terrified I won’t be able to get my lunesta filled in California, I also only have one refill left. I’m currently down here apartment hunting and I need an address before I can sign up for Kaiser. I’m trying to conserve what lunesta I have left in case I can’t get more. Last night I thought it’d be safe to just take Seroquel along with my other meds and some CBD, but I just laid there in bed struggling to fall asleep until my alarm went off. At 4am I gave in and took 3mg which is double what I usually take in conjunction with Seroquel, and nothing, probably because the sun was about to come up. I JUST DON’T GET WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME. How the hell does Seroquel not knock me out? How the hell does 3mg Of lunesta not knock me out regardless of what time I took it?! What the fuck is wrong with my brain?! I have an apartment viewing in 45 minutes and this coffee is slowly bringing me back to life, but damn I feel defeated. I’m gonna make it through this day just fine, I always do, but even if I can get myself feeling good after staying awake all night I feel it takes a toll on my face, dark circles, looking like a druggie, that kind of shit. I’m just trying to present myself well to the potential new land lords
Signal	Sigh. I took my sleeping pills four hours ago. I can’t sleep. I have to be awake for work in less than seven hours. I didn’t sleep a wink last night, but took an hour nap yesterday during the day. I have a weighted blanket on me. My partner is here— so lessened anxiety. Why am I not able to sleep? What is wrong with me? This disordered sleep is killing me. I just yawned. This happens pretty much every night. I see my doctor tomorrow and am going to beg to be put on a higher dose or something. Why is this a constant in my life? 😑
Signal	It all comes down to how sensitive I am to sleep deprivation. I can sleep fine if I take my sleeping meds, but I can't sleep without them. If I try to get off them, I will get really bad rebound insomnia...I can't seem to tough through it. I feel like absolute ass If I go one day without sleep, my brain gets all foggy. I also get nauseous and anxious. I am not brave enough to go 2 days without sleep. I know that if I don't sleep for days, eventually my body will shut down and go to sleep. Once I go to sleep on my own without pills, I will gain the confidence in my body's own ability to sleep. But again, the only way to get through this is to suffer and go through brutal sleep deprivation to teach my body to sleep without pills. How do I get through this? How do I get the strength to tough it out?
Signal	Last week, I couldn’t sleep starting Monday night and by Saturday morning I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown after being up all week. I had caffeine twice just to function but that of course made going to sleep virtually impossible those two nights. I have avoided medication for years because I want my body to do what it’s supposed to do naturally which is fucking sleep and then have energy the next day, but I was so desperate that I took Trazodone Saturday night. I got sleep, not fully knocked out straight through the night sleep, but beggars can’t be choosers. And I was starting to feel normal again which is what mattered the most.After taking it for three nights, I decided to take a night off from it last night to avoid building a tolerance or dependency. The night started off promising - I was able to fall asleep in my bed (which has been an issue, too, I’ve been on the couch since Saturday night) and slept from sometime between 11:30 and midnight until a little after 4 AM. I woke up having to use the bathroom and didn’t want to get out of bed but did anyway. Now it’s past 6 AM, I have to be up in less than 30 minutes, and I have been wide ass awake since I went to the bathroom.I am so frustrated. I want to punch everything in this house, but I am equally defeated. I just want to go to sleep and stay asleep like a normal person. I don’t want to have to do 2700 rituals to go to bed. I don’t want to have to take medication, especially since it isn’t recommended long term. I want to be able to pee in the middle of the night and go back to sleep. I just want my stupid brain to do what it’s supposed to do.I have people in my life that are supportive and understanding, but I wanted to post here where people can actually relate. I have run the gambit on normal recommendations to get better sleep and I don’t trust my body anymore. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past and I hope that my brain doesn’t get back to that place, but I feel powerless to whatever is keeping me up at night and I fear that I will never have healthy sleep patterns where I can trust that my body will actually fall asleep and stay asleep when it’s supposed to. I just. Want. To sleep.
NotSignal	It's currently 4AM where I am right now, and I can't sleep a wink. I used to sleep like a baby from around 1AM to 8AM back in the US (EST). My new time zone is 9.5 hours ahead. The night I flew here, I had to pull an all nighter in an airport and as soon as I came here I was submerged in my remote college classes that usually end by 1AM.
NotSignal	I feel like I've taken insanely long, deep breaths in with this thing way more times than intended and it never once made me drowsy. I'm pretty sure I'm inhaling correctly. Does it just not work for some people?The good thing about this subreddit is, there's always someone awake this late XD
Signal	So I used to work overnights and did that for roughly 10 years. Ever since i left that job 2-3 years ago (and even while i was there) I've had constant problems with insomnia. I know that working nights can lead to shift work disorder and a disruption of the circadian rhythm but I had no idea it would persist for years after stopping.Has anyone else gone through something similar? Did it eventually get better?
Signal	Hi there 👋 I have really tough time each summer, can't fall asleep and wake up at 5-6 am each day cos of sunrise. Usually sleep in full dark, each noise wake me up. Started at 2mg of melatonin, didn't feel anything. Then was 6mg slow release formula it was comfortable, but later I run out of it and even decided I'm ok. In next 2 couple of weeks I suffer issues with sleep again.This time I offered 10 mg slow release, but bit afraid of it.Which one is the best and safe? Also your thoughts on melatonin after alcohol.Thanks.
Signal	For years, I've been occasionally using melatonin for sleep aid but it's basically been absolutely useless. I didn't really want to use anything stronger because I'm extremely health conscious but I can't take it anymore. I spend a lot of time working and my time is EXTREMELY valuable to me. I probably waste 8+ hours a week trying to fall asleep (not to mention the time "lost" from inefficiency due to being so sleepy). Has anyone here tried diphenhydramine?
NotSignal	Hello,So latelt i have been having trouble falling a sleep, and staying a sleep. The problem is, that during day time i can pretty much fall a sleep whenever i want, but when night comes my brain just goes full matrix mode. It become a heckin minecraft server of thoughts, my brain just floads me with thought from all kinds( artificial things,from being a superhero to being in a relationship with some hot chick, and everyrhing in between). The thing is that these thoughts are the trouble of sleeping, as during day i often have chores and work to do, so as soon as i lay my head anywhere for a second i fall a sleep, but when night time comes its impossible without 1-3 hours of laying in bed.I tried all the recomendations from not eating and drinking coffe past 18:00 to cleaning my bedroom and refreshing the air in it, nothing helped. I am also physicaly active during the day so i get tired.The weird thing is, its not just sleep that the ocean of thought in my brain is making hard. Most of the times i just cant focus on simple tasks (because of the thoughts, or daydreaming if you wanna call it that) like walking or cutting an onion, so i oftenly bump into things and people in my own house, or cut my self. Its like my brain is not in my body, like it refuses to live the real life that is around me and sticks to some made up universes.What should i do to overcome this s#ity state that im in.Many thanks for upcoming replays.
Signal	new to this sub, have had sleep problems for a while now but saying that is kind of irrelevant since i have been getting the “5 hours instead of 8” with some interruptions but lately, this past week i have only been able to get 1 hour then i wake up.. this goes on throughout the night. the cycle is never ending, and when i do sleep i get bad night terrors. Today i decided to try out melatonin to fix this short term sleep deprivation issue, it didnt do me any good. I took 10 mg at 9:30 pm its 2:00 am now. i took another 10 mg just now about 15 minutes ago and i cannot sleep despite my body feeling exhausted my mind cannot shut off :/ gonna keep trying ughhh
NotSignal	For the past 4 to 5 days, I haven't been able to fall asleep at around 7 and wake up at 1 pm. Now my body is kinda used to its new time zone and won't fall asleep no matter how early I lay down in bed. What should I do now :(
NotSignal	It’s not freezing cold, but it’s cold enough to where I get this weird sensation where I can feel my body and can’t stop thinking about how I can feel the cool air on my skin. Layers don’t really help because my face is always out. Fuck, this is one of the dumbest reasons for me to want to live on my own. I just want control of the temperature; something I don’t have in my current living situation. Sorry for the rant 😐
Signal	If I don’t fall asleep by around 9 AM that’ll be around officially been up for 48 hours I just wanna sleep. My mind is tired but my body isn’t. My eyes hurt but the rest of my body wants to move.
NotSignal	It was one day we’re I stayed up and now I can’t sleep normally. I am not getting a healthy amount and I feel like I can’t allow myself to sleep anymore. I started out staying up to 2-3 am but now I’m staying up to 4-5 am and have to wake up early for things.
Signal	Is it just me, or when after i’m awake for 36 hours and then I knockout and pass out for 11 or 12 hours (with no medication) I always feel so so much worse and tired than I did during my all nighter. I do feel well rested at all in fact the opposite. I wake up yawning and have the least energy and am more exhausted that ever before during my most sleepless periods. Is there something wrong with me?
NotSignal	I have what basically feels like total insomnia. It started with only being able to sleep a few hours then 2, now zip. Every time I try to fall asleep I get a small twitch or jerk and I’m wide awake or sometimes I’m just wide awake still and laying for hours. I honestly don’t know how I’m still functioning but it’s getting ridiculous how bad it is. Did anyone else suffer from something similar or going through the same thing?
NotSignal	Anyone have any suggestions for other medecations I could take? I haven't slept in 4 days and I just need to sleep for a bit.
NotSignal	I'll try and keep this brief. I live with my partner and she is currently about 1 month in to a period of pretty abysmal sleep. Typically it is - fall asleep fine, wake up \~45 mins later, achieve about 3 hours sleep max per night. Last night we hit a new low where no sleep was achieved until 4am and this was only about 1 hour. It is having a pretty devastating effect on her and I really want to help but don't know how. Here is what we have done so far;\- No screens in the bedroom\- regimented routine at bed (in bed for 9.30pm, lights out 10.30pm)\- meditation (headspace) through eyemask headphones {which came highly recommended tbf}\- cbd tea, lavender oil massage around jaw\- exercise in the evening \- eating meals earlier.For info, my partner is 25, in excellent health (otherwise) - we eat well and exercise \~8-10 times per week. Any suggestion is appreciated. In my view our next steps are; separate beds, a sleep clinic, cbd oil under the tongue, professional therapy. TL;DR - gf is unable to sleep despite us trying all the good stuff - suggestions please
NotSignal	This is probably a long shot. Back in the early 2000s, Ambien, the sleep med, released a free cd of sleep meditation. I thought, maybe about 10 years ago, I found the mp3 download of the cd, through Ambien. Or, I possibly had ripped the cd to my computer. The computer it was on died. Ever since, I have been trying to find it again. Does anyone remember this, or know where I can get a digital copy?It was a progressive muscle relaxation, with a woman's voiceI have found the original website via waybackmachine, but I am no closer to locating the files.https://web.archive.org/.../http://www.ambien.com/sleepcd/This is a cross post from r/helpmefind
NotSignal	Benadryl is really the only drug that has ever helped me and I’m considering taking it again until that new drug Dayvigo is released. Once I quit Benadryl cold turkey after 5 or 6 months of daily use, how long should I expect the rebound insomnia to last?
NotSignal	Has anyone added light nightly use of pot in conjunction with their evening routine? I was in a super happy place in my life with work, diet, exercise, trying to learn something new, and meditation. I was laid-off from work, it's seasonal work, so it wasn't unexpected. And I had two weeks off before I moved. In those two weeks, my diet went to shit, exercise went to shit, basically just became a bum. I also was smoking pot nightly and lightly to aide in meditation/relaxing in preparation for sleep. However, I also stopped that as I prepare for a new job. I was getting very restful and rejuvenating sleep. Now, I'm not. In those two weeks I've hardly gotten any sleep at all. Although I'm a total bum now, I've stuck close to my evening routine. I'm wondering could it be a mixture of all those changes in my life that could be the culprit or the weed. When I started smoking my sleep definitely improved, especially in getting my mind to relax. Or is it solely the abstinence from weed that's the culprit? What are your experiences?
NotSignal	Been struggling with sleep for past 6 months waking every 2 to 3 hours .. now if I get straight 4 hours I’m kinda ok with it .. hopefully it gets better one day
Signal	Been having panic attacks at night right as I start to doze off. Had them really bad a while ago and seems like everytime I get back to a good place randomly I'll have a shitty night and the effect lingers for days even weeks sometimes. The fear of sleeping or not sleeping idk anymore I just can't seem to shake this shit. I've been meditating, exercising, making lists, going to bed earlier than usual and not using my phone. This shit sucks and I hope to get some answers here soon idk if it's some sort of PTSD or just anxiety but I lay awake all night long with my heart racing every 5-10 minutes and I'm at my breaking point.
NotSignal	My sleep schedule is all over the place, made worse by the fact that I'm a night shift worker. I've been a "night owl" since I was a child, going to sleep at 4am and sleeping until 12pm, but I feel like maybe I've had some sleep disorder thats been undiagnosed? It feels different now, even when I finally want to sleep I can't, sometimes I sleep all day and other days I can only sleep 4hrs at a time.
Signal	I haven't had self harm/suicidal thoughts since October when I was hospitalized and my medication changed. Until we dropped remeron from my med combo and added trazodone. Then I was depressed. Then we added back the remeron but added lunesta and now about a month later I'm wanting to self harm, I'm suicidal, and I'm really depressed. The only difference between my meds now and my meds a few months ago when I was fine is the addition of lunesta. The problem is I couldn't sleep.What else is there to try to sleep? Ambien would give me the same side effects as lunesta. Atarax didn't keep me asleep. Benzos aren't an option because I get ketamine infusions and they make ketamine ineffective. My remeron dose is too high to put me to sleep because I use it for the antidepressant qualities.Has anyone else ever had ambien or lunesta make them depressed? How rare is it? 27/f/bipolar if it matters.
Signal	Hello, I have struggled with insomnia for 7 years. My main struggle is waking up too early and falling back asleep. I usually need to use the bathroom when I wake up. I have tried to drink less fluids before bed, but I have to take medication an hour before bed so I have to drink a bit of water. I also think anxiety might be a factor in my insomnia. I need a solid 8-9 hours of sleep to feel well rested but lately, I’ve been getting only 6-7. Even when I get 8 hours of sleep, I often don’t feel well rested. What has helped you? Thank you.
NotSignal	so after finally being able to sleep again(after 5 months) i have rly big problems with my circulation(specially in the morning and when i get tired), will this ever go away again? i still feel weakened from the sleep deprivation but finally being able to sleep again is a blessing..
NotSignal	I haven’t stocked up enough pills. My supply is very limited this quarantining will mess me up, What do you recommend ? how did you fall asleep without drugs after gaining dependency?
NotSignal	I tried Belsomra, but am plagued by next day grogginess ALL day long. I’ve heard Sonata has a very short half-life! If you took/take Sonata, did you have problems with weight gain or grogginess?
NotSignal	I have suffered from insomnia since high school, recently I was diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed stimulants. Shockingly they didn't worsen my already hit or miss sleeping abilities, but my health started to decline rapidly a few months later. When the quarantine hit I was switched to working from home. It was around this time sleep became almost entirely impossible. It felt like my brain was short circuiting.My doc prescribed me muscle relaxers for my other health conditions and even those would only work if I was a day or two sans sleep.After going to about 100 different doctors, one finally decided to test my vitamin d on a whim. It was in a SEVERE deficiency. Now the odd thing about this was.... I take a vitamin D supplement. And it wasn't working apparently. Cue some Google Fu and I found that to use vitamin d your body binds it to magnesium. Stimulants like caffeine, adhd meds can actually deplete this stuff pretty rapidly since they make you pee.So I started taking magnesium along side the vitamin d and the diffence was immediate. That same night I fell asleep blissfully at midnight. Every night since has been the same. I can't express how happy I am I found something relatively inert and OTC that lets me sleep like a normal person. .Get your D levels checked, my sleepless peeps, it could change your life!!
Signal	Plz tell me how bad ur insomnia has got before as I had my first ever bout 2 months ago and it has been RELENTLESS and still going on - no sleep last night for example. 3/4 completely sleepless nights a week & cannot nap during the day... losing the will 😊
NotSignal	My insomia was caused by many years of neglect and never having a real home and screwing my self over in relationships and being dumped and generally broken from lots of things in my life. Recently its been a break up I’ve been going through. I can’t sleep because all i think of is her, and the way things used to be. Ive been awake for almost 18 hours now and its 4:36 in the morning. All I’ve been thinking about since we split is her. I still love her but she doesn’t love me. I don’t know what to do.. im unbelievably lost.
Signal	I suffer from insomnia on an infrequent basis. It used to be much worse and it has got better but tonight is one of those nights. It started off with anxiety and now it’s almost 4:30 am and I still can’t sleep. I work 12 1/2 shifts and working with no sleep will be hell for me. I’m supposed to be heading to work in 2 hours. I just don’t know what to say to my employer. Pre-Covid I would just say I’m sick and leave it at that, but now my employer wants to know symptoms to screen for Covid. What should I say? Is insomnia a valid stand-alone reason for calling in sick?
NotSignal	I sometimes will wake up extra early and can't fall asleep again before getting up for work. Example: This morning I woke up at 3:30AM for the day when I usually wake at 4:50AM for the day. My question is, on days like this should i go to bed early or just go to bed at my usual time?
Signal	I usually wake up spontaneously between 4-5 am (after about 5 hours of sleep) and can't get back to sleep. This is so annoying. I don't really know what to do about it. My mind just starts wandering (without feeling nervous or anxious) and this way i can stay in bed for 1-2 hours without falling asleep. Any ideas?
Signal	I take them occasionally. I took 1mg 2 nights ago and had another weird dream I don't want to talk about. But I took 1mg an hour ago since I need to be asleep a few hours earlier than normal and right after I took it I rememered the dream side effect and now I'm anxious to fall asleep but I feel so sleepy...Anyone have some input lol
NotSignal	Lying here trying to sleep. Have to be up early since I have to take my husband to work at 7:20. Can’t come back and nap because I have errands that need to get done first thing in the morning. Sitting here with my eyes closed and hoping I at least go into my trance mode. Can’t move but fully aware of what’s going on. Seems like it’s a hot shower and OTC sleep aid kind of night. If I’m tired enough sometimes a hot shower helps me relax enough to sleep. I usually take it around 2am though.
NotSignal	Hi guys, I work in a hotel, and because it’s open to key workers I am still working. I got asked to do night shifts to cover, I said yes. It was all fine. I was sleeping probably 5 hours a day.I would have some sleepless nights before the night shifts but not this bad.Before the night shifts I had a sleeping pattern ish as I was on shifts either 6:00-3 or 3-11. After this I stopped the night shifts as I wasn’t sleeping much. Every since then I have sleepless nights, I can go until 4/5 then going to slee waking up at 11 ish. I am wondering if anyone has any other experiences?I am currently up 12:04, and have to be up at 5:30 to get ready for work.I would appreciate anyone’s help.Happy sleeping all
NotSignal	I have this huge task list that I started after the lockdown. The problem is that the list does not seem to be getting any shorter and the lockdown is over. One task is done another arises. These are tasks that I could not do for 2 years now because I spend 14 hours in worj and commute 5 days a week. I cant sleep because the list is not getting much shorter and lockdown is about to open here in Bangladesh. What do I do?
Signal	I was extremely anxious a month ago and had troubles falling asleep or staying asleep more than 4-5 hours.A typical night would be like 1am to 5am, then back to sleep around 8am to 11am. Or afternoon nap. Or just nothing at all. The problems that gave me anxiety are resolved, I have so much to look forward to but I still can't sleep. My alarm will go off in 2h and I have an 8h day ahead of me at work.I've always been through times that I had similar issues but they never lasted more than a couple of weeks. I keep active during the day but I'm mostly indoors. My bedroom is a bit too hot but we can't really change that. I air the room before going to bed. Sometimes I'm able to fall asleep on the couch which is far less comfortable. My husband tosses and turns, sometimes comes to bed in odd hours which wakes me up, his breathing is so loud but it's not a snore. I have those leg twitches and recently some nights where I feel awake but am actually asleep. I got CBD pills but they didn't help the slightest. There were 1-2 days that I managed to sleep uninterrupted 8h. I just wanna be able to sleep.
Signal	I've been dealing with chronic insomnia for 9 months. Before insomnia if I slept less than 8 hours I couldn't function. This past week has been 7 days no sleep, the longest I have ever gone. It started with environmental issues. I am sensitive to noise most likely due to childhood trauma and/or a fatal car accident as a teen. I plan on moving from a major city soon, but cannot make plans without cognitive skillsMy brain refuses to shut down. Xanax stopped working, also tried a few other sedatives. Tried weed in different forms and CBD. I have tried fasting, multiple times, tried not eating or drinking too close to bedtime. Today I took Benadryl and I am drinking wine ( I don't usually drink) to sleep during the day. Not working. Any suggestions?For context i am plant based, fast and exercise daily. Don't normally drink alcohol but do drink tons of water ad juice. Love being in outdoors etc. Youngish age...
Signal	I've always struggled to sleep normally for ages,tired sleeping tablets, prescribed shit. Nothing really gives me the actual essence of sleep. So I just got used to what I could get. But ever since I started my new bar job and simultaneously starting to live on my own. My sleep has gotten gradually worse. I came to a fairly obvious conclusion that stress must be linked to it somehow. But I never feel 'stressed'. I know every guy in the world says this but I'm so laid back and indifferent to most situations. I work hard, I earn a humble amount to pay rent and live off. I find my work fun, gives me purpose, keeps me active and on my feet. However I would be lying if I said there wasnt some stressful points like nearly getting fired the other week and when it gets hectic and theres not alot of staff. I can manage it though.However I feel like I've somehow hidden or pushed down the stress I'm feeling, and it affects my subconscious. And subconsciously I'm getting less sleep cause my brain is thinking about stuff? Hence making me sleeping less and more irregularly. Cause as I mentioned there has been some stressful moments but I dont feel it affect me directly after the period has already ended. I don't really know. I'd love to hear what you guys think about this and why it's happening now.
NotSignal	I've had maybe 1 hour of sleep the last 4 nights, what do I do? I feel wide awake and have no drive to sleep whatsoever. I'm thinking there's something seriously wronf and I'm scared. Melatonin, valerian, magnesium, tryptophan... Nothing works.
NotSignal	That would be nice. Unfortunately even 1 day with zero sleep is hard on me.
Signal	Haven’t slept for 35 hours and I am so irritable and emotional. Whenever I try to close my eyes, my mind just races about things stressing me out. My eyes are burning and I have a really bad headache from the lack of sleep, please help
NotSignal	And i am wired. Not even a bit tired. Sooooo gimme something to do cuz my new day shall start now!
Signal	A bad trip on weed a year or so ago brought out some very weird phobia and health anxiety fears in me, and it seems a lot harder to control the thoughts and I'm more susceptible to them. One of the fears in the past was around sleep and fear of not sleeping but also fear of going to sleep. It was endless months of terror and torture as going to bed made me even more fearful, and sometimes I would be up all night with my heart pounding. I was barely sleeping for months on end, and only getting a few hours a night. I slowly overcame this fear and anxiety but a couple weeks ago relapsed and went into another bout of terrible anxiety and insomnia. I have since recovered again but last night was another rough night, and now I notice my mind thinking about having to sleep tonight and it's not exactly a comforting feeling, almost like a dread feeling about falling asleep and not getting sleep. It's a thought in the back of my mind weighing me down and I'm sick of this stupid shit. I used to never once question sleep and would always fall asleep within 15-30 minuets. The issue is that the feeling alone can be enough to keep me awake at night even if I'm not giving it much thought, I just want my life back before this stupid thc messed me up.
NotSignal	The last few weeks have been stressful as hell. My grandpa has Parkinson and it's getting worse and worse, and he is always awake but somehow full of energy. The fact that he is always awake (sleeping maybe 3/4h a day maximum when he would sleep 10h before) is making me extremely anxious, because I'm an insomniac but also an anxious person. It just made me think about genetic problems, I don't even know. With all this situation my sleep deteriorated even more, to the point that today I slept 2h and every time I think about sleeping my belly just hurts and I just feel in a roller coaster. I'm scared of sleeping, I'm scared of not being able to sleep anymore, and I have so much stuff to do and this is just messing up with my head. I really don't know what to do to feel better, but I think I really needed to vent.
Signal	I’m a 16 yo male, and for the past month or so I have had an awful time getting to sleep. Typically with my school schedule I’m able to fall asleep around 12-1 am and wake at 7. But I have had a lot of trouble sleeping in the past as well. Ever since the quarantine, it’s been worse than ever before. Some nights I don’t sleep at all. Some nights I can go to bed at 2 or 3 am and some nights it’s 6 or 7 am. Right now it’s 6:20am. I was told to reset my sleep schedule by staying up all night, and I tried it twice. Didn’t really work either times. I accidentally napped both times during the day and I think it ruined it. I don’t know what to do. It’s so incredibly frustrating. I workout almost daily, high impact too and I’m still not tired at night. I play video games frequently into the night but lately I’ve been getting off super early, (10:30pm) like tonight and it’s had absolutely no effect on my sleeping. I drink coffee around 1-4pm whenever I wake up. Please help. I’m so desperate to have a good nights rest and be able to wake up at a reasonable time, preferably noon or a little earlier.
NotSignal	Counterintuitively, what if the cure is to drink like 1 litter of caffeine and wait for 2 days, then everything comes back to normal. Just what if.Been thinking about that. What if I know its dumb. But what if.
NotSignal	I was a normal sleeper with rare bouts of insomnia until about two years ago. Now it's constant. I'm just curious to know how long anyone else has gone without a respite?Side note: every time I read about people being cured from insomnia through something like CBTI, they've one l only dealt with it for a few months, and I just wonder if the success rate for that treatment is directly tied to how soon they start it after developing insomnia.
NotSignal	I started to fall asleep around 8pm yesterday evening which rarely ever happens so I decided to go to bed, I then fell asleep an hour later and now I'm still awake after waking up at 12am. I don't know why but my insomnia always get much worse during the winter months to the point where I sometimes wake up just as my family are about to go to bed. It's been like this for as long as I can recall.
NotSignal	Have you ever stayed awake for a week just to see some hallucinations?Me too.
NotSignal	Thu, 02/20/20...3:36 A.M. It's been about twenty hours since I was last asleep and honestly I feel fantastic right now. I'm learning faster than ever before, I'm accomplishing so much I need to have accomplished before the end of the month, I'm also trying my hand at the dating game again. I have felt sort of out of the loop since my last real relationship as things got out of hand fairly quickly and for a long time. It got to be tio much to bear. However, as of recently I'm finding myself semi-seemingly attracted. Especially because the person I've been talking to on a regular basis now started merely as an acquaintance, and move 1uite substantially to the level it's at right now where in my eyes, we are totally neglectful of the fact we are human and not mechanical entities driven by our insatiable hunger for more of eachothers time, compassion, and seemingly elevated animal instincts. When I looked into this person's eyes, I felt different some how. I've had "semi intimate relationships" with some people in the pass. However this time felt COMPLETELY different... Ive felt people rip my beating heart out of my chest, wipe their feet on it, and kick it to the curb when they're done being entertained by it anymore. Then again this was incredibly polar to this event. This time... it felt as though when I looked in her eyes, talked to her, and listened to what she said... it was at that moment my defenses went offline, my guard was down completely, and my mind became hollow, not a solitary thought running through my mind let alone thousands of thoughts happening roughly about the same time throughout my remainder of the day. What I really want to write about is how she makes me feel. I've had drugs that had less of an impact then what I'm feeling right now. I've read that oxy-tocin is released when you hug other individuals, but since she hugged me today I feel like my receptors could be flooded with it and theres nothing I can do but have my heart broken yet again to dispell the curse she could have hexed me with. At this point I dont really care about physical, sexual, or even verbal intimacy with her as of yet, however, what I want to do is just learn more about this individual. I've been waiting a while for red flags and none yet but I will stay vigilant. As far as this dating thing goes... I'm going to go as far as I can with this one... I think she may just be what I've been preparing for to this point. The catch is I'm really bad with relationships. So I need help not messing it up. I know I may sound over obsessive and controlling to an extent but honestly I expected a friend, and ended up with a beautiful person. Make fun of me if you want but for the most part I'm really glad I'm writing again. Especially about something I'm interested in. In something I can learn more about. In addition to these it's someone who is interested in me... The way I understand it our stores have finally crossed platforms and its time to ride this wave. So wish me luck. Give me your best advice to not fuck this up, and let me know what I can and cant do. Even If it has to do wit my writing. For now I'm too baked so I'm signing off. Good night reddit!-reddituser840
NotSignal	Idk what to do.I had a headache late last night and I just felt so exhausted around 2:00 am and ever since then I’ve been trying to fall asleep and it’s now 12:30 pm.Meditation, music, shot of liquor, tv, scrolling through social media, laying still. I just CAN’T and I’m sooooo tiredI don’t have melatonin and I can’t get any any time soonIt’s also so hot outside. Yesterday I had the best sleep I’ve had in ages but today I just can’t Any other tips or tricks?
NotSignal	Haven’t slept yet. If i go to bed now i won’t wake up til like 4-5. I do this way too often, thinking it’s another stay up all day kinda day boys
NotSignal	I sleep on my back. My stomach is facing up. I think my body is straight when I fall asleep. Whenever I wake up, my body is tilted. As in when I look at my toes, it’s not straight with my spine. My spine is misaligned. My stomach is to the left of my torso. I’m still on my back and my stomach is still facing up.Every time I try to align myself properly so my spine is straight, I always wake up misaligned and crooked. Then I have back pains when I try to get out of bed. Is there anyway to fix it?
NotSignal	My boyfriend has been knocked out for the past couple of hours and as I’m trying to sleep (knowing I probably won’t) and I just watch him and wonder how good it must feel. We both work in a few hours but one of us will at least be rested. Personal question: do you feel happy they are peacefully sleeping or are you jealous of them. I’m a little bit of both but I’m happy someone can enjoy a full night rest.
Signal	My worst fear is happening right now, so far so good but Idk what its going to be like tomorrow morning😭😭 aaaahhh I just want to sleep😭😭——————————————————————
NotSignal	**So the times this happens when I have been sleep deprived for a day, and I am super tired and I try to sleep that "brink of sleep feeling" closely associated with insomnia.*****a twighlight of the brink of sleep, when I am sleep deprived, tired and TRY to go to sleep.***It "triggers"basically, it feels like a Dark mass is ballooning off my head, I suddenly feel panicked, scared, fight or flight triggers, I break into a sweat. I feel like a massive weight is not crushing but "ballooning" off my body, a massive, black mass. This is a feeling, I don't see anything literally.there is a "pressure" on the roof of my mouth, my forehead, a feeling of coldness, it feels like the insthe more I try to "comprehend" the black mass, the more in triggers insane, Horrific feelings of pure dread.I feel like I'm going insane and loosing my mind,I don't find it hard to breatheand it is pure, existential absolute TERROR, I jump out of bed, turn the lights on, and it still persists, it can happen at high noon when I was sick and woke up after sleeping for 12ish hours.Another big thing that pops up is massive numbers I deal with massive numbers normally, with no issue million, billion, trillions, but during this phase these values become associated with the black mass, they become terrifying, incomprehensibleI was pacing around in one of these states in broad daylight, I picked up a piece of paper and threw it in the trash, that for some reason took on the "small value" and I imagined comparing the action, magnifying it, repeating it a billion times and further sent me into the panic death spiral.it's not sleepy paralysis, I can fully control my movements sight, everythingafter 20 or so minutes, probably after playing some loud gaming youtube video, it wearsXXXXXXXit is IMMEDIATELY recognizable, it is the same feeling I have had for YEARS, but it is very infrequentXXXXXXX**My question is:****Is this just my own brand of panic attack, or does this feeling refer to anything specific related to sleep deprivation-related panic attacks something related to sleep paralysis?**any relatable experiences?
Signal	Last Wednesday I lost my job due to layoffs. I was told it had nothing to do with my performance. But this -- combined with the recent death of my dog, my mom's somewhat recent diagnosis of aggressive brain cancer, and chronic pain stemming from some disphit teenager hitting me with his car while I was training for a race -- was the straw that broke the camel's back. I can't sleep and I can't focus. I've been prescribed Klonopin, take Tylenol PM or NyQuil every night, and sometimes smoke pot -- but still haven't gotten more than 2-3 hours of sleep over the past five days. My partner said I woke up more than ten times on Saturday, twice screaming. What do I do?
Signal	I'm breaking the pills and splitting the powder so that i'm only taking about 5 mg. I'm curious if the side effects wane over time like most drugs on the initial ramp-up. If I wake up at 8 AM I seem to be groggy until around noon which probably won't work for me once I go back to work. I have to be able to function. If not, perhaps it would be better to take earlier before bed time, like say 8 PM if sleep starts at midnight. Maybe I won't be as sleepy after I wake up that way. Any ideas?
NotSignal	For the last year or so I've had trouble falling asleep but in the last month or two it's gotten rediculous. Every night I'm up till 5am, laying in bed with no phone or anything for several hours straight and I'm pretty certain it's insomnia.Any suggestions for what I should do?Onky thoughts I've had so far is to ask if I can see a doctor of some sort or get some sort of sleeping medication from the pharmacy. (I'm a teenager so ofc ill have to get my parents to do most of it) any other ideas?
Signal	It’s an antidepressant that’s also used for insomnia and chronic headaches.I was recently prescribed this by my neurologist. Anyone try it before?
NotSignal	Hello everyone,I have been having some interesting issues. I keep on waking up in the middle of the night like 5-6 hours of sleep which could be maintenance insomnia. But, during these times I always feel the urge to pee for some reason which I never had before. Btw this urge isnt really strong, its just a mild/uncomfortable sensation and tbh when I go to pee, there isn't even that big of a volume of urine. Could it be some kind of bladder problem that's actually making me wake up in the night and not my insomnia/anxiety? or is my mind just making a big fuss about me wanting to pee since its never a full bladder? I researched into it and found people with sleep apnea actually wake up to pee in the night as well.Any thoughts?
NotSignal	Hey guys,I've been having problems with getting up multiple times at night, atleast 2-3 times and sometimes up to 8 times. Mostly triggered by having to pee, even though my bladder is not nearly full. I've googled the symptoms and I think I might have a "condition" called nocturia.Have anyone had experiences with possible solutions for this ?
NotSignal	ever since i was little i would fall asleep really late at like sunrise but i'm not really annoyed with it. there's been times where i'll get 1-3 hours of sleep everyday for a week but it doesn't really affect me or at least i don't think it does. i'm not exhausted throughout the day and i do go on my phone and stuff at night but it's because i know that even if i do just lay there for hours for without sleeping. i have tried some things to help but they don't really work they might give me an extra hour every now and then. there has been a few times where it's made me feel pretty shitty but it's not like other people on here that seem to suffer from it every night.
NotSignal	Hi all. I've always been a good sleeper. I could instantly hit the pillow and float away to dreamland. Highschool is where my sleep problems started. I was on my school's swim team and before every practice I would fight the urge to sleep (as I was accustomed to sleeping after school). I then had hard times sleeping at night . I am now in college and these sleep problems still plague me. I'll go months with great sleep but then, as if the devil flipped my switch, I'll have months of shit sleep. Do you think shocking my body out of sleep like that caused these sleep problems? I've been awake for about 4 days now. And let me clarify, when I say I didn't sleep, I don't mean I got 5 hours, 3 hours, or even 1 hour. I mean it literally - I didn't sleep at all.TLDR: Can fighting sleep before intense physical activity cause permanent sleep problems?
Signal	For what it's worth, I am 33, non-smoker/ light drinker, medium /athletic built and not on any medication.&#x200B;I've been WFH since COVID began and while at first it seemed like a paid vacation, I believe it is responsible for all or most of my insomnia. My schedule prior to this was:wake up at 530am, work from the office from 7am to 330pm, get back home around 430pm, power nap at 5pm for 20 or so minutes and relax all evening, before hitting the sack at 11pm.While I only got 6.5hrs during the night, I made up for it with my power nap which tops me up, and gives me energy for the evening's tasks. This has been my schedule for the better part of three years. While I did experience the odd bout of insomnia here and there, it has never been this bad, or this long lasting. However, with WFH, I've been unable to fall asleep until 3 to 4am- or this morning, 5am. My ability to nap and catch up on sleep has also completely deteriorated, and I have not had a single nap in the past two or so months. Including times in which I forced myself to nap in a blacked out room for over 4 hours to no avail.This has of course caused me further stress and anxiety, especially as I started working out 4x a week, coincidentally around the same time this all began, and I fear that I won't have energy the next day for an enjoyable workout. And if I were to force myself to work out on 4 to 5 hours of sleep, it seems to just exacerbate my insomnia as I am now too tired to fall asleep. **My insomnia comes in the following form:**My go-to way of falling asleep has been "talking to myself" with my inner voice or coming up with a fantasy scenario. With this tactic, I can almost immediately feel myself start dozing off, as my head starts to feel heavy and breathing slows down. As my eyes and my mind relax, I begin to enter a half asleep state, where I have a sort of pseudo dream- a completely random scene that plays out. Then without fail, just as I begin this pseudo dream, I am aroused awake and start from the beginning all over again. Often times, when I enter this dream state, I will get a hypnic jerk or wake myself up with a loud snort or a startled breath.Then by some miracle when I do fall asleep, I usually end up waking up several times a night in short bursts. Often times, I am able to doze back out, but sometimes, it will take me an hour or so, or even cause me to get up, completely. This is excruciating. I can lie there for hours ( last night it was 6 hours) going in and out of this dream state. It is as if there is some force preventing me from just dozing off, against all the wishes of my tired mind. I wish there was a way to resolve this, but nothing short of 15mg Temazepam is helping- and even then, it doesn't always work. Does anyone else get the same symptoms of insomnia? And is there anything I can do to prevent it? I am seeing a GP next week, but any help is appreciated. So far I have :Practiced turning off electronics 30 mins before bed (shifting further out to an hour)Not eating 3 hours before bedChatting with my wife/ letting my mind relaxAttempted to clear my mind and not play out my usual fantasy scenariosUsed ear plugs and eye coverAll of which to no avail.Any help is appreciated.
Signal	My insomnia is so bad It takes 4 or 5 hour to fall a sleep and when I sleep it feels like I don’t reach a deep sleep. And when I fall sleep I sleep for short duration 1 -2 hours. I have had insomnia for 5 months. I am panicking because I think it’s SFI. I feel so tired and sleepy the entire day but I can’t sleep. I don’t know what to do my parents think is not worth bringing me to the doctor I need help someone pls help calm down I feel so broken down.
Signal	I’m 17 as of now and I’ve had sleep troubles since I was 10 probably even longer but I can’t remeber ive tried mirtazapine,clonodine,trazadone I’m even taking Prozac to see if it can get my sleep on schedule I’ve been on it regularly or about three months and still nothing. I’m getting to the point where I can’t take it anymore I’m short tempered with my fiancé my parents and my siblings it’s making me not want to go into work cause I’ll need be scheduled for 9:30am and be awake till 9:00am this isn’t a way of life lmao. I just need advice my doctors won’t prescribe me anything like lunesta or zolpidem or zopiclone I’ve heard they do miracles for even if it’s just for a short while I can’t sleep ever and it’s taking my life away from me please any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you so much for taking the time to read and my bad about the grammar.
Signal	I got insomnia 4-5 days ago. This is vert stressful period due to me having chronic hives and throat tightness.When I go to sleep I empty my mind and think of nothing literally. I still can't sleep. Sleep hygiene is pure joke and it doesn't work for me (I go to bed at the same time but it doesn't metter). Melatonin worked once but it stopped working. Valerian root is a pure joke, and only thing that works is Bromazepam. Would CBTI work for me since I don't think negatively when I go to bed but I still can't sleep.
NotSignal	I was finally able to fix my sleep schedule after going nearly 48hrs sleepless the other week. That experience was so terrifying it motivated me to do ANYTHING in my power in order to fix my sleep schedule. Currently going to sleep around 23/00 and waking up around 4/5 in the morning. 5 hours are perfect to me, I feel great and have never really slept more than that all my life (I'm 26). All I did was turning lights off after 9am, avoid using smartphone/computer and that's about it.Wish you all good luck.
Signal	Last night I laid down at 1030pm. Checked my phone, was 1am. Great. Stayed laying down. Checked phone, 3am. Great.After that I started focusing on just counting my breathing and nothing else, and things started to get a little freakyI got this tingling sensation all over my body and felt as though my whole body was shut down and all I could control was my breathing. My eyes were making rapid movements under my eyelids and I was getting things I could only describe akin to close eyes visuals. This went in for about 10min until I opened my eyes because I was starting to get freaked out by the REM.Was I asleep and awake at the same time? Is that lucid dreaming?
NotSignal	I have only been getting 5 or less hours of sleep a night I fell in a fog all day how long can a gunman live like this di people really do this for months
Signal	It doesn’t matter how much sleep I get. I started to struggle with depression for about 2 years now and insomnia comes and goes but even when I’m not dealing with it I’m also so tired now I could sleep 2 hours, 8 hours, or even 12 hours and I’m still just as tired as before.
NotSignal	My entire body aches after not sleeping>24-48H, but it’s particularly severe in my neck, upper back, and shoulders. When I ask non-insomniac friends (in their 20s-30s) how they feel after a (real) all-nighter, they usually say tired but most don’t complain of physical pain. I don’t have any neck or shoulder pain at all when I’m not sleep-deprived, and never “wake up” with the pain. This is probably one of the most intolerable parts of insomnia stretches for me, this and being a non-functional zombie in general. Anyone else have a particular troublesome area when sleep deprived?
NotSignal	I usually get anywhere between 4-3 hours of sleep every night. After I wake up I feel dizzy until I take an afternoon nap. It's probably me being sleep deprived, but I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this.
Signal	I’ve had bouts of insomnia throughout my life. Fortunately, it was also at random and never lasted very long.About a year ago, which was midway through graduate school, I started to have more frequent episodes. There were random days where I either couldn’t fall asleep or I’d wake up super early. Still not super alarmed because I figured it was stressed related to balancing school and work. Sometimes it would be a few months before it returned.Flash forward to two weeks ago. I went up to NYC to see some friends. I’ll admit, I drink pretty heavily and stayed out to 2 a.m. on Friday, and 1 a.m. on Saturday. The following week was pretty awful. I wasn’t able to fall asleep until 2 or 3 am despite always being able to fall asleep around 8/9. The weird part of it was that in the past when I didn’t sleep much, I’d feel super tired throughout the next subsequent days. Now, I’m tired but by no means sleepy.Not sure what's going on with me. It's been over a week at this point, and there has only been one day where I've gotten a decent amount of sleep. I'm getting nervous because this seems to be my new reality. Any tips or advice on what I should do? Melatonin used to work pretty well for me at a low dosage, but now even at a higher amount, it doesn't seem to be doing much. I've already been in touch with my primary care physician, who thinks it's anxiety-related, so I'm back on anti-anxiety medications that I've been off of for a little over a year.
NotSignal	As the title suggest I'm merely looking for some preventive measures to put forth. I'm a youngin' and as I age school becomes harder and harder, keeping social relations is increasingly burdensome and just being kind becomes a hassle. I've been an insomniac for as long as I can remember, I go days without sleeping and the days I do rest I wake up as drowsy as if I haven't slept at all. I'm a tad bit afraid of what my future holds, I already fail to maintain cohesive memories and all that occupies the predominantly blank space in my mind is the longing of rest. I'm sure this isn't foreign news to alot of you, but I would like to know what helped you all pursue careers and maintain at least a semi healthy lifestyle when the act of sleeping holds you back?
Signal	I just want to share my sleeping troubles. I've had a hard time sleeping because even though I feel awfully tired and sleepy, my brain would always trick me into not falling a sleep, if that even makes sense. I know it sounds silly but, I've had this problem since I was a kid, I couldn't sleep because whenever I'm about to my brain always sleep-block me, and then I wont feel as much as sleepy for a few minutes or so. Then the moment I do feel sleepy again, my brain does it again and the whole cycle repeats itself until the next morning where I either fall asleep eventually but just for a few hours or never at all. It's super frustrating! I tried having some sleeping pills, working out but it just makes things worse because i feel like it doesnt matter how tired I am I just could sleep. I swear like my own brain is trolling me. The most I had without sleep due to this is 2 days. I dont know what's wrong with my head but I really need help how to stop or counter attack this so to speak. I'm almost in my second day of no sleep again and I reaallly just wanna have a good nights rest.
NotSignal	I didn't sleep for the past week (I normally always fall asleep in an instant) for no reason whatsoever. I'm really sensitive to no sleep so just 1 Night without it makes me go absolutely crazy. Now for some reason 1 night without sleep got to 1 week with barely any sleep. I do literally everything to sleep better. I exercise, I use my bed only for sleep, I only read a book 1 hour before sleep, my whole room is extremely dark, I use magnesium 1 hour before sleep.I literally can't stop thinking about how I'm not able to sleep the entire fucking Day and Night. I feel like I'm losing my Mind, I'm extremely dissociated. I tried to ignore these constant thoughts about sleep yesterday, but still the same. I just lay there for hours and literally nothing happens, even when I don't try to stress myself out. The worst fucking thing is even if I fall asleep, I wake up at the exact same timing about 4 hours after sleep and can't get back to sleep after that no matter what. I can't live with this for any longer I'm afraid this will become chronic. Idk what to do, I don't wanna be dependent on medications. If this goes any longer I'm seriously considering suicide
NotSignal	This type of sleep problem was gone for more than 6 months and this was the primary problem with sleep for me. Suddenly everything is not good, I have to move in bed, earbuds make me hear my heartbeat which interrupts me falling asleep, then my video Im playing suddenly has loud ads, making me snap out of trying to sleep and now its 4:20 am having extreme anxiety whenever I close my eyes. I felt a strong sleep pressure just now which usually knocks me out, but now my anxiety just got stronger and now the sleepiness is gone.it doesnt help that as always, after some days of break they started doing some construction work ofc for like the 20th time in the last months so im anxious if I cant fall asleep until like 7am then I will be interrupted by drilling and construction sounds again.
NotSignal	So. I don’t have trouble falling asleep. I sleep by around 11:30 everyday. But. I wake up by 4:30 everyday. It’s like clockwork. And then I try to sleep and fall asleep in like 20 minutes or less and have vivid dreams. When I wake up by 4:30 I am clear headed. But when I wake up after the 2 hour sleep after 4:30 I don’t feel very clear headed. Is it normal ? The 4:30 waking could be from the sound of my roommate waking up and getting ready for work tho
Signal	It's 3.37am where I am. I can't sleep and I have to wake up at 8am for a 9.30am class later. I'm afraid that if I sleep I'll oversleep and miss class. I'm also in some pain. I don't know what to do. Painkillers don't seem to help. I've tried not napping too but it's not very effective
Signal	I've had insomnia for years. I can't sleep for 24-30 hours at a go. As a result, I might end up sleeping at 5-6 AM and I struggle to sleep for more than a couple of hours at a go, and end up feeling tired during the day. I've tried melatonin etc, the whole 9 yards in addition to my antidepressants. Things work for a short while and then stop.I moved back with my family last month after I got laid off. They think me sleeping at such odd hours is just me being lazy and I'm just wasting my time away. I do my chores a little later than the rest but I do it. I conduct my job hunt in the second half of the day but I do it. They think it's a lifestyle decision I'm *choosing* to make. It's not. I would do anything right now to be able to sleep from 12-6 AM like a "normal" human being (their words). How do I explain to them that I do not choose to have insomnia?
Signal	Argh, I’m too tired to rant but know that the intense irritation, hate and wrath is all present for stupid basic shit written about insomnia from non insomniacs. Like, it’s crap that only works for the normal person that doesn’t have chronic insomnia. Does anyone else get irate when the come across stupid insomnia self help articles on “sleep hygiene”? I’ve tried all the tricks and they do NOTHING for me and I’ve had insomnia since childhood.
NotSignal	While I’m aware that neither are ideal, I’m wondering which is safer for ongoing use? After trying what seems like everything, these are the only two things that work. I’m terrified of tolerance/withdrawal issues so wondering which is less likely to cause me issues in the longer term?
NotSignal	I recently made a big change to my sleep schedule, and as a result I have been experiencing trouble falling asleep aswell as this: As of recent, every couple days I will fall asleep at around 3 AM and then "awake" at about 5 AM but I can't remember if I had slept at all or if I just laid down with my eyes closed for two hours, I eventually fall back asleep and wake up again a few hours later with the same confusion. Eventually, I will remember getting SOME sleep throughout the night but I can't determine how much as I can't remember what was real sleep or not. This seems to fall in lines with "paradoxical insomnia", was curious if anyone else knew about this and potentially how to stop it? Thx!TL;DR: Been experiencing potential symptoms of paradoxical insomnia and am looking for ways to prevent it from happening anymore.
Signal	Sufferer of maintenance insomnia here. Went to bed at 1:30am, woke up at around 4. Took an Ambien but given it’s 6 am now, I can just assume it didn’t work. These types of morning, where I see the sun rise, are really hard for me. Just seeing that morning light makes me feel deep despair. I’m currently hiding out in the darkest room in the house just to avoid any hint of sunlight...It’s frustrating, dealing with this insomnia for almost 3 years. My attempts at following CBT-I always end in failure because I just can’t stay “sane” on a 4 hour sleep regimen for a month (and if you’re asking, the doctors gave me a longer sleep window than 4 hours, but no matter what, I always wake up after a few hours). The sad thing, for me, is that klonopin is the only medicine that gets rid of those mid-night awakenings, but it’s addictive, so I can’t take it all the time... i’m just intensely depressed right now. I’m going to have to get ready for work in an hour but I feel...well I feel like I want to die. I’m just here, writing, to pull myself together emotionally.
NotSignal	I have had insomnia for almost 3 years. This has never happened to me before. This past month i have been feeling dizzy and its becoming more noticeable each day. Is this normal? I feel like my senses are "foggy", like when you're a little bit drunk. (but i'm completely sober). I understand whats happening, i can still work, but i feel like fainting at times. Any input would be helpful. Thanks!
NotSignal	Fuck this life. My mother is fueling my anxiety even further by shouting for literally no reason at all, and she also refuses to take me to the doctor because apparently I am seeking for attention. I am so confused. My brain feels so fuzzy. I love my mother for giving me this beautiful existence. I feel so helpless. I have been crying all day. I wish I could just drop dead.
NotSignal	Sorry if this post is too much info but I’m not sure who to ask as my psychiatrist doesn’t know the answer so the best people to ask are anyone who went through or are going through it.. I’m asking anyone who is taking trazodone (I’m on 100mg a night) if they had experienced a lower libido from the medication, I’m also on Effexor XR but only 37.5 which is low so I don’t believe that is the problem but of course doesn’t help. I’ve read as much as I can off google and it just says that you could have prolonged erections at night but nothing about it effected your libido during the day.. Now every different SSRI I’ve taken had some negative side effect on libido for me, so has anyone else on any mg of trazodone experienced anything at all like this?? Any responses will help, thank you
Signal	Im so tired and WAS so sleepy. But i’m now afraid of sleeping and letting go. ._. its 3 am fml
NotSignal	Recently my sleep is awful, I fall asleep okay but I wake up so early ever morning at maybe 3 or 4 am and then I can’t get back to sleep. Is it better to just get up when you wake up? I try to sleep some more but it never works and it’s making me feel so low and drained. I feel like an absolute shell.
NotSignal	So my coworker comes into work half an hour late today.ME: how come your so late?HER: I had a horrible night's sleep and overslept.ME:How many hours did you get?HER: only 9 hours
Signal	Ive been taking triazolam for the past 4 days, 5 mg I think, and the aide effects are insane. The first night I took one I slept for 14 hours with some waking in between, but now I'm sort of back to struggling with sleeping. I've been experiencing insane drowsiness, constipation, and nausea today and I wanted to know if anyone can relate, even with such short usage, I also can't seem to take a nap despite trying like 3 times.I'm really worried that I'm just gonna keep getting worse and not be able to sleep and it feels like I'm going crazy, so I really need some reassurance
NotSignal	i don't know how i can define this. i can't sleep at nights no matter whatever the hell i do to get sleepy. (you know, the ASMR stuffs, sleep music and all) but just the time the sun starts to pop up, i tend to sleep as well (5AM or 6AM mostly) . and i generally cant wake up untill 12PM. and it gets even worse. I wake up, get freshen up, take some breakfast, the i feel sleepy again, and wake up at 4PM (afternoon) This has been happening for quite a long time now.I never wanted to grow this habit but it has eventually grown. what should i do now to build up a healthy sleep schedule?
Signal	40 mg of sonata 100 mg of hydroxcyzine And nothing. 🤔🤨😐😔😒😳😭😡🤬Why cant I just be normal and one pill would put me to sleep just fine. But here I am 7am no chance of sleep now.
Signal	I'm having severe insomnia for the last month and it has been pure suffering. I bought a self help book and took trazodone 50mg but only get max 3-4 hrs of sleep. My blood pressure is increasing, have chest pain, hallucinations, lost 20lbs, urinate 20 times a day and literally nobody gives a f*** my life is tearing apart. My only close relative living with me is my mom and she said "well you are the only one who can get you out of this" well fuck, I don't think that's possible. I'm angry at God for putting me in this situation. My mom said that as soon as I step on the hospital I'll get corona and "it will take me straight to the grave" which made me cry. I don't trust in psychologists since I'll meet with them just once a week just to tell me stuff that I already know. Why there isn't help for this? Insomnia is SO misunderstood. I feel trapped inside a maze and my days like a ticking time bomb before I get a stroke or something. I don't know what to do, seriously.
Signal	Last week I had a huge insomnia attack, but that was mainly due to me sleeping during the day and messing up my schedule completely. Afterwards I slept 8 hours a night for the past week. Just tonight I'm again sleepless, don't know if I will fall asleep, it's nearly 4:30 AM. I'm a musician and I got a gig during the daytime. Every other day however I was doing almost nothing.My automatic thoughts of sleep anxiety keep me up at night. My wake up point is set to 8 AM so that I could avoid messing up my sleep schedule. Not sure what I should do. This kinda sucks.
Signal	I haven’t had problems with insomnia since I was a kid, But a few months ago when I started a new anti depressant I started waking up at early hours and not being able to fall back asleep or not until hours of tossing and turning. When it started happening more frequently my psychiatrist prescribed me Hydroxyzine but it hasn’t really worked. For the past 5 or 6 days I have woken up anywhere from 2am-6am and not been able to fall asleep. It makes me so mad because I start school in a week and I haven’t been able to sleep in all summer. But during the school year I couldn’t even wake up on time for morning classes. Yesterday I started hallucinating kinda and hearing noises that aren’t there. I’ve been extremely jumpy and on edge and whenever I hear my mom knock on my door I scream and jump and shake. Everything is loud, I’m shaking so badly and feel dizzy. Last night I wanted to sleep so bad just to wake up at 2am again. I was so desperate I even tried to pray(not religious) and I begged god that if he was real he would let me sleep just one night. And he didn’t. When I woke up at 2am I prayed again, nothing. I can’t continue like this.
Signal	I fall asleep at 6am and wake up around 2pm. I hate it, i tried taking melatonin 4 hours ago it didn’t do anything. I was supposed to have a psychiatrist to talk about as I’ve had to be on trazadone before. But she cancelled it cause she couldn’t make it I’m so upset.
Signal	Hi guys, i have really severe chronic insomnia (3-4 days awake at a time for the past year) and have been through plenty of meds trying to treat it including trazodone, topamax, abilify, lunesta, ambien, diazepam, gabapentin, lyrica, doxepin, hydroxyzine, and probably more im forgetting. Currently taking seroquel 100-150 which gets me around 5 hours max and has worked better than anything else. I can only sleep for 3-4 hours at a time with it before i wake up and then pass back out for another hour or so. Ive read that orexin inhibitors help to prevent you from waking up like this. Does anyone have experience with that drug class? What are the side effects like and is there rebound insomnia or a withdrawal syndrome? It sounds like something id want to try but not if its at all similar to benzos cause those withdrawals completely ruined my life for a while
Signal	I’m up at 4am yet again after a very restless 4 hours of sleep. I was on Remeron (mirtazipine) for sleep and it was a freaking god send. 8 hours of sleep every night for 3 years. Almost forgot what my insomnia was like. I had to stop taking it due to weight gain and back problems. I need to lose weight. So now I am on trazodone. I also take Xanax every night to help with falling asleep. Well, the trazodone does absolutely nothing and the mirtazipine withdrawal was horrible. Will I ever sleep again?? Anyone on a sleep aid that worked for them? I have tried amitryptiline, ambien, sonata, tamezapam, unisom, valerian, melatonin to no avail. I have been through grueling CBT and have good sleep habits and limited caffeine intake.
NotSignal	Just bought one of these new-fangled weighted blankets I’d been hearing about in the hopes this might just be the magic bullet... nah, still awake as usual after laying in bed for two hours. Oh well, anyone have better results than me?
NotSignal	Dehydration helps me sleep?I've been drinking water every night before bed for the last year, and always had trouble sleeping less than even 12 hours. I'd wake up tired and unable to function if I got less than 9. This week I skipped my nightly water intake, and even though I slept less than 7 hours, I was not nearly as tired as I would be before, almost like in my high school days. Does HYDRATION reduce your sleep quality or necessitate a lot of rest? I don't wake up in the night to go to the bathroom, and I'm not dying to go when I wake up. I'm 20, skinny, and sleep on my back with no snoring.
Signal	Hey guys! So since the start of this pandemic my sleep hygiene and schedule went completely out the window. At first I thought I just wasn’t tired because of how little I was doing during quarantine. However after a month I wasn’t sleeping at all. I would toss and turn for hours and watch the sun come up everyday. I tried melatonin but it gave me awful lucid dreams. I tried CBD oil but I mistakenly got a sativa strain so I’m going to try something with CBN. After losing all hope I decided to call a doctor who prescribed me Zopiclone 7.5 and told me to take half. I honestly have noooooo idea if I slept. I do remember tossing and turning for a while... but anyways now I’m here 7:00 am and wide awake and feeling anxious as ever. I know anxiety is the reason for my insomnia right now and I have to fix that before my sleeping can change. Would you guys recommend still taking half the 7.5 tablet seeing as how I still had a fairly light sleep? Is it safe to take the full amount? Thanks:)
NotSignal	This is a revised and lengthened version of the book idea I got here. Its honestly been nice writing it when I cannot sleep. It kinda gives me something to look forward too in times like that. Probably will post when I can if mods will allow it. Hope whoever gives it a read enjoys Have you ever wondered what happens to a ghost town. The consensus is that it is what it is a abandoned town. A freeze frame of a time long gone, or a dream long dead. The town Luna Light is not exactly that. It is a sort of haven for those with the curse of sleeplessness. It is home for those who are lost. Whether it be in a literal, spiritual or metaphorical sense. One thing unites them all; it is the curse of sleeplessness. Luna Light's history is peculiar to say the least. It is almost like a folk tale passed down by those who know it. The town was founded around the 1820's. It was built in a somewhat unorthodox place. See Luna Light was in a isolated part of Oregon country. Some good distance from any ocean or major city, and the closest water source a days trek away. Many wonder why anyone would've started a town there.Not surprisingly the town eventually died off. With a mixture of abandonment, and lack of resources. Most of the township left, and the people that stayed shared the same fate. Eventually even in its dilapidated state the town became a haven.It was 1998, and counter culture was seeing a decline. Needing a new place to call home some flocked to Luna Light. With that few the town saw life again. Be it one made up disillusioned hippies,punks and the like. Even so it was what they called home.
NotSignal	Got my first day at my new job in 4 hours. Right as I laid down to bed my fucking dumb troll of a brain is like “hey wouldn’t it suck if you didn’t sleep at all tonight?” aaaanndd that’s exactly what happened. Today is gonna be fun...
NotSignal	I read an article stating that simply lying down and being still and quiet was still restful for your brain, obviously not as good as sleep but better than nothing. So I started finding comfort in the idea that I might be staring intently at the inside of my eyelids for hours but it was still a form of rest. Then when I doze off an hour before my alarm I didn't feel like I'd had a huge chuck of the night where I hadn't rested.Then I read another article saying that when you wake up in the night with the really specific 'totally awake' feeling you shouldn't lie in bed because otherwise your brain stops associating bed with sleep. So yesterday I got up, had a shower and did the washing up when suddenly I felt tired again and was able to get back into bed and fall straight to sleep and woke up at about 10am when my husband got up.Both ideas seen plausible. Getting up seems the more productive thing but my bed is especially warm and cosy at 3:30am! I know my specific issue of falling asleep easily at bedtime then being wide awake a few hours later is really common and I was wondering if anyone else gets up and does stuff during that time. If you do, what do you get up to? I've done 3am baking before much to my husband's bemusement! I'm very tempted to play more Animal Crossing when I inevitably wake up tonight but I do try to avoid screens even if I get up to do things. Might make an exception though...
NotSignal	I can't remember what it's like to have a clear head. I think I used to be smart. I think it's been over a year but as my memory breaks down so does the concept of time and I just live in an endless hopeless present, always trying some new technique or drug or concept that'll make me feel slightly drowsier as I lay awake for one more night. Always trying to get through the day so that I can get through the night so that maybe someday I can be a person instead of a fucking vegetable, so that I can get back to all those aspirations I used to have all those months ago.And it's getting to a point where I don't want to talk to anyone because I don't want anyone to see what a mess I'm turning into, slurring my words, staring into space, every thought blanked out and forgotten at about the same time as I realize it might be useful. Am I still myself or am I just some remnant waiting to realize that the person I used to be is dead?
Signal	My insomnia was at its absolute worst for 3-4 months, and it got under control for about 3ish weeks due to a medication I couldn't continue to take due to severe side effects.. And now I can feel myself slipping back into severe insomnia, its been about 3 days at this point with no more than maybe a combined total hour of sleep and I'm fucking feeling it, and I'm goddamn terrified. Idk where I'm going with this, I just feel myself slipping, and I'm truly hoping this new medication might help me sleep without ruining my mental health.
Signal	Okay so went to the doctor's today to address my bad insomnia lately and they prescribed me Trazodone 50 mg. What is your experience with this drug and did you find it helpful?
NotSignal	I can't really tell, but I didn't do stuff that would disrupt it, but i guess I was at the end of stage 2 of sleep and then at 6 I woke up.
Signal	I've learned a few things about my insomnia over the last year. Sleep hygeine helps. Being anxious about things in other areas of my life hurts. Being tired makes the insomnia more likely to crop up, which is unfortunate. However, there are a few pieces of my insomnia I just can't seem to figure out. If I fail to fall asleep on the first try of the night, I'm often up for hours- sometimes the rest of the night. Often, I just can't relax, and my thoughts start racing. I don't know how to relax my body and quiet my mind. I sometimes suffer from anxiety over whether or not I'll be able to sleep. Therapist suggested reminding myself that I can function with insomnia, but when I'm upset over being tense *right now*, and not over tomorrow, it doesn't really help. Any advice on books to read or therapies that could help?
Signal	Can anyone help me? I used to get 12 hours of sleep as that’s what I need, but lately I’ve been getting an average of 5. I tried sleepy tea mixed with my regular sleeping pill dose which usually works, especially because I hadn’t taken the pills in a while, no luck. Tried meditation and asmr, no luck. Tried listening to weightless (instrumental meant for sleep), no luck. Tried doubling my sleeping pill dose. No luck. I’m exhausted all day and get headaches from how little sleep I get. I’m moody and feel like shit. Any ideas?
Signal	Okay so Ive had insomnia in the past (mostly stress related). It ended when I was mentally in a better place and things were okay. Anyway, as time moved on I realized I have a sort of seasonal depression (?), if thats a thing, nothing triggers it and if youre thinking about whether ive gone to a therapist or not, then yes I have. It was a horrible experience that left me scarred and I dont think i’ll go back or even try a new one but regardless i guess i’m more in control due to the amazing support I have. Anyway, enough of the background story, so ive been having trouble falling asleep again. But now its mostly that my brain is so hyperactive and theres a sort of noise that I hear and cant turn off... its mostly late at night when i’m all alone in my room and I close my eyes, I think about the most horrible things, all my worst fears play over and over again in my head.. and even things that I didnt know scared me. Im left trembling, in tears and unable to sleep that entire night. I usually call a friend or mostly my boyfriend and wake them up, they talk to me and distract me. it does help, if im honest.I dont want to constantly depend on anyone, Im terrified of going to sleep now and closing my eyes in bed because i know it’ll happen again. I dont know if its an actual disorder and because of the quarantine situation i’m stuck at home. So, thats all. I’d love to hear if anyone has faced a similar issue or knows of something that could help me.
NotSignal	http://imgur.com/a/L1CU5oC here's what I gotta deal with since all this sleep issue crap started. anybody have a similar issue and if so is there anything that can help outside of the obvious getting more sleep? Hah. They just seem to get worse and I'm super self conscious about them and that probably drives my anxiety and making it harder to sleep idk
NotSignal	I haven’t been traveling or busy I just, haven’t been able to sleep. For my entire life I just haven’t been able to sleep but today takes the fucking cake. I don’t know if I should even try at this point, maybe I’ll just never sleep again.
Signal	I've been taking ambien at doses 1.25 mg 5 times a week and 2 mg benzodiazepine once a week for 5 years. Only recently not only i have insomnia but i have shakes and anxiety while i try sleep. Especially as i'm about to drift into sleep my muscles jerk and wake me up.
Signal	My whole life I have never been able to feel rejuvenated or refreshed even if I get a good nights sleep. I constantly feel exhausted, and I’m so used to the feeling of being exhausted all the time, that it doesn’t even bother me. It just keeps building up and up, until the point where I fall asleep naturally, leading me to feel well rested only for a day, before the exhaustion sets in again. It doesn’t help that I sleep like the dead (my heartbeat drops, I don’t move, or make noise) and it worries my family. Because there are a few nights every year or so, where I go into almost a semi-comatose state. By that, I mean that I fall into such a deep sleep, that I don’t respond to anything they do to wake me up, I don’t move or speak, and once again my heartbeat drops. I sleep for maybe 10-12 hours before finally waking up. I’ve tried everything to fall asleep and get a good night sleep at night, or at least feel awake during the day, but nothing works.... Medicine of any kind (From Prescription to Over the Counter) paralyzes me as I fall asleep, my body adjusts to Melatonin so fast that within two weeks I need 16 1 mg doses to even feel up to sleeping, Caffeine has no effect on me in a healthy dosage, and Sleep Rituals don’t work. I’ve never seen anyone about it but, I just turned sixteen and I can’t take it anymore. I can’t take the constant exhaustion, the Tension Headaches from a mix of Stress and Exhaustion, the irritation and anxiety of my sleep schedule getting messed up, because sleeping at a different time each night makes me feel like shit. And I’m sick of waking up and only having energy for a few hours before I have to start doing active things and occupying my mind from focusing on the exhaustion. Can someone please... Please give me any ideas as to what’s wrong with me? I talk to my doctor about because they always recommend Melatonin and we can’t afford to get a Brain Scan. I’m sorry this was so long. I just want to finally understand why I have to suffer like this.
Signal	I am on temazepam and federal regulations say I can’t get a refill until 2 days before and it’s only for 30 day supply. I believe the American pharma association asked for waiving the limits currently due to more states doing shelter in place - my pharmacy is doing delivery but not on weekends - I finally found something to help me and now I’m risking not having a continuous supply. This is so disappointing.
NotSignal	I tend to have very messy sleeping schedules, as you guys may or may not relate to, so when I can't sleep, I can't exactly just stay awake for the rest of my day because my father thinks it's unhealthy, which it is, but I just can't seem to find another way to fix my sleeping schedule than just hoping that I can stay awake long enough for when he goes to work, and I can get up take a bath and do my routine so I can sleep later in the day. Anyone else have to do this? Or is it just me?
NotSignal	I know of the groggy hangover side effect so I'm gonna take it a bit earlier than usual, at 830. I'm also aware of the nasty metallic taste side effect. (Btw if anyone knows how to get rid of it let me know). But you know what? I need to sleep. I cant do this shit anymore man. I dont care what the hell the wierd side effects are I just want to wake up like a normal person every day, feel refreshed and accomplish things. I want to pursue my career and become successful and my insomnia is preventing it completely. Its a nightmare.So please just wish me some luck. I really need it tonight
Signal	I’m 26m and have had trouble sleeping since I was a kid. The last few years I think I’ve found a routine that works somewhat. I take 50-75 mg of Benadryl 2-3 nights a week, 7.5-10 mg of ambien the other 2-3 nights a week, and then I’m usually drunk enough the other nights in the week to just pass out. I do this to avoid building up a tolerance to ambien and because I don’t want to become physically addicted to it. I also want to avoid taking Benadryl too much because I’ve read multiple studies that say Benadryl can lead to memory problems later in life if taken excessively. The thing is though, I actually think the Benadryl helps me get to sleep and stay asleep better than ambien. I guess I always thought of ambien as being better because it’s prescription, but Benadryl might just work better. Does this happen for anyone else?
NotSignal	I went to bed at 11:00 and woke up at 2:00, can't fall back asleep. I don't have anything planned today but man, I don't know what to do. I lost my job yesterday which explains the anxiety but this never happened before?! Usually I can fall back asleep within a few hours...
Signal	I take 0.5 mg melatonin the night before. My mood next day is weird and have extreme hunger. I can’t fall asleep without melatonin though. Help!
Signal	I’m 14 and I’ve got pretty nasty insomnia. My parents don’t believe me because they think I’m just staying up all night playing games. I really need help because I’ve been getting 4 hours of sleep every night and stealing energy drinks to keep me semi-awake. It’s making me depressed because I keep failing easy tests and forgetting my entire school bag or forgetting to put on a shirt. The baseline of this post is that I need to convince my parents that I have insomnia or I will kill myself. It would also really help me out if you could tell me some adverse affects of my sleep pattern and some “medication alternatives” if my parents don’t believe me
Signal	I'll just wake up and typically fall back asleep fine (sometimes it's harder though) and it makes me feel significantly groggier in the mornings. I fall asleep fine when I get in bed for the night but I'll wake up 2-3 times a night and with school going on it's really worrying me because I've been more tired lately. Does anyone know what this is or how to deal with it? I'm going to try melatonin
NotSignal	I’m looking for something that will help me sleep longer and uninterrupted.
NotSignal	...and I slwpt through the night! It wasn't the best sleep, but it was good enough for me
Signal	When it started, I tried wearing myself down for a week by running for a couple miles. I even improved my diet just so I could continue to benefit from my exercise. My whole body started hurting, so I switch to walking everyday for a week 2x a day. None of that helped.I have told my therapist and psychiatrist what is going on, and they script me stuff that doesn’t even work (Seroquel 100mg, Trazadone 150mg, Upping my dose of Gabapentin). None of it helps. I got enrolled in CBT-I, and now I’m so tossed from lack of sleep I gave up on that. How can I be expected to care about myself when I can’t even get a day of good sleep, and my doctors dont seem to be helping.Three days ago I called the psychiatrist office and they only had someone from adult family medicine to talk to me. They suggested all of the same shit I have already tried, then suggested a ton of supplements and herbs that I’ve already tried (as someone who worked in a vitamin dept. I’ve tried a lot of supplements...).Well I went out and bought them anyway, didn’t help. Then I called my psychiatrist and left a message, she told me to wait until I have an appointment or call the psychiatrist office if it is urgent... I ALREADY DID THAT LIKE 4 TIMES NOW AND NO ONE SEEMS TO GIVE A SHIT!I have considered going to the hospital, which i never do because I have a lot of trauma that stems from hospitals. I’ve even tried hitting my head against a wall with no luck, I am that desperate. I’m so tired and angry at my doctors it’s all I think about all day.
NotSignal	about to go to sleep anyone recommend anything before a try to sleep
Signal	You guys want to know what I hate?? The fact that I have tried every stupid piece of advice I've ever read for the past 20 years, and still can't stay asleep at night for over an hour at a time. "Don't take naps, reset your sleep schedule" is every stupid person's advice. Naps are the only thing that keep me from being completely insane. The other thing I hate is the fact that benzos are life changing for me, and allow me to actually fall asleep at night. Considering how poor of an idea it is to take them nightly, it's like they are just their teasing me. I take them for about a week straight, every night, every 4 to 6 months to "catch up" on sleep for the year. Its fucked up, but I think its saved me from killing myself a couple of times. Ugh I'm so frustrated.
NotSignal	I woke up after a hour or tough sleep . Litterally puked. It was all foamy and gassy. Acidy it fucking burns my throat
Signal	idk if i even slept this night its just been a slurr or smth i just lay in my bed for and hour and cant sleep. Muscles fully relaxed, breathing undrr controle. 2 hours later not asleep. I tried everything and im quitting sleep for tonght. its 2:35 and i want to die. Im not trying anymore. I swear to god im not trying anymore. This is going on for 5 days in a row. i slept 1 hour yesterday and slept 3 the day before and then 2 and 4 and 0. I wanna fall asleep, or die. One of the 2. i cant stand being awake. FUCK
NotSignal	Is panic attack in the middle of the night normal... I got shit scared yesterday I was trying to sleep and I just felt like a 50kg stone just landed on my heart and for it to recover it had to beat fast and I just swallowed some saliva imidiatly and my body just went numb, I could not breath and it felt like something was pushing me down just above the water. I could breathe in but nothing was coming out (or was it the other way around... Idk)I feel/have* depression *anxiety * panic attack* paranoia * life joy under 0Recently my girl broke up with me I'm a 24years old (M) I have no allergies and no heart problems. I have trouble putting rest to my eyes for the past 4 months.I've been seeing a doctor for a while now but nothing good comes out from it. Pls some help?
NotSignal	Im scared because before this I could go into sleep even for one hour. This time nothing, I don't even feel the twitch before sleep. I am in pain, my joints and back hurt and my leg muscles keep contracting. There is a bad heatwave don't know if this caused it but something is wrong with my brain. I just sit motionless for hours untill my limbs go numb hoping I will sleep, my stomach keeps churning. I can barely think anymore. I think I will die alone because of this and the heat during the day.
NotSignal	Primary insomnia is not caused by anxiety, depression, or something else. It just means your body physically has trouble sleeping. There probably is some cause of it, but medical science isn’t there yet...If you do have primary insomnia, has anything worked well long term? What I’ve read is that these folks are kind of screwed because CBTi often doesn’t work and drug treatments only work temporarily and make the problem worse in the long run.
NotSignal	Everytime I try to sleep I internally shake. Either in my chest or down my leg. It doesnt stop and I end up in panic attacks. I dont actually shake it's just a feeling in my core and it's getting worse. Its only when I'm falling asleep. I'm going absolutely crazy.
Signal	I was prescribed 5mg of ambien a few days ago because my insomnia is so bad right now. I’ve been feeling drowsy when I wake up after taking the full dose, and it’s not helpful when I have meetings early in the morning. Has anyone experimented with taking 1/2 or 1/4 of a 5mg tablet? Does that work?
NotSignal	I went through a mysterious medical ordeal a year and a half ago that almost destroyed my life, and a lot of the torture I endured sprung from reading about this disease and convincing myself that I had it. This is a warning to anyone who has gone down this rabbit hole. If you do not know what SFI is, do not google it, do not read about it, especially if you have health anxiety. It’s basically one of the rarest diseases on the planet and it’s virtually impossible that you have it, but it’s so nightmarish that it will drive you crazy if you think that you do. In February of 2019 I started experiencing weird physical symptoms. It started oddly enough with faint nausea that turned into complete inability to eat and then almost total insomnia. I lost massive amounts of weight, had daily tremors, my heart was constantly racing out of control. Scarily enough I never found out what was causing my health problems. No one understood it. I had so many tests - a full body CT scan, an MRI, multiple chest x-rays, ultrasounds, an endoscopy, tons of blood work. Since then I’ve gone through periods of remission and relapse. While there may be some underlying medical cause, I think 80% of what I went through generated from this belief that I had SFI. I had read about the disease a year or so before my symptoms started, and for whatever reason got this idea that it was the only explanation for what was happening to me because I remembered some stray detail in an article that it sometimes causes weird symptoms like coughing. No one and nothing could convince me otherwise. I started seeing a psychiatrist who clearly thought I was off my rocker and had never heard of the disease. Family and friends tried to assure me that my statistical chances of having the disease were nil, but I just had this unshakeable faith that I did.It was shocking and sad to me when I came on this forum a couple of months ago and saw the number of posts about SFI. There’s something about this disease that captures people’s imaginations and destroys their psyche. I almost wish that google would remove it from their pages because it’s dangerous/contagious information. If you are reading this and think you have SFI, know that you do not have and you are not alone.
NotSignal	I sleep little, but usually it's more for a lack of trying. I don't have the motivation to move and go in bed, even though I spend most of my day on a chair right next to my bed. I'm not sure I have as much trouble falling asleep than I do getting the motivation to go sleep and face my thoughts. In the end some nights I don't sleep, others I'll sleep for a couple hours. So, is this insomnia, or is this just depression? I'm guessing the latter based off of what others have said in this subreddit, but I was wondering if insomnia was broader than just not being able to fall asleep. I'm sorry if this is worded in a confusing manner..
NotSignal	Hi all,Currently I do have bouts of sleep maintenance issues. Typically, this means waking up in the middle of the night. I do know of the rule where you get out of bed and do something else, but for those that do 'do something else', what are your activities?I am thinking of getting a night lamp that is dim enough but still able to read without having to turn on the actual lights that will be too bright and thus wake you even more. Usually I try my best to do meditation or end up watching low-intense videos that don't really require a conscious attention to it, this helps because I think I need an external source to keep my thoughts occupied. However, the meditation doesn't always work and I don't know if I like guided ones enough as I'll have to fiddle on my phone to get a playback of it. And yes - bluelight/screen-use bla bla. I find this 'rule' is hit-or-miss and varies from individual to individual. I don't think it's ever caused me too many issues, especially during onset, where my onset is quite good :)Whats helped me the most is not caring as much (A.C.T), but you do get the occasional bad periods...\-What do you guys do? Generally, from my experience, I find CBT-I to work more for onset issues rather than maintenance.
NotSignal	Life feels so strange right now, I know.I want to genuinely hear how you guys are doing.I’m a wreck. If you’re wondering.
NotSignal	It’s a herbal tea, the thing works to make you sleepy that’s for sure. Made me sleep like a baby. Thought I’d recommend it on here.
Signal	I get enough sleep, but it's at the wrong time. I generally try to be in bed before midnight. It would be earlier but I know that there is no chance of sleeping before then. I typically fall asleep around 5am which means that I'm in bed til noon to get my 7 hours. This is bothering me as I really worry about how I'm using my time on earth. Im just about to turn 31 but I'm counting down the days. I hate that even though I'm awake just as much as other people and experiencing the same amount of life, a lot of my experience is spending hours lying in bed doing nothing but getting frustrated that I'm not sleeping and wasting my life. I just can't get my brain to shut off at night. I have no control over it or what it thinks. Some times it's general worries, particularly if something specific has been brought up in the day, but normally it's insane shit that seems to make sense until I suddenly realise its nonsense. A few minutes later it's back to nonsense again. Leaving a dim light on and some kind of noise, TV, call in show, podcast etc used to do the trick and occupy my mind on a level where I wouldn't be actively thinking about what I was listening to but I wouldn't start thinking uncontrollable nonsense either and could fall asleep. Lately it just doesn't work and I either listen to what's being said or the nonsense comes back. I've never looked into treatment because my social anxiety prevents me seeing a doctor about it. If anyone here could offer advice that they think might help with my sleep situation I'd be very greatful and I promise to try and put it into practice. I've noticed uncontrollable thinking has been mentioned by others so I'm hopeful that someone may have some good advice.
NotSignal	So probably about 50% of my dreams are lucid or semi lucid dreams. Last night I was tossing and turning for 4 or 5 hours until I finally fell asleep and starting dreaming. When I realized I was dreaming, I got so excited that I was finally sleeping that I woke myself up and didn’t go back to sleep that night. So that was fun.
NotSignal	It’d be great if we could create the Christian mingle or farmers only version of insomniac dating. Make some tinder app and call it something stupid like insomniac interest or sleepless singles. Could save a lot of us from that awkward conversation where we have to explain why we’re still awake in the bedroom shuffling around and counting the minutes until the sun will rise and Jeff stops snoring
Signal	I used to struggle falling asleep but I was prescribed Trazodone which helps me fall asleep. Now though I still wake up every 30-60 minutes which makes it impossible to complete a full cycle of sleep. Usually I’ll wake up after a dream or nightmare. Any good meds anyone’s tried?
Signal	I had a few sleeplessness nights and am worried that I won't be able to sleep again. Does anyone have a fix or if I should go to a doctor?
Signal	I generally wake up all night every 1, 2, or 3 hours. Luckily I usually don’t have trouble falling back asleep (unless it’s after sunrise already). Even though my sleep adds up to 7 hours asleep most nights, I generally feel tired and crappy, especially in the morning, indicating that clearly my sleep quantity or quality isn’t good enough. My doctor put me on Gabapentin pills before bed but it doesn’t seem to be helping much. Curious to hear your experiences! Thanks.
NotSignal	I'm a 16 year old male, no known health problems, physically or mentally, but basically the past few days I've been wondering how normal or irregular my sleep patterns are.No doubt in my mind that I have chronic insomnia. For the past 5 years I've stayed up until at least 3AM despite having school at 8 in the morning.I'm in high school now, going into grade 11 but during grade 10 I would skip school very regularly, giving me freedom to stay awake until whatever time and not feel like I would have any responsibilities the next day.Now that quarantine has given me that exact same freedom, it's been really showing the past few months. I don't feel unhealthy at all or like what I'm doing is unhealthy but I really don't know because I can't find anything online relating to it.Now here's what I've been doing: I will stay awake for 24 hours roughly without feeling the slightest bit tired, I'll stay up maybe a few more hours from the time I decide I want to sleep because there's usually a few things I want to do, whether it be some achievements in the games I'm currently playing or having a fire with a friend at 5 in the morning. 24-30 hours on average spent awake, no naps, coffee, or anything that should keep me awake. Once I actually do fall asleep, the time asleep varies DRASTICALLY. Let me say this, I NEVER feel like my sleep quality is any different from any amount of sleep. It always feels pretty "normal" (only way I can think of describing it) but when I do fall asleep it ranges from 6-24 hours, most commonly being 12-16 hours, slightly less commonly for the amounts higher or lower than that, but overall seems quite even to me.Throughout the years I've had moments where I stay awake around 4 days. If I were to put these 5 years into a percentage amount where I stay awake an entire day, I would say it would be around 30% until recently where it's around 90%.I don't take any medicine for anything, I eat once a day that I classify as "dinner" always being at around the 20 hour mark, also being at whatever time happens to be the 20 hour mark. I drink around 1-2L of water a day. The time of day seems to have lost meaning in relation to anything I do (aside from the set times where my mom would come home or the time I would ideally stream). I smoke weed regularly, and it helps me fall asleep very fast if I have been awake long enough and want to sleep. Not sure what else I should mention but I probably forgot some things.I'm not sure if I should be concerned at all or seek any kind of help, but if any of you are knowledgeable enough on this, I'd like to know what you have to say.
Signal	I’m on the luckier side of epilepsy, but DAMN I got messed up bad from this last week.I’ll typically have about a week or two after a cluster of small seizures where all my chronic pain, food issues, mental problems, just everything is worse. And this includes my insomnia. I’m somewhat used to this but I had seizure activity over three days in a row and holy hell. Sleep maaayybe 4 hours, don’t sleep at all for over 24 hours then sleep another 4. Stay up till the sun is out cause my brain won’t shut up, then slip into bed with the blissfully sleeping boyfriend. Only to get a headache staring at the ceiling for the next 3 hours.Guess what happens next....yeah that’s right😉Sleep only 1.5 hours. Repeat for the last idk how many days cause my head is fried like I did too many psychedelics.I’ve always had the troubles falling sleep, staying asleep, tired all the time and what not since I was a kid, but this is just rude.
NotSignal	I apologize for my horrible grammar I’m new to reddit and I made this in hopes maybe helping someone who might have experienced this &amp; is looking for answers or just somebody to relate to.I won’t get into my life story because I’ll be here all day so I’ll try to focus on the subject at hand but I Will say I’m a 25 year old high school drop out I’m black &amp; pretty much fit the stereotypical description of a young black person I have face tattoos I wear clothes that I clearly can’t afford and I have an obvious drug problem your parents would probably tell you stay away from me for your own good. I’ve always been different from my peers I was always more progressive I’ve never let my environment influence my beliefs and thoughts and I pretty much accept any and everybody no matter who they were It’s cringy to say but I’m basically the person in school who bullied the bullies for you like the unexpected friend you never thought even knew you existed I’m not trying to make myself out to be the super cool guy because I’m far from it but Im somewhat popular mostly due to my size, I’m big as fuck lol the fat guy who got girls and nobody ever knew why I was too funny and too big to bully most people weren’t going to win with jokes or a fight so I kind of just fell into the position I’m in now I was also very known for having access to everything illegal that teenagers shouldn’t have access to guns, drugs, older women , I could even take you to get your first tattoo without Id probably by some crack head in a basement but hey you get what you can get I’ve also had a couple stays in the psych ward that most of my friends don’t know about I won’t get into but I’ll say I’ve had a very hard life that I usually keep tucked away not because I’m ashamed but I’ve always preferred listening to others life stories and seeing how I can help and I’ve always been more concerned about putting a smile on others face maybe it was the typical defensive mechanism that hurt people use to avoid their own pains and trauma either way it doesn’t matter lol I just kind of wanted to give you a small idea of who I was before I get started but here we go.I’ve always been an e pill, Molly user since I was 16 I can honestly say that I have an addiction I never hid it I always knew I was addicted and have been since a teen and I’m not looking for help for it. The past two weeks have completely altered my already wide view of life it started out as a regular binge I usually start off with 3 pills and by the end of the night I’ll be at 6 or 7 I also suffer from chronic insomnia so it’s basically mixing fire with Fire I’ll stay up for maybe 3 to 5 days straight just in the zone I’ve never got sexual feelings from it and it never made me want to be around a crowd the higher I get the more I tend to isolate myself I use that time to analyze myself, make money, and research anything I possibly can basically it’s like my Adderall. So anyway it started out as a normal night knowing I was going to go on a binge me and my friend brought a couple girls to a hotel and honestly they were really nice people I got them high off e and listened to them vent about their deepest darkest secrets for about 5-6 hours they wanted to have sex after but I truly just don’t believe in having sex with somebody that’s under the influence unless we have had sex completely sober before I’ve always hated the thought of taking advantage of women especially since I’m the one supplying the drugs most of the time, I grew up with only my mom and I’m the only boy in a family full of sisters and my only child is my 3 yr old daughter so I take things like rape personally and so do my friends. I ended leaving my friend in the hotel to have his own party with them I just drove around on dark roads thinking about life until I saw the sun coming up. Mission complete like always I had a good night and met some girls who think I’m their soul mate now regular shit day 2 of my binge I spent to myself at this point I think I was about 15 pills in (I always have a large supply over e lol) it went normal I spent most of my day writing,and venting in my notepad like always and day 3 went exactly the same at that point I was about 20-25 pills before I even noticed I was 6 days into a drug binge no sleep,no food just pills water and cigarettes but day 6 is when I started to notice that I was hallucinating (IT MY FIRST TIME HALLUCINATING) I had never made it to 6 days of no sleep not for any reason specifically but I usually just clock out by day 3-5 but I kept going this time. I was in the back of my friends car we were having a regular night then I started to notice little things like I didn’t remember even leaving the house, at that point I didn’t have any text messages or phone calls with my friends speaking about meeting up but the car ride was so vivid I could even feel the bumps in the road, I could feel the vibration of the speakers blasting music but the entire time I felt something was off and I kept repeating it to “my friends” like guys how is this possible guys none of us even spoke today GUYS I DONT EVEN REMEMBER GETTING DRESSED AND LEAVING THE HOUSE. I don’t remember coming home that night I just remember going from the car to laying in my bed but I was aware that something strange was happening like I stated before I have never had a hallucination in my life the thing that freaked me out was my friends being there if I was just by myself I would have easily just chalked it up to me tweaking the fuck out. I ended up just chalking it up to me having a dream maybe I feel asleep for 20 minutes and didn’t notice I stayed up for the rest of that night at this point I lost count of how many pills I had taken I just know it was a lot that night I had continued to hallucinate I ended up having a conversation with my “friend” that lasted all night venting about my life and childhood trauma he was in the corner in my room and I never saw his face just a shadow but I knew the voice we talked until the sun came up and at this point I was aware that I was hallucinating but at the time apart of my mind thought it was real because it was was so vivid even the memories were vivid as can be but at this point I was fully fucked up and didn’t really even care to find out what was happening but all of this was new, It went from just being my friend in the room to hearing more voices but this time they were under my bed making funny comments and everything lol like it smells down here and lose some weight you’re crushing us after about 4 hours of bullshit conversation with the people under my bed I started asking hey are you guys demons? Because I didn’t understand why these hallucinations were lasting so long I had never experienced them but something made me believe there was some kind of time limit of them like I have to snap out of it eventually but once I started to ask if they were demons it’s like the entire energy in the room shifted things started to get more serious and one of them finally called out and said yes were demons, they told me the devil had chosen me because of my “dark side” my entire life I’ve always felt like I had two people in my head one of them being my pure self the caring one I know that’s me at heart and then there’s the “other” the bad one I feel like it’s the monster that my childhood trauma created I wasn’t born with it most of my life there was a war going on in my head I have 100000 thoughts in a second and sometimes I speak loud by accident because I literally can’t hear myself over the “good” and the “bad” arguing in my head I’ve learned over the years to just tune it all out I’m fully aware that it’s most likely the result of having a horrible life Ive never thought that my bad side was an actual person or a demon that lived inside me or some shit I’m a realist and I basically had to teach myself everything I could about mental health just so I could understand myself I taught myself that most of my life was spent in survival mode I went most of my life not feeling any emotion I faked every smile and faked every laugh besides the ones that I had with my mother she was the only one who could provoke emotion out of me but other than that complete numbness I went to my fathers funeral as a child and stood over his casket and didn’t shed a tear I didn’t feel bad at all and he was my best friend, so from then on I started to question why can’t I feel like everyone else? why am I so numb? Why can’t I love? Why don’t I feel self importance? It took me all the way until I was 22 years old having my daughter to realize I was in survival mode the day my daughter was born was like literally being crushed by a building everything hit me at once all the trauma all the sadness,hatred, happiness, all the feelings hit me at once I started to cry and couldn’t stop it I was crying tears of joy and sadness at the same time and from then on I’ve felt my emotions non stop everything is still very raw I have to hide in the bathroom at least 3 times a day no matter where I am because I cry uncontrollably no matter what mood I’m in and honestly it feels so fucking good bro it feels like I’m shedding everything and finally becoming the man I need to for my family but that’s besides the point we can talk about that later for those who stay lol but anyway the “demons” started to tell me the devil basically wanted to do business and I was fully prepared to negotiate I’ve never really had fear in my life I only feared my mom dying so I went in saying “I know what I’m worth and I know having my soul means a lot I’m not supposed to go to hell” and that’s something that I truly believe despite that I’m an atheist well not so much anymore but I knew my heart was good I knew very well that my good karma out weighs the bad and if I deserve to be anywhere it’s in heaven not because I believe I’m special but because I’ve basically used myself as a walking mat for others my entire life it always felt good for me to take the entire weight of somebody’s pain and insecurities and dump it on myself to make them happy I’ve never gotten joy out of anything I did for myself besides drugs, fucking, and taking a shit I’ve always gravitated to the most damaged people I can find , the scum of the earth , the losers , the psychopaths and the misunderstood if the world hates you 9 times out of 10 I’m going to try to love you unless your just flat out a piece of shit It never mattered how dark something was I’m walking in head first no worries even if it’s the devil himself lol that’s kind of a perc of having a shitty life so anyway I knew how much my soul meant but I also knew how bad my “other” can get I know how influential I could be so if I wanted to lead an entire football field of people into hell I could do it without breaking a sweat I could sense weakness I could sense what’s wrong with you as soon as I meet you and I can guess a fairly accurate description of your life within the first 10 mins of conversation 5 minutes if I’m under pressure lol a few people really think I’m some kind of psychic but really I just guessed the shit so I knew I was worth a lot either way it’s a double whammy my soul is good but I could also bring a million good souls down here with me with a smile on my face if I chose to give in to the “other” I never spoke to the devil myself he just sent demons to speak for him lol one of the demons was literally my best friend (the same one I was at the hotel with the same one that I hallucinated having an all night convo with) Basically I found out he was fucking dead in the same day everything was so vivid and I started to cry very real tears realizing my best friend is dead and on top of it he went to hell the funny thing is even through him being a hallucination demon we never lost our bond he would say little things to try and influence me to sell my soul but in the same sentence you know he “HE” made me do that so don’t listen. Lol even during the process of me selling my soul we were planning on how to take over hell together and free all the tortured souls. I have to end the story here because it’s 4:36 a.m and I really just don’t feel like typing anymore I will be back as soon as I wake up to tell the rest because this is when it starts getting good lol .Be safe everyone
Signal	Hi, 19F here. I’m kinda at my wits end. I wake up at 2 am every morning no matter how late I stay up. I stay up till 1:30 am? Sure enough my eyes are peeling open to look at my phone at 2 am. And when I try to sleep after that I can only force myself to half-sleep for about 20-30 minutes before I’m wide awake again. I had no previous habit of waking up like this, it suddenly started happening almost a month ago. I’m tired no matter what, and I have no trouble taking naps. Melatonin doesn’t work, ive even switched from non-drowsy benadryl to the drowsy formula and it doesn’t make me feel anything. I’ve tried tea, changing what I eat, reading, drawing. I just can’t get any uninterrupted sleep and it’s almost completely drained me. Not sure what posting this is gonna do but it’s nice to have somewhere to vent about it and read similar experiences. :)
Signal	I was injured at work 12weeks ago and due to pain and surgeries, have lost my ability to sleep. Does anyone have any suggestions to help past the time? TV shows,books,movies, chat rooms. Something? The isolation of being alone is making me crazy, and angry with people. Help! Btw, this is my first ever post.
NotSignal	I think its a very important case for people to hear about or read about in regards to Sporadic Fatal Insomnia. I was planning initially to go over all the available literature, but this case basically sums up every other case as well as highlighting key clinical features throughout the progression of the disease. Sorry for rambling a lot i'm pretty sleep deprived(obviously why i'm here :P) If you want more I can go over more and give a more thorough explanation but this case as I said is pretty much the best way of explaining how things would actually progress. I say uhh and you know a lot so you can tell this is one take and I am absolutely too tired to edit everything to how it should be but hopefully that isn't too annoying I also sound dumb so sorry about that too.Hopefully this helps you relax and possibly sleep better ;)
NotSignal	Guys: CBTI (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) sucks. Yes, it's super effective, but good lord does it kick your ass, especially in the early stages. So it occurred to me, last night, while I was struggling to stay awake, that one of the worst parts of doing it was feeling completely alone. But then I realised: if people can have workout buddies, and swim partners, then why the fuck can't we do something similar for CBTI? Two or more people doing it together, supporting each other through the tough parts. Even it's just via DMs.Is there anyone else on this sub giving it a crack? If so, what do you say about partnering up?
NotSignal	As far as I know, every sleeping pill is associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Does anyone know of any literature comparing just how bad this effect is with different pills?
Signal	I've seen various doctors over the years about my insomnia and they have prescribed different meds, though someone just suggested low doeses of Trazodone as an option. I know nothing about it, and supposedly it is not addictive. Does anyone know anything about it or have any experience with it?Thanks.
NotSignal	Just really curious if it’s the same for a lot of people, for me it started with my depression. Now that I’m not really depressed anymore it is mainly my anxiety and how my mind just doesn’t shut off. Best of luck to anyone with this frustrating problem.
NotSignal	Is this good for a 15 year old boy? I always sleep at 12am-3am and end up waking at 8am, sometimes i sleep at 5am and waking up at 10am. Whenever i sleep at 9pm i ended up waking at 1am or 12am
Signal	It’s hard to explain because once I’m properly awake it doesn’t make any sense. But the dreams are like a computer bug, they loop around a few scenarios and there is something missing or something I need to solve in order to continue. It wakes me up and it feels real and it makes me anxious and nauseous, it makes me feel I can’t sleep until it’s solved. Kind of like lucid dreaming. This happens over and over while I toss and turn each time. After a while I can become aware enough to try and snap myself out of it and go to another room and turn lights on and do something at 4am to make my mind realize there is no problem. I’ll usually need Xanax to get back to sleep. This happens most nights and is driving me mad and causing me to be burnt out during the day.Does anyone else experience this or know what it is?
Signal	i haven’t slept in,.... 2 days? 50 hrs? im not sure i lost track. but here’s the thing.. when i have insomnia im usually extremely tired, i’d be looking like a walking corpse. but im surprisingly energetic.. not mania energy but its a weird buzz.. i don’t know honestly. been dissociating a lot so thats uh.. uncomfortable.. :/ also last time i tried to sleep i slept for 1 hour only because i kept feeling bugs crawling all over me... i turned on the lights & checked my sheets but nothing was there
NotSignal	Does anyone find they literally cannot sleep at all and will stay awake 48 hours if they try not to take any? My only mental health issue is severe ADHD I'm not bipolar or anything I was given this purely for sleep but I want to quit this medication. I have managed to get it down to only 25 from a much higher dose but if I try to go without that no sleep at all.
NotSignal	all I'm left with are the words"go to sleep. stop existing. dont be concious."I cant even sleep as an escape, and when I do I have nightmares. this is why hurting myself worked so well for me, but I'm trying to stop that. I relapse about every month, but it never gets dangerous or anything. a cut a month isnt so bad, right? I feel like I'm letting everyone down, I honestly don't know anymore.
Signal	Been sleeping around 5-6 hours per night this week and the psychotic symptoms are still mostly there. It really fucking sucks and I wish I hadn't had stayed up as long as I did and fucked up my brain. It is what it is I guess.
NotSignal	So as the title says, I'm struggling with this quite a while now. I'm 33 and I cant even remember when it started. I'm sure it had to do with my 7y older brother who slept in the same room and didn't turn the light off before midnight, that and some other stuff. Being awake became a habit and it got harder and harder for me to fall asleep. I've dark spots and wrinkles around my eyes, I often have difficulties concentrating and articulating. When I come home from a 12h workday I'm totally trashed but still can't fall asleep.BUT it got better, now instead of taking 2h or more to fall asleep I can mange to sleep after 45minutes - that's still very long considering that a normal person takes something around 7 minutes. My wife can fall asleep instantly!Okay so here's what I did to get improve my situation, maybe it's good advice for some of you.Just 3 things:1.I don't have coffee or black tea after 4pm2.I developed the habit of always trying to sleep at 10pm, never much later.3. If I feel I'll have a difficult time to sleep, I'll take melatonin.So melatonin helped me I think for the most part psychologically, I worry less that the upcoming night will be a short one. It also really does what it's for, namely making me tired.This medication is not like other sleeping pills. It's a compound that's produced by the body. It has almost no effect after the sleep - no dizzyness or anything. You can't OD on it, which is good cause most melatonin brands are in way too high doses - you'd just need a little.If your interested, read about it online. It helped me, and I can't recommend it enough.But as I kinda said before, my insomnia is milder, it's better, but it's not a resolved issue. I still have all the problems I had before. Just not as bad. Good luck everyone!
NotSignal	48 hours and I still haven’t gotten any sleep despite my best efforts. Oh and I’m also on anti depressants that are supposed to help with sleep issues. Wtf is wrong with me.Usually around about this time I start hallucinating or some shit 😜😜😜 FUN!!!When it’s gone longer than this, at least I start straight up passing out. That’s really disorientating but at least my body eventually forces me to sleep.
Signal	The time spent laying in bed not sleeping and the countless hours half awake in the daytime really isn't productive.I've realized what a waste of time insomnia is but it's so damn hard to fix.Have you ever wondered how different life would be if insomnia didn't exist?
NotSignal	I have insane insomnia and stay up nights on end but its due to my schizophrenia so not much fix there but i do want advice for my girlfriend, shes moving in soon and i know sleeping next to one another will help her a bit but is there anyway i can make her super comfy at night and secure to help ease her insomnia?
NotSignal	Hi guys,Hope you are all keeping well. I just wanted to ask, do you find your insomnia causes you to suffer with dissociation/derealisation? I’d love to hear some of your experiences regarding the topic and how you deal with it.I know it can help to talk about things, so feel free to also include any additional triggers you believe may be adding to your dissociation, such as a traumatic event or stressor in your life. It’s always good to open up and try to pinpoint exactly what may be causing the issue. I’m here to listen.Thanks guys :)
NotSignal	Usually, I go to bed around 11pm and wake up at 7:30am for school and/or work. Recently, however, my depression decided to have a grand comeback. I now cannot fall asleep until around 1 in the morning, and I wake up around 4am, and cannot fall back asleep.
Signal	i’ve tried just about everything for my insomnia. cbd, teas, melatonin, hydroxyzine, doxapine, mirtrazapine, ambien, elavil, zquil, benadryl, weed, guided meditation, slowed breathing. i rarely fall asleep before 4am and at least once a week i go a full night without any sleep. it’s been like this for almost a year and it’s taking a serious toll on me. right now i’m seeing a therapist, an emdr specialist, and a functional medicine doctor/psychiatrist and i haven’t experienced any relief. i don’t know what to do anymore.
Signal	I had insomnia BAD for 6 months circa 5 or 6 years ago due to work, but I recovered and went back to sleeping like a rock.Nowadays, I still have my job and haven't been furloughed. Zero financial worries or issues as I have no debt and save over 50% of my pay each month. Nobody in my family is sick. I've never feared the virus, I have that "if it happens it happens" mentality over getting it. The only form of "stress" is the annoyance of my flatmates as they're WFH too and love doing DIY and clearouts at 11pm, and every door MUST be slammed.I sleep like a baby. Then after one month of lockdown, one almost sleepless night. No biggy, happens now and then. I get a bit panicked that my insomnia is back. Usually get 2 or 3 in a row then back to normal.Then another bad night, and another. It's been a month now.Circa 5 hours sleep a night, still tossing and turning at 2am just waiting to fall asleep but nothing.My mind isn't racing. I usually lie there, think about something nice and boom, asleep. Not any more. Just can't fall asleep easily like before and it's frustrating.You read about sleep issues and it's always stress, money issues, worries, fear, anxiety. The virus has us scared etc.Nope. None of that.I have anxiety during the day and night now because I can't fall asleep as easily as before, not because I'm worried about something.Naturally my mood has been down for the last month because poor sleep breeds depression/feeling down.This is more annoying than anything else, as 5 hours a night is manageable but it's not enough.And I just don't understand why it's happening.What also annoys me is how the body loves timings. Like the circadian clock will wake me up at 7 every day regardless of anything. Always around 7am.That time never changes.Yet start falling asleep around 2am and it switches to that time in days. Still wakes you up at 7 though.I still get drowsy and head-nodding at 10:30 like usual, get in to bed, lights off after some reading or watching something on YT like always, boom, should fall asleep in minutes. Nope, not any more. Suddenly my heart rate increases and I feel more awake.Like an adrenaline boost or second wind, like panic or anxiety has kicked in or that fight or flight response to a threat that isn't there. And I just roll from side to side waiting to sleep."There's something on your mind"THERE REALLY ISN'T. THAT'S that most annoying thing.
NotSignal	I used to be a vivid dreamer every night I'd dream of different scenarios usually anime related now I get nothing.
NotSignal	I need help fixing my sleep cycle.Normally i slept at midnight to 2am and woke up roughly 8 hours later. Since quarantine I’ve been playing a bunch of video games and totally messed up my schedule. I now sleep at 11am or noon and wake up at around 8pm or so. What is the best way to start sleeping at around midnight again. Now even when it is noon it is hard for me to fall asleep so I’m thinking I keep sleeping an hour or so later every day until I get back to sleeping at midnight. Let me know what you guys think.
Signal	For the past 8 months I’ve found it impossible to sleep. I’ve been taking sleeping pills for most of this time, even tho they only help me sleep 2-4 hours, but when I don’t take them I get no sleep at all. I think I’ve become reliant on them because when I try to sleep without them I go a few days with no sleep at all and then I have to give in and take a pill for a few hours respite from constant wakefulness. I feel like my body/brain has lost the ability to naturally manage my circadian rhythm or whatever. Also I am constantly exhausted and tired but never sleepy at all, I’m “tired but wired” because my body is surviving on adrenaline I guess. I feel like I need to completely relearn how to have a regular wake/sleep cycle but I don’t know how? I’ve tried going cold turkey from the pills but give in after a few days because it’s unbearable. I’ve tried exhausting myself during the day with exercise but instead of tiring me out I end up laying in bed absolutely buzzing with adrenaline like my body has learned it needs to survive without sleep. I just don’t know what else to try!
NotSignal	A bit of background info im 17 I have mild ptsd (I went to a phycatrist when I was 13 but it was to late) from some really messed up stuff I don't want to get into but its getting worse to the point that at night time if I'm not moving I feel so uncomfortable that I'm forced to keep me up the only way I can sleep is around 4-6 which I normally wake up at 8 (all am) normally it was just scattered nights but this has been going on for 4 nights now in a row. Any ideas why and how can I sleep right again.
Signal	Currently on week 2 of CBT-I. Sleep restriction therapy is making me really sleep deprived and I'm feeling quite tired throughout the day. I'm falling asleep a lot faster now, but I still wake up after 1.5-2 hours sleep and am awake for quite a while. Any one have any experience with how long it takes to start sleeping longer during this treatment? I understand this will be individualised but thought there might be a common time frame. I am struggling with this. I'm hoping to have the mental strength to persevere for at least another month.
Signal	apparently my pharmacy is out of ambien. lack of quality, “well rested” sleep really fucks up your mental competence. I literally feel like my IQ has dropped; every mental capacity I have is reduced. really shows when you work in a fast paced, tedious environment. sorry just wanted to rant its late and im experiencing that physical exhaustion combined with anxiety lmao
NotSignal	Ive been sleeping 2 or 3 hours for 3 weeks now and ive been up since 830 am saturday and its 6am sunday. I feel completely awake and i dont know what to do. I drank 3 beers and that usually makes me pass out. I just got a sick feeling and really awake.
NotSignal	Damn, I really think I need to just come off Reddit for a bit and all other social media for that matter. Just before bedtime I always say to myself I'll just look at my phone for 5 or 10 minutes but once I start reading, posting ect it turns into 30 mins or sometimes an hour. So that already makes me late going to bed and then I'm sure that looking at the phone makes it harder to fall asleep.
NotSignal	Hey guys,With what seems like the whole time we’ve been quarantined I’ve been experiencing dreams that occur sometimes only 30mins into sleeping that wake me up. I feel so hopeless in getting a full nights sleep. Most nights I only get 3-4 hours if that. Was wondering if anyone’s in the same boat, cause I feel so alone in having the most fucked up sleep schedule on earth. Peace & Love.
Signal	I woke up with a sore throat at 4 am and had an anxiety attack over it. I'm trying to calm down and need sleep.
Signal	I had never difficuities sleeping before today. I have not slept well for more than 10 days. Right now all i really wish is that i can have a good sleep and i understand now how much important is a good sleep now. I am a uni student and have to wake up early daily and i go gym daily evening. No mater how tired i am i can't fall asleep. I want to go back to normal days and wish that was never happen to me and i feel really hopeless. During daytime , i can't really study well and learn everything. I want to sleep but can't fall asleep.Its 2:37 am in here (i went to bed at 10:30 pm)I want to ask a few questions from you guys and feel free to give tips abut insomnia.1. I have been addicted to playing games all my entire life. Recently the days before i got insomnia , i quit gaming completely and try to learn more real life stuffs.Is this possible that i got insomnia from quitting gaming after being addicted for years?2. How can i cure nautrally ? I will try.3. Are there people that insomnia go aways on its own after a perid of time?I want to know your guys opinions because i really feel hopeless and sad and sometimes i really want to cry because all my family and friends can sleep well and can't.Sorry if my grammar is bad . i cannot check my grammar back since i am in middle of the night and have to battle with my bed again.
Signal	So my sleep goes in waves , it’s never consistent. Right now it’s at his worse : I have been awake for more than 24 hours at this point (uh like 2 days/nights its never happened to me before) and I surprisingly still function fine. I don’t feel tired and don’t feel sick. The only thing that I noticed has changed, is my heart rate. It’s actually higher than usual.However, my fitbit says that i’ve slept for 4 hours (I know it’s never super accurate) despite my eyes being closed, I clearly remember being awake and aware of my surroundings and occasionaly take look at the time.Is this okay/normal? I feel like i’m never gonna pass out and it makes me anxious.
NotSignal	I have to walk 10 miles a day in my job and I don’t have insomnia but I’m currently not sleeping lol don’t think I can book the time off work so should I just grin and bare it even if I collapse? I’m lost guys on what to do
Signal	This is the third bout of insomnia where the fear is back for the third time. The first bout lasted around 6 months where I was only getting a few hours of sleep a night, this was about a year ago. I recovered finally and the second bout happened several weeks ago and lasted about 5 days. Now I'm having the third bout and so far going on 3 days of not being able to sleep till 5 or 6 am. I'm exhausted and worried, because my mind seems so fixated on falling asleep that I don't. I will start to drift off then wake up immediately. I feel a band or pressure on my head, or like I'm closing my eyes too hard, and sometimes a thought will come in and I feel a head rush of fear. How do I stop paying attention so much to when I fall asleep? This seems very difficult to control and I'm worried about this not going away, I can't live my life like this anymore.
NotSignal	I woke up after an hour of sleep to sharp pain in my left shoulder. I can't fall back asleep, it hurts too much. I need some help.
Signal	its currently 3:30 am. i work nights on weekends bc the morning and day staff are horrible to work with and if imma b up all night might as well make some money. but going to high school during the week on a couple hours of sleep every night is fucking hell
NotSignal	I am getting worried. For the past coupe weeks it's been taking me 2 hours or more to fall asleep. I start to nod off but continuously wake up. I really don't want this to be the new trend. Somehow it might be tied to paranoia of going unconscious and sleeping alone. Please help.
Signal	Hello. Has anyone ever tried chronotherapy at home? I read that it is difficult to do at home at is most often done in a hospital setting. I do not want to to into a hospital setting to do this.My sleep is completely delayed. Today I fell asleep 730am and woke up at 12pm. I'm not tired even though I only got four and a half hours of sleep. This is a daily occurrence.. I typically fall asleep around 5 or 6 and then can't get up for work. I've tried SO HARD to get up earlier but it feels like the middle of the night and I end up laying back down for some relief and fall asleep immediately.
Signal	I’m at a loss. I can’t fall asleep. It all started when I got depersonalization from the flu last week. It was freaking me out and got worse. Then Saturday night I couldn’t sleep at all because my thoughts weren’t making any sense and scared me. Then when it was finally blank I still couldn’t sleep. And it’s been like that ever since.I’m dealing with both concerns: 1) how long is my depersonalization episode going to last... and 2) when can I finally fall asleep without relying on drugs?Last night I took 4 Benadryl in the span of 8 hours and still didn’t sleep. I felt like I dreamed but I don’t remember waking up. I just opened my eyes like I’ve been awake the whole time. On Sunday I found myself waking up, but I’m so depersonalized that it felt so weird and not right. I think I slept 2-3 hours. I’m so depersonalized I don’t even know if I slept a little last night and that’s scaring me. I’ve tried melatonin, rescueremedy, Benadryl, tea, breathing/meditation, silence, tv I’m the background, imagining a story in my head, etc and nothing has worked.I almost can’t even believe this is happening to me. I don’t want to take any sleeping pills especially since I’m depersonalized. Everything I’m reading sounds so risky and dangerous but I’m so desperate/out of it that I want to be sedated already. Another worry is that even when I do sleep, will it feel like I slept? And will I be able to sleep again on my own? I’m worried this is gonna last forever.Last night I was really relaxed.... and still couldn’t sleep. That’s what is also worrying me to death.I don’t feel like myself. And it’s making me feel like I’m in hell.Please don’t recommend me any sleeping pill unless it’s COMPLETELY safe with no amnesia, hallucinations, sleepwalking, dependence etc as a potential side effect. I’m vulnerable to that right now.I feel lost and scared... I don’t know what to do.
NotSignal	I'm posting here in hope that others will relate.This is extremely hard to describe and English isn't my first language so I will do my best.Since I was a child I've been getting this weird mix of uneasyness and wrong sensory processing spazzes. It feels something like this:I get sick or really tired and feel very weak in general.I start to feel uneasy. The same kind of feeling you get when you think about something that is very wrong or how you would feel if you were forced to do something you're really uncomfortable with.When I close my eyes I usually feel dizzy and as if I was really drunk, I feel like I'm spinning.Now, the WEIRDEST thing; I also feel like I can't fathom or feel what size or weight something/someone is. For example: if I'm holding my boyfriend's hand when I feel like this, I really feel like my hand is either really really big or really really small and his hand too and the size I'm analyzing constantly shifts. I remember when I was a child and I got sick and pretty weak, I took the TV remote and immediately threw the remote across the room because it took me by surprise how its size and weight wasn't how it's supposed to be. Like, imagine expecting to have a remote in your hand but NOPE it's just a single spaghetti. Pretty freaky. Also it's not just my sensations, I get this feeling when I'm just imagining things. Like if I'm imagining that I'm getting dropped at the airport, something feels very wrong about the luggage I'm carrying. I can't properly imagine it's size or weight.Now I feel like I sound really crazy and maybe I should seek professional help. I read some things about the Alice in Wonderland syndrome but I don't think it's that bad, I just get it sometimes when I'm really tired, like if I had a few short nights in a row. It also doesn't last that long, giving my body what it needs easily fixes the issue. Just wanted to know if others get that feeling sometimes too!
Signal	I’ll start by saying that I’ve always had issues with sleep. When I was a kid, my mom would joke that you had to beat me over the head with a club to get me to sleep before 10PM. I remember playing mellow music and being able to listen to an entire album of songs before finally falling asleep in my late elementary years. High school saw quite a few 2AM nights, from not being able to sleep, to staying awake talking to friends, to finishing mountains of assignments. College years found a few more late nights. I started dating a “night owl.” Unfortunately late nights were encouraged, despite my early schedule. But my field research and intense coursework caught up to me and brought me back to a normal schedule. After school, my work found me in some days at 7:30AM–leaving home at 6:15. I was in a bad relationship. I wasn’t happy. But my job was physically taxing, so I found sleep easily. I couldn’t find myself asleep before 11PM. That’s normal, though. As the relationship fell apart, I found a few late nights here and there, but nothing absurd. Out of the relationship, still in the physically taxing job, and back at the hour long commute (on a good day). Sleep wasn’t a worry. I started dating my current partner. You guys—I NAPPED with him! I could nap! A miracle! Never before had this ever been a possibility for me! We moved close to work, cutting our hour long drive to a 15 minute walk. Busy life. Active job. Out like a light. Now to the present, where I join you again. I find myself (age 24) furloughed. I exercise moderately. Eat healthy. But damn. I cannot fall asleep easily. I find myself wide awake at midnight. If I lay down in bed, without a good day’s worth of activities, I stay wide awake for a solid hour. I don’t use my phone in bed. If I’m desperate, I reach for a mellow podcast at a low volume. On a good night, I’m out within 45 minutes. I’ve started taking melatonin, which knocks me out well. Great. But then I wake up with the grogginess I can’t shake. It makes me sleep later and later. 11-noon if my body has its way. I have nothing to wake up for, so I can’t seem to wake up. Every morning I open my eyes, feeling like it’s 4AM. I can’t wake up at a decent time. It pushes into my falling asleep. Without the melatonin, I can’t fall asleep. I wake up exhausted and sleep far too late. With the melatonin, I can’t wake up. I wake up exhausted and sleep far too late. Last night, I managed to fall asleep at 4AM. I slept until 10:30. I know that’s not a terrible total time—but it will be if it continues. I could be asked back to work—in at 7:30–at a moment’s notice. So, hello again.
NotSignal	It’s hard to explain but when things are normal I go into a different mind space for sleep but today I just close my eyes and it’s like I’m still looking ahead even though it’s pitch black from my eyes being closed
NotSignal	Every night for like a month now when i go to sleep around 12-1am I get 4-6 hours of sleep sometimes without waking other times i wake to use toilet. The problem is that afer that inwake up and whenever i try getting back to sleep i fall into an endless loop of rem sleep and waking up every hour. That used to happen to me for the whole night but now it happen in the morning hours after i havw some good sleep i think. Anyone has the same problem ?
Signal	So I've been suffering from insomnia and unrefreshing sleep for about two weeks now, taking a long time to fall asleep and waking up earlier than usual, not being able to fall back asleep or nap during the day. Average of 4-6 hours of sleep a night (if I'm lucky). Sometimes not even an hour.Tonight, for the third time in about three months, I had an episode of waking up to intense adrenaline and racing pounding heartbeat. The last time it happened I got so unsettled that I couldn't sleep anything for the rest of the night, but today I was able to fall back asleep. Normally this is happening A LOT when trying to nap during the day. My brain will just jolt me awake when I'm in that "transition" from awake to asleep.So my question is: is this common with Sleep Apnea sufferers? I'm kinda doubting that I could have this condition because I've never snored in my life, I have average weight and this kind of thing never happened before my anxiety started flaring up again these past few weeks. I've been having A LOT of sleep anxiety, insomnia and unrefreshing sleep, making me fatigued the whole day.And on the off chance that it could be Sleep Apnea, should I be scared of continuing to take my prescribed clonazepam before bed? Could I stop breathing and die in my sleep? Kinda scared about this, and I can't get tested anytime soon because of the quarantine, so I'm on my own. My psych prescribed me clonazepam to take before sleep, but I'm scared of taking it now! And dying of respiratory depression or something.
NotSignal	I feel like fucking crying, I don't know what to do I've tried everything to try to fucking sleep but it doesn't work
NotSignal	If any ladies are down to kik. Please PM. I just need someone to talk too.
Signal	IM SO FUCKING TIRED BUT CANT SLEEP ALL I WANNA DO IS SLEEP, I CANT. ITS BEEN GOING ON FOR 5 YESRS AND IM TIRED, TIRED OF EVERYTHING I WANT WCERYTHING TO END ITS 6 AM AND SCHOOL STARTS AT 8 PM WITH A FUCK. I dont wanna die, I just want something to fix this, something to make me fall asleep, people constantly that I look like a zombie and I should sleep more, I cant. I usually go for a run outside at 3 am and try to sleep,it doesnt work. Nothing works. I can go 2 days without sleeping, feeling lonely, cant sleep, bad grades, ugly
NotSignal	I’ve been really struggling and this is creating a ton of anxiety regarding my own health. I was just wondering if there’s somebody who has been struggling through this for awhile but is still overall healthy. I need to ease my mind a little lol.
NotSignal	My schedule has changed recently from shift work to day work, and I'm doing one day on -- one off right after getting out of quarantine. My sleep has been totally wrecked because of all this. No matter what I've tried I can't sleep the nights before work, because my body just doesn't get tired until like 6-7am, when I need to be waking up for work. This is the 4th night (thankfully not in a row) where I haven't slept. The most I can do is try not to drive, and stay up until 10pm I suppose.Also, do melatonin pills make much of a difference? I might try those.
NotSignal	Not sure if right sub but hopefully someone can help a lil bit. My partner has nightmares almost every other night. They aren’t like scared of heights nightmares but more of existential threats/corruption/violent nightmares. As a result of this (we assume) he wakes up covered in sweat. Like to the point the mattress and any pillows or blankets are wet. He doesn’t think therapy sessions work/are for him due to past experiences. Any advice or resources for how to move forward with this would be appreciated!
